K Varjeer",,4th November 2023,Business,Business Class,Bangalore to New York via Abu Dhabi,August 2023,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,,5,no,2,"  The cabin experience was fine and on par with other airlines. Consequently, this review is primarily regarding Ground/Back Office Operations. It has taken the Airlines more than 2 months and multiple contacts and misdirection to inform me that I need to contact American Airlines to claim Frequent Flier miles, in spite my having specified my AA number on the reservation! There appears to be very little coordination between Etihad and Abu Dhabi Customs in terms of disallowed items et al and I was detained for carrying clearly labelled medications, threatened with imprisonment and fined. Needing my medication, I visited a medical institution in Abu Dhabi, and paid for a doctors's consultation and a prescription! My subsequent flight to JFK was delayed by a whole day but the way the Airline handled Hotel and transport for the delayed passengers can only be described as chaotic."

R Barnele",,30th October 2023,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Athens via Abu Dhabi,October 2023,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  The return flight from Athens to Singapore had a 9+ hours layover in Abu Dhabi, Etihad unilaterally changed the time of departure twice and since the last move exceeded the 10 hours, by airline policy I was supposed to be entitled to a complimentary hotel night stay. Of course, the airline never informed me that I was entitled to this, but I was able to contact the live chat service and ask whether I was entitled to it indeed they answered and gave me a set of instructions on how to complete the reservation prepaid by Etihad. The process was way harder than it should have, but I finally manage to get the confirmation email of the hotel. Etihad is already struggling to meet expectations at this point. On the night of the flight, I land in Abu Dhabi after a 7 hours flight, catch the taxi to the hotel at midnight and to my horror I am told that I have a reservation, but it has been cancelled by Etihad - I remain in disbelief but the hotel confirms this, I fire up my laptop and look for the Etihad chat service, it takes a lot of hurdles to speak with a human but I finally manage. It may as well been a robot: ""HI my name is XXX XXX, how can I help you?"" and from there it proceeds to tell me that the reservation was cancelled as the company later realized that I didn't meet new criteria that they never mentioned before for the free hotel booking, and that a different department decided to cancel it after it was already booked, except I was never notified. The staff at the hotel was super kind and understanding, even offered me the same preferential conditions as Etihad, but the price for the night would have been 3X the normal price at this point. I told the Etihad operator that I would be spending the rest of the night shaming their bad practices on this like this one if they had not done anything at all to make up for the mistake, which was clearly their fault, and I'm here to keep that promise. They used to have good quality service and planes, but the airline has turned into trash post covid under all aspects - this was no doubt the worst customer service experience of my life."

Old aircraft, many personal screens not working properly, usb plug in for charging phones etc not working, service not great. But the worst of all: luggage was delayed. Was easy to put in a claim for money spent for urgent needed items until the luggage arrived, then the tedious work started: links they sent re the claim weren’t working and emails didn’t have clear instruction. I was forced to sign up as a guest member to go ahead with the claim. Difficult to find phone numbers to contact them directly, then no one answered, even not the option to leave a voice mail. They sent emails from email accounts which were no longer valid when sending an answer a few hours later, no indication which email to use for them so ended up having a minimum of 4 different email addresses and none of them seem to have been the correct one. All in all, many emails had to be sent, weren't answered detailed, but in a standard way. The whole process took 3 months. I will never fly with them again!"

I followed all the procedures that needed to be followed, I called their useless customer/ luggage center on a daily basis, but nothing much has changed. The only thing they can say is that we email the officer and they are going to contact you as soon as possible. After 21 days of waiting for the luggage to be located or traced, you will need to start a new long journey of 28 days waiting for them scratching their heads to think about the reimbursement amount. Once they decide to reimburse you( a set of money that doesn't cover even one-third the value of your luggage), you have to fill out a PDF full of abbreviations. Here, the journey of replying to their emails and spending decades waiting for their reply starts. Once you decide to call them, they will reply in a disrespectful way saying that the process takes 30 days for the money transfer to be reflected on your account. Overall, I will never travel on that airline and it is not recommended at all."

Rohith Jayawardene",Boeing 787 ,24th October 2023,Business,Business Class,Bangkok to Abu Dhabi via Phuket ,October 2023,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,4,yes,8,"  Having recently enjoyed a great time on Etihad's A380, I was looking forward to the flight on the newly refurbished Boeing 787 . However, at Bangkok Airport, the check-in desks were probably the worst I've encountered. The two business class desks looked plain and unwelcoming. There were two dirty worn-out pieces of carpet, bearing the word 'business', that were a sorry sight. The woman at the check-in desk would not smile or even utter a word of greeting. Instead, simply went through the process of passport check and handed me the boarding pass. I had to ask for a voucher for the lounge, to which she replied 'OK' and proceeded to find one and hand it to me.  I was disappointed, as a few rows back the Thai Airlines counters were all gorgeous looking, with floral decorations and clean.  The business class cabin looked beautiful, and the colours soothing. The cabin crew were smiling and welcomed me, I was served with champagne and hot towel and wished a good flight. The seat design is the same as in the A380. Wide and comfortable, with options to adjust for a harder or softer feel. Also provided was a large pillow, soft mattress and duvet. On the side table was an Acqua di Parma amenity kit. The storage compartment on the side of the seat contained the headphones, water bottle and space for storing smaller items. The IFE was very easy to use. Though not a great number of new movies, there was enough I think to satisfy everyone. The flight to Abu Dhabi was with a stop in Phuket to pick up more passengers. Therefore during the short one hour flight, I was served with drinks and a selection of tiny morsels of finger food. Asked whether I enjoyed it, I replied 'I don't know what it all was, but it tasted damn good'. Once the rest of the passengers boarded at Phuket and hot towels were given, pre-departure drinks were served. I opted for a delicious mint drink, and soon we were on our way, on time, to Abu Dhabi. Mohammed, the Cabin Manager, was exceptionally obliging and engaging with passengers in the nearly full 28-seat cabin. Other crew members were taking dinner orders. With the 'dine on demand' service, I decided to have my dinner as soon as possible, to get some sleep. I omitted any starters and went for the main course of braised rib steak, followed by a cheese board. A turndown service was offered. However, I managed to set up the mattress myself and, following a coffee and cognac, I settled for a two hour sleep and was woken up as requested two-hours before arrival. The cabin crew came around speaking to awake passengers, and checking if they needed anything. Overall the service was excellent. My only wee complaint is, as in night flights, providing pyjamas would have added that extra comfort to an otherwise perfect flight experience."

Rohith Jayawardene",A380,24th October 2023,Business,Business Class,London Heathrow to Abu Dhabi,October 2023,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,4,yes,10,"  It was good to see Etihad had brought back its A380 fleet especially on the London to Abu Dhabi route.  I built up much anticipation for my upcoming flights. From the speedy and friendly check-in to the comfortable lounge, and being addressed by name on boarding, I felt I was on a memorable flight. The upper deck has both forward and rear-facing seating referred to as business studios. I had selected a forward-facing window seat, which also has additional storage bins by the windows. The seat felt very comfortable with options to adjust for a harder or softer feel. Also provided was a large pillow, soft mattress and duvet. On the side table was an Acqua di Parma amenity kit. The storage compartment on the side of the seat contained the headphones, water bottle and space for smaller items. Following the usual pre-flight champagne and hot towels, the cabin crew came around to take orders for lunch. I found the 'dine on demand' concept especially useful. In addition, an à la carte 'all day menu' enables you to order quite a tempting selection of items like a steak sandwich, salads, cheeses and crackers and ice cream. Soon after take off, the bar service began, and I settled for a JD on ice which was served with warm nuts. One crew member invited me to the small lounge, (which can seat up to six passengers), and have a light snack and more drinks before my late lunch. And it was served on time, with a delicious Arabic Meze for starters, and stone sea bass for the main course. The Chardonnay served, followed the etiquette of showing the bottle, and tasting before pouring, which I appreciated. The IFE was very easy to use. Though not a great number of first-run movies, there was something to satisfy everyone. What I did come across was that you could order drinks from the bar through your IFE - something I had not come across before. On the return red-eye flight, I did manage to get some sleep. My one slight disappointment was no pyjamas were provided. The cabin crew were excellent, checking up on me, engaging in short chats, and offering to top up my drinks. While the hard product on most airlines' long-haul business class is good, what makes a good flight a great flight is the onboard service. And here, Etihad are on the top of their game."

Ian Tupper",,23rd October 2023,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Melbourne to Düsseldorf via Abu Dhabi ,October 2023,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,4,yes,8," Our two flights with Etihad were smooth and reasonably enjoyable for a 27-hour journey. Etihad check-in staff were friendly and made an effort to resolve problems. However, we did not appreciate the moneygrubbing attitude of the airline in restricting carry-on to a single piece: difficult with anyone with a laptop. Cabin staff were efficient, welcoming and gave excellent service. Meals were tasty, with ample portions available. We appreciated it that they were served in a timely manner: no waiting for hours after take-off. The airline provided a kit for the first overnight flight, with eye-mask, earplugs, sanitisers and toothbrush: this was very much appreciated. Entertainment channel was good, with a fairly wide selection, although short on European movies and music. Transit through Abu Dhabi was a negative, with long queues in compulsory screening. The Al-Dhabi lounge at Abu Dhabi is not to be recommended: more like a student mensa, with crowds of passengers and limited seating. Disembarkation and luggage collection went smoothly."

TK Benzimra",,14th October 2023,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Manchester to Abu Dhabi via Bangkok,October 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," I am extremely unhappy with the service I received today. I was unaware as I booked through a travel agent that I was not allowed a handbag and a carry on. What airline does not allow this? I’ve never heard of this before. I was a solo student traveling and the manager at Manchester airport was extremely rude and unhelpful to me. Her words when I was crying of stress was “either you throw your belongings away, pay £600 or miss you flight but you better hurry up because check in closes in 5 minutes”. That is the same price as my entire flight. I eventually threw whatever I could away (this being school books) as that’s all I could and got it down to 9kgs which then cost me £480. I am furious. That was my entire holiday spending money spent on a carry on bag. Please tell me how this is ok? A friend told me they flew Lufthansa last week and paid £100 for an entire 23kg extra back. I paid x5 that for a small 9kgs bag that could fit in the overhead. I will never fly Etihad again and I will make sure everyone I know does not either. This is daylight robbery and just completely unacceptable. "

You'll get an A380 with a proper screen seats and meal on a 7 hour flight from London and then have to endure one of the worst seats with no screens attached and worst food you can find for 5 hours. Don't do it, try any of the other carriers first."

L Hayne",A380 / A330-200,9th October 2023,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Jakarta via Abu Dhabi,October 2023,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,2,no,2,"   I booked with Etihad so i could experience Etihad. Instead on my flight to Jakarta i got a service on par with a low cost airline. To begin with at online checkin you try selling me a business class product that you knew you could not provide. You also try to sell me an empty seat/row that you also knew you could not provide. I was only able to partially do online check in. The checkin agent could not move me to a window seat, even though when i boarded there was one available two rows behind. When i arrived to Abu Dhabi had to use the transfer service desk. The person who printed off my boarding passed lied to me telling i had a window seat. The boarding process at Abu Dhabi, no speaker system, and no zoning system. Once onboard i found my seat, in the middle of the aircraft in front of the toilets, it was extremely warm and uncomfortable. The row either side of the toilets are known to be the worst seats on any airline, due to the queues and the noise from the flush. I asked to change seats but apparently they’re was a 100% load factor on the flight. Was provided an extremely small snack as the first meal. On both flights the trolley for the drinks only came pass twice These been no explanation in the change of equipment and I’m really disappointed."

C Hardy",Boeing 787-10,8th October 2023,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Abu Dhabi,October 2023,2.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,2,no,3,"   I just traveled from Singapore to Abu Dhabi on an Etihad B787, row 15. I was excited to fly Etihad as online and through their marketing it looked like a great airline but my experience was far from it, and the sad thing is the staff didn't care. First we took off 75m late. We boarded on time and only 30mins after take off time did the pilot say we had a problem that was fixed and we would be leaving soon, we taxied towards the runway and the pilot stopped the plane and said the fault re appeared so we were stopping. We stopped for 20 or so mins then started moving back the same direction we came from with no further announcement by the pilot until another 25 mins later after a very slow taxi to the most remote runway in Singapore he announced to the cabin crew to prepare for takeoff. The pilot didn't make the normal post take off announcement and we only heard from the flight crew when we were landing so the care and attention about their passengers was poor with no info what was happening. On board the plane felt like it was falling apart, tray tables were dirty, all the pockets containing things like the safety on board card were all falling apart (see photo), the seats wouldnt recline properly the crew didn't care. We were with our baby and were not offered a basinett even though we were in a basinett seat and the staff refused to help us collect rubbish from the floor to throw away when they came around to collect rubbish and we were trying to deal with 2 children. They said quite rudely to give them the rubbish and then just walked off leaving it there because they didn't want to reach down to collect it. I gave feedback to one staff member who just looked at me blankly. We had to deplane via stairs and a bus, Etihad deplaned all business class first leaving us stood outside in the heat with a baby waiting for a bus as they wouldn't put us on a half empty business class bus. Overall a really poor and disappointing experience, certainly not customer first."

W Bausler",Boeing 787-9,6th October 2023,Business,Economy Class,Singapure to Vienna via Abu Dhabi,September 2023,1.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,,2,no,5,"   Our luggage was damaged during the flight from Singapore to Vienna. One suitcase had a rubber band covering the zip torn and the second suitcase had a support foot broken off. At the airport in Vienna, there were no Etihad counters where this could be reported. You can only make an online report. We reported the incident and sent a photo of the damage. Etihad replied that the damage was only minor and that they would not cover the costs (repair or new purchase). This means that we have to pay for the repair ourselves, which is simply an impertinence. Regarding the flight itself, it has to be said that the seating comfort in economy class is miserable. I have never felt so cramped on any other flight.  The airport in Abu Dhabi is the next point of criticism. The flight was operated with a Boeing 787-9 and was handled at a gate where there were seats for a maximum of 100 people. The remaining 200 people had to stand until boarding started. The transfer to the aircraft was done by bus, which led to a lengthy check-in process. We will never book flights with Etihad again."

What a stupid company these guys are running. What the hell they are doing until the last minute. I was prepared from home that I upgraded to Business Class and what a disappointment.

I have now been fighting with Etihad for a refund on my return ticket from Athens to Melbourne on 15/08/22 for more than one year. Despite the ticket being fully refundable and receiving email correspondence from the airline that the refund will be deposited within my account within 7 to 45 days, this has not happened. I have made countless phone calls which last more than one hour due to staff incompetence, placed on hold endlessly and many promises that the refund will be made verbally and in writing via email and on your chat support site, and this still has not occurred. I will never fly with Etihad again. Customer Service is an absolute disgrace and eventually customers like me just give up because it becomes not worth the fight. "

Antoni Kirschner",Boeing 787,25th September 2023,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Manchester to Doha via Abu Dhabi,September 2023,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,2,no,2,"  Flight EY16 on 12 Sep. Tickets were not cheap, £1500 Manchester to Doha for 2 people in the heat season. Seats were narrow with no legroom to give a reasonable comfort. We were hoping to get at least a nice service with a smile. Forget that. Flight attendants were murdy, some were not even looking straight at passengers, some during disembarkment looked like they were involved in solving a psychological problem of their own. The only bright star was a Moroccan female flight attendant Khadija, who was smiling on board. (I hope the airline will not punish her for that.) On my flight back to Manchester via Abu Dhabi (from Doha) we missed the first leg of the trip due to my wife’s illness and the Dubai Etihad headquarters offered to reschedule for £824 (an hour long flight!) while at the same the available ticket on skyscanner.net went for £86. Our hotel manager had to shout at them in a rude manner to make them realise they were so wrong and unprofessional in their attitude and eventually offer a free rebooking for a later flight. So, in conclusion, where am I with my dealings with Etihad? I feel badly serviced for a price and successful in escaping a rip-off in an emergency situation."

It does exist with Etihad flights. Not only were our seats downgraded from Economy space to Economy, while obviously paying for economy space, we then received the only broken entertainment seats of the plane for a 14h flight. Etihad staff just passed us on from checkin staff to gate staff to transit staff without one person being interested in our matter. Pleasure now dealing with the phone customer service for a refund. If you can avoid flying with Etihad do it, otherwise brace yourself for being downgraded while paying the higher price."

I Bennett ",,11th September 2023,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Tel Aviv to Melbourne via Abu Dhabi,September 2023,2.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,,1,no,1," The worst service and horrific baggage handling practices! This was a round trip. It started well on the way to our holiday with a relatively good service. It all changed on the flight home to Melbourne. Our flight was delayed. We were forced to wait at an enclosed gate location without water nearby, after they forced us to throw out our water over 100 ml. By the time we boarded, we were dehydrated with a headache. The aircraft staff was busy and dismissive. Shortly after locating my seat, I discovered that it was wet smelling like urine. It took my fellow passenger going directly to one of the staff for them to actually address my wet seat and replace it. The troubles didn't stop there, as the crew seemed to neglect air conditioning and we flew for 13 hours in an approximately 30-35 degree Celsius cabin. The food was questionable. The cabin crew was mainly dismissive during the flight and I simply needed to go in person to the galley to get some water. The worst part was receiving my newly purchased suitcase (Samsonite) damaged. I approached the Etihad arrivals desk for help and was assured that they will cover the costs of repair or replacement. Pictures of the damages were taken and a damage report was issued. I went to repair my suitcase, and lodged a claim to get reimbursed. The baggage damage team till this day refuses to take any responsibility for the damages their airline personnel caused to my new suitcase, deeming the damages as ""minor"". Any request to clarify how a $110 repair is considered minor was met with ""the case is closed, we are sorry you are not happy with this outcome"". This is the airline I will definitely avoid at all cost!"

We booked extra space seats and neighbour free seats, they were happy to take our money. They gave the neighbour free seat to another person and we have paperwork to prove this, when we got on the plane, the economy space seats were economy. This happened on both legs, the cabin managers, said it happens daily and Etihad do not care. We have tried contacting them and even sent a recorded delivery, which they signed for. It was only when we did a charge back through the bank that they disputed things. How, I have no idea, we have pictures of the seats being incorrect, we have invoices, e:mails, paperwork galore and till they deny doing anything wrong. The airline has no morals, they do not care about reviews, complaints or anything, they do not care how much they ruin your holiday, but trust me I tell everyone who I know wants to travel with them, and working in the travel industry, this is a lot of people never to fly with them."

A380 service to Abu Dhabi was rather disappointing given all the hype and advertising, seating in the upper deck is claustrophobic and cramped. The on board lounge falls significantly short of the Emirates product, it is dark, gloomy and rather depressing. The standard of the catering has really dropped too, even the champagne is almost undrinkable. Amenity kit is a waste of time too, the fancy leather pouch was the most useful thing about it. On board service was indifferent and quite rushed. Despite the attractive pricing I doubt that Etihad will see me again any time soon."

Neither the app or the customer service is at the expected level to assist you properly before and after. I had similar situation with a lowfare company called Cebu Pacific and process was smooth and easy. Customer team responded within 24 hours and resolve my issue Fare from Etihad is 2 to 3 times higher but service is not. Very disappointed and will avoid Etihad in the future.

The B787 of flight EY32 on August 23, 2023 was quite new, the boarding was quite efficient and fast. The flight attendants (both female and male) greeted us with big smile. We were served by two female flight attendants, Leena and Sayaka who were very friendly, helpful and excellent service mind. Both of them had to deal with a number of babies (who were very naughty and moving around and of course some of them crying almost all the time) and they did perfectly. Leena and Sayaka always asked us about the drinks and also told us to keep seatbelt fasten for safety. The food was quite delicious and serve well. Although flight EY408 from Abu Dhabi to Bangkok the cabin staff were quite good but the attention and service cannot be compared with the previous flight mentioned above."

The EY 409 flight for Bangkok to Abu Dhabi by Boeing 787 was uneventful. The plane is quite new and the flight attendants (female) is OK and quite friendly. We did not have food served due to our rest. The plane arrived on time. However, the next flight EY85 from Abu Dhabi to Rome was different. The flight attendant (male) was quite unresponsive and not quite friendly. He served passengers with no smile just as he was doing his job. The food was OK and the flight was smooth and arrived a little ahead of schedule. We expected more for a premium airline like Etihad Airways but quite disappointed (my friends who travel with us share the same feeling)."

Etihad is worse than Air Arabia Flight Air conditioning was off till we were in air about 1 and half hour. We had to take bus to reach the aircraft, and due to that we were made to board early. It was really suffocating. Seats were highly uncomfortable, no leg space, no proper backrest. Would definitely not suggest or prefer to travel with Etihad again"

It is a budget experience with a price tag. You have to pay for your seats, will get randomly allocated on check in if you don’t. The staff seemed meek and inexperienced on board. There was one toilet out of order which meant two different parts of the plane on the same side had to use one toilet. Lines of 7-10 at one point and the cleanliness was horrific. Abu Dhabi airport is also a terrible stop over. Gates don’t get announced until close to your time and not much sitting room. Will never fly Etihad again."

Agron Hasani",Boeing 787-10,18th August 2023,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Dublin via Abu Dhabi,August 2023,1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3,no,1," We booked a holiday through a tour-operator who chose Etihad. I hadn't flown with this airline before so didn't know what to expect. Our crew (my wife, 2 teenagers and myself) opted to pay some 510 euro so we could sit together. Since the aircraft configuration is 3-3-3, we decided the 3 of my family would sit behind me and since I am 193 cm tall, I chose extra legroom seat. 1 day before departure (19 July 2023), we realised the seating was changed and no prior notice received. I spent 1 hour in the online chat and the agent managed to fix their blunder but only after I paid again (I was told: trust me, I would help you if I could). I purchased it and said to myself I'll sort it later. On our return, the same was noticed when checking in online. Close to 2 hours of our holiday spent chatting to someone who assured me he finally fixed the issue and asked me to save transcript of chat as evidence. Flight from Koh Samui to BKK with Bangkok airlines who couldn't issue boarding passes for the entire trip so in BKK had to go to transfer desk to get these issued and the agent there told us that the issue was not resolved and he 'fixed' it then and there. Flight from Bangkok to Abu Dhabi was OK. In Abu Dhabi when getting ready to board, a rude ground staff agent tore my boarding pass and issued me a new one which wasn't extra leg room which was paid for. When I asked, she simply said: 'all seats on the aircraft are fee-paying'. Absolutely shocking. Back for 2 weeks and emailed them using the appropriate form to try get an apology and a refund (out of principle). This is their response: ""Thank you for your email. We are sorry we were unable to contact you by telephone to discuss your case.  We have reviewed your booking and conclude that your reservation of seats does not qualify for a refund. There may be last-minute operational changes that mean we need to allocate you a different seat. If this happens, we will always try to choose a similar seat for you"". The aircraft was 787 so no real issues with it. Felt old, seats hard and uncomfortable butt hat is subjective. Flight attendants were OK and the plane was clean. Purchased wifi on the flight from Dublin to Abu Dhabi and then to BKK but it was extremely patchy and unreliable. Attitude of support team even the social media team was appalling. I will never ever fly Etihad. Why bother when they do not care about customers. At the end of the day, Qatar and Emirates are better rated and appear to care about the passengers and their experience"

I had a personal injury and arrived 1 hour prior to departure time instead of 3 hours and they wouldn’t even listen to me although I kept saying I’m pregnant and to add to that I had a personal injury when getting into the car en route to the airport. He wouldn’t even hear out and kept saying check in closed. Other airlines wait for the passengers even after boarding is completed. This is ridiculous behavior and it’s sad that they call themselves a family airline when they hire supervisors who are nasty.

During my recent journey from London Heathrow to Manila with a layover at Abu Dhabi, I experienced several issues that significantly impacted my travel experience. The primary concern arose at the boarding gate of my connecting flight from AUH to MNL. Upon my initial inquiry at LHR, I was informed that a paid upgrade at the boarding gate is possible. With this understanding, my sister and I, both flying due to a family bereavement, were looking forward to a comfortable experience in business class. However, when I approached the ground staff at the AUH boarding gate, I was informed that the upgrade was possible however, I need to have it processed at the transfer desk, despite my understanding that it could be arranged and paid at the boarding gate. The transfer desk staff at AUH had previously affirmed the possibility of an upgrade at the boarding gate, I noted a discrepancy in the level of service provided by the cabin crew during my flight from LHR to AUH. My journey  could have been notably positive with a minor additional assistance, and I believe such small gestures can greatly impact passenger perception. "

Although not a horrible aircraft the ground crew and brand made the experience deplorable, the airline assigned seats randomly in the aircraft for our honey moon, one leg of our flight was overbooked, and some passengers had to stay. Airport at Abu Dhabi is not a place for a long connection, bathrooms were not sanitary. When demanding our claim airport staff refused to attend our plea and asked us to go through the website. Overall feels like a company that once wanted to compete with Emirates, but stopped trying and just gets leftover traffic in the middle east."

The stewards and stewardesses were kind, this is the good point I can give. The food was okay too, but the seat leg room was inferior to other companies we took in Economy class for Japan (ANA, Swiss, etc.) I have leg problems and it was really painful. The seat material was scratchy. The worst, we had to pay for choosing our seats during online check-in so we could be together (we were separated during the first flight.) We had 4 flights in total and in 2 of them, the entertainment screen was dirty and they didn't have eye-masks and ear plus available for everyone depending where you were sitting. The layover in Abu-Dhabi was awful. I thought it would be pleasant, since this is a wealthy country, but nothing: long bus travel to the terminal, just a cramped small corridor, uncomfortable chair, very expensive options if you need to rest. It just felt messy. I am sorry as I don't like to badmouth companies usually, but I feel like I had to, as both my husband, my mother and I were expecting so much more from Etihad (which is sometimes compared to the WAY better Emirates.) Again, the positive point was the staff on board, and the flights were on time. The entertainment had enough choices, though less than in other airlines I took. I paid for the WiFi during one of the trips, and to be honest it was useless, it didn't work most of the time."

Then the next day I came to the airport after the bus was delayed by 3 hours, boarded the plane, we went up the runway and they took us back because Sydney Airport had a curfew for planes and we would of not made it on time.

R Hoffmann",,16th July 2023,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to Kochi via Abu Dhabi,June 2023,4.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,,1,no,2," I flew from Munich to Kochi via Abu Dhabi with an infant and my 5 year old child. We had booked the bassinet seats more than a month prior to the travel and they were confirmed. During online check-in we found that for the second leg, the seats were changed. Initially booked seats were 6A and 6B. However, they moved my seat to 6E and my daughter's seat a couple of rows behind and it was not possible to book the seats together online. The flight was the same type. I contacted support and they said it could be a technical fault or something and we can change it at the airport. At Munich airport, they agreed that the change of seats were unacceptable (from the automatic assignment) and that they cannot make a child sit in another row from the parent. However, they said they cannot change the seat from Munich but the boarding staff ""should"" change it at Abu Dhabi airport. At Abu Dhabi, they said the flight is full and we should have got this changed earlier. The cabin crew asked to initially sit in the assigned seat and that they can get us seated together when boarding is complete. I did not want to leave my crying daughter in another row and luckily the person in seat 6F said that he can move to my daughter's seat. The seats 6A-6D were given to a family with older children. Flying with children is not easy and Etihad made this a really bad experience. We booked Etihad owing to the good schedule even though the price was quite high owing to the holiday period. We sent a complaint 3 weeks ago and we have still not received any replies."

Customer service is non-existent and when you do get in contact, they are rude and uninterested in your concerns. I have been trying to book a flight using my Air miles (600,000 miles) to several destinations for 8 MONTHS and Etihad claims that they don't have a single available seat on ANY aircraft on ANY date to multiple destinations over the span of 8 months. Customer service keeps arguing that they can't do anything and no proper manager will ever get to the phone to explain this. Furthermore, staff and service in general has become a joke. There is no Customer loyalty, no genuine interest to help customers (especially someone who has been flying with Etihad frequently for 10+ years). I am completely displeased and fed up with Etihad. I will indefinitely be switching to Emirates where customers are appreciated and service is actually something that is cared about."

I was surprised and thought it would be system error. So I checked again after 2 days and the issue was same. I was concerned, so called cleartrip (from where I booked my tkt) to check what was wrong and they said first leg journey was cancelled by Etihad, saying flight was cancelled. Firstly, I was never informed either via sms or email about this cancellation. Had I not checked it out of coincidence, I would never have known about this cancellation until my journey day. Secondly, airline did not bother to offer alternate option to me. The airline website showed same flight (which was apparently cancelled) taking new bookings.  I opted for cancellation of ticket and refund on 5-6-23, however, till today 11-7-23 I am yet to receive any refund. Cleartrip says they are following the airline but still no news at all."

The representative was sarcastic and said he cannot help. When I explained to them and asked why the other 10 representatives before them spoke differently and promised it would be refunded. Very shady. Never ever book with Etihad airways. We booked a choice plus flight ticket as our trip plan was volatile. Even after paying extra money for a flexible ticket the worst experience. Please do not book with them if you want to make changes for your ticket. Very shady airline - I cannot stress enough. I have recorded voice calls and saved chat conversations which I can submit to prove my point. You can check the confirmation they sent in the endorsement part of the ticket.

I was offered a refund or an alternate flight through my travel agent. Etihad showed complete disregard to the fact that due to their cancellation, I’ve had to incur changes in changing my hotel bookings and essentially extending my trip. My layover at AUH is now 5 hours 30 mins instead of 1 hour and 50 mins. I am travelling with a small child. All I had requested from Etihad for giving me all this trouble was to give my family access to the lounge at the airport as they have been directly responsible for the increase in our lay over time. I had not even asked for compensation for the charges I’ve had to incur to modify our holiday. Etihad showed complete disregard to this and demonstrated a clear lack of professionalism towards us in this case. Quite shocking, they are not the same airline as they used to be in the past and after the above incident, I will not be to travelling with them again and would not recommend anyone to either."

After the boarding at BCN they kept us waiting at the boarding gate until 6pm, before announcing that the flight was cancelled due to a technical fault. During that 10 hours ordeal, no one had any decency to inform the passengers of what was going on, they kept changing the departure time with the increments of 1 hours. 1 snack voucher was provided which had a value of 5€, no lunch or drinks were provided. Finally at 6pm they told everyone to collect our baggage and wait at check-in area to be given hotel spaces. The off-loaded baggage arrived after 2 hours which to me was deliberate as they wanted to minimise the time passengers would spend at the hotel. Finally after another 2 hours wait in the queue, they told everyone to wait for buses to be taken to the hotel. The hotel was 1 and a half hour drive outside of Barcelona where we finally reached at 11.30pm. There was no communication as to when we will be picked up for our next day flight etc. At 4am, we were told bus had arrived for us, so hurried to the airport where they checked everyone in for 10.15am departure. At 11am, they told us that the aircraft that had just arrived from AUH to pick us up, was faulty as well. We were all then loaded onto the busses and taken to another aircraft which was parked at a half hour drive on the other side of the airport and finally that departed with the delay of over 2 hours. Abu Dhabi airport is another disgrace, you could smell the toilets from miles away, crowded space with low ceiling and rude staff. The flight to LHE was on a Airbus A320 with no IFE and in the name of in flight meal, they presented us with a bland sandwich. I asked for a diabetic meal in advance but due to cancelled flight and their crap service, never got it. All in all, I will never fly this joke of an airline again and recommend everyone to avoid them. They are not professional, will not communicate with customers if something went wrong and just treat their customers in a worst possible way. Choose Emirates or Qatar like I always do and couldn't do it this time because of last minute travel requirement. I have learnt my lesson and will never waste a penny on these clowns."

I didn't feel anything unusual about that. When I reached Abu Dhabi the transfer desk crew told me that I cant travel on the flight which I have booked and the flight is over booked. I was shocked and I found a group of people who were in my situation, fighting with the staff as they were nearly 24 hours in Abu Dhabi for the next flight.

P Larsan",,30th May 2023,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Barcelona to Seoul via Barcelona,May 2023,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3,no,1,"  Let me share with you the awful experience I had (and still have with Etihad).It started some days before my flight (which was from the 30th of April to 1st of May, from Barcelona to Seoul, with a layoff in Abu Dhabi). Etihad has this offer where you can bid to reserve the seats on your row to have no neighbors during the flight. For my flight from Abu Dhabi to Seoul, I thought it was a good idea to reserve a seat and bid for the two seats next to me to have no neighbors, be more comfortable and get some sleep during the flight. So I bid and got the 2 extra seats reserved for me. They sent me this nice email with this great phrase ""You will enjoy a neighbor-free seat onboard."" I was very much looking forward to it. My friends, on the same flights, also did it (they were the ones that suggested me) and also got the bid won. Yet, I thought I should not get too happy, maybe they will mess up something...and that's what exactly happened. Two large men came and say: those are our seats and I was no, I reserved them. They politely acknowledge it, although Etihad really assigned them those seats. It was even more confusing because they put to those seats a little paper on the benches' head support saying they were reserved. They tried to sit one man on another reserved seat behind me but the couple that reserved it protested. In the end, the attendant came to me, apologize, and said that they probably had last minute reservation, and the plane was fully booked (not true as my friends and other passengers enjoyed their neighbor's free seat). The attendant told me that he will contact the airline to report the issue ASAP. Later I gave him my contact info on paper with all the details. But nobody contacted me. So I emailed them on the 1st of May, to which they answered: We're currently receiving a high number of emails. Thank you for your patience whilst we work through each case as quickly as possible. If your case requires a response, a member of our team will get back to you within a maximum of 14 days. I still haven't received any news 28 days later. I contacted their support services multiple times on Twitter and every time, they asked me to leave the time to the team to do their investigation. I asked them how long it will take and they stayed vague...In the first email, I also asked them to cancel the reservation I made for the seat I reserved for my flight back because I didn't want to give Etihad more money until my case was solved, but no one answered. Etihad didn't deliver a service I paid for and I strongly recommend to anyone to not bid for blocking a neighbor's seat as they can take it away from you if someone else books a ticket at the last minute, worst, they can take it away from you and make you wait, and not refund you (so far that's what happened to me). I fear I will soon have no choice but to contact a lawyer to get this problem solved.  They should have automatically acknowledged it and refunded me once those seats were taken back from me and given to other passengers. Yet, they leave me with the impression they don't seem to really care. I had issues in the past with other airlines and have always been answered in respectable delays, even during the first month of the covid pandemic that forced many airlines to cancel flights.

F Leben",,24th May 2023,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Beirut to Abu Dhabi,March 2023,,,,,,,2,no,1,  They never refunded my cancelled flight despite confirming that it would be done in 45 days. They never send you any email to confirm the cancellation they just confirm it by chat (that they don’t also forward to a email once done) then they claim it was a no show and they can’t trace back the he cancellation. Either they lie to keep the money or their system is so poor or inexistant which is quiet worrying for an airline. Lower customer service than a cheap budget airline. Would never use them again.

Andrew Davies",,23rd May 2023,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Sydney via Abu Dhabi,February 2023,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,2,no,2,"  After cancelling one of my connecting flights on my return journey, Etihad refused to rebook me on another flight. They said the only option was a refund, which I begrudgingly accepted because there was no other option. I had to spend money out of my own pocket to rebook with another airline at a much higher price because it was short notice. I have waited nearly 3 months and I have still not received a refund. Every time I contact the team either on web chat or phone they just keep stalling, they keep telling me they have to email the refunds team which will take another 5 working days, and there is no chance for me to contact them directly. This is beginning to seem like the behaviour of scam artists."

The only reason I booked with the them was the price and promise of a free hotel when doing a stopover in Abu Dhabi. There is no free a hotel it is a SCAM. First they said it is because of the F1 black out dates, even if travelling one week before that. The availability for my dates, although you cannot check the availability until you book your flight. Then you are stuck with a multi-city itinerary that does not allow any changes or cancellations. Customer service won't answer or take any responsibility. Flights were ok I guess, food was mediocre and IFE did not work properly on one of the flights. I will avoid this airline in the future and never recommend it."

Very poor web system, no possibility to do check-in online, always got error, call center agent advised that it was a system error. For both sectors surprisingly. Traveling with no luggage and infant, with departure 3 am, expected to do check-in online, save time and have smooth peaceful time, unfortunately needed to arrive earlier, go to counter and all the mess at gate after. Was no organized area next to gate, it was impossible to reach gate trough narrow rows between seats, already filled with others and their luggage, how could we expect to have priority for boarding if we could not even reach the gate. The worst part. Baby stroller arrived at Rome airport and we needed to look for it, no assistance from any Etihad staff. Stroller was damaged, full of scratches and soft part was cut. This was my first experience flying with Etihad and it was a complete shock. Out trip just for a weekend turned into so many issues : no check-in online, damaged stroller upon arrival to Rome, 1 hour waiting for stroller at Abu Dhabi airport. No possibility to travel easy and be treated really well. staff at AUH airport was not helpful at all, bounced us counter-lift-counter-lift, wait for your stroller there, wait here. Etihad is not family and customer oriented in general."

Check-in was smooth, so was the luggage processing. Their officer (JED airport) was pretty flexible with we taking a bit extra weight on the cabin.

The seats were really uncomfortable which I noticed within 30 secs and continued to be uncomfortable throughout the flight. The support (bottom) part barely covered from buttocks to half the thigh. I am 5ft 3"".The seat cushions hard and the fabric rough. Almost no space between seats so you can not reach the things you may have in your bag below. And if the person in front chooses to lay back, which she did for almost the entire 13 hour flight, then you can almost no space to move. Luckily I had an aisle seat. You can barely move to the aisle from the window seat. The food trays were flimsy and low. The seat pockets hold next to nothing. Very little food was served. And 2 hot meals for the entire flight beginning and end. And the gave a paper bag in the middle of flight with sandwich. The worst flying experience ever. This kind of airplane and flights should be prohibited by law. There should be a minimum of comfort required."

That immediately ended as soon as I boarded the B787 in Zurich. Old, worn, dirty cabin with incompetent crew.  Only got worse when boarding the B777 in Abu Dhabi for 13hrs to Melbourne with wife & myself literally on top of each other middle seats. It was too close even for married couples but would be a nightmare and not possible for strangers. Cannot believe Etihad can have this cabin on popular long haul legs.

The first leg to Abu Dhabi was with an A350, brand new plane. I must admit that Etihad livery is the best one I’ve seen. Along with on time-ish departure, unfortunately they are the only positive things I can think of. Although the plane was new, the seats are cramped, a thing that I noticed to many other airlines with new planes, and I am definitely not a tall person. They’re just pouring as many seats as possible which is very inconvenient for longer flights. Surprisingly, on the 777 plane from AUH to BKK, although was an older plane, the seats were much more comfortable, thus confirming what I mentioned above. The food onboard was just average, it lacks presentation and quality like you get on Qatar, Emirates or Turkish. IFE was just ok, not too many options to choose from. The crew was not as proactive as the other middle eastern carriers mentioned above. Together with AUH airport experience (an old and tired airport) I must admit that my first experience was not so great with Etihad and I really wanted to love them as they look so stylish (apparently only from outside). I usually fly to Asia only with Qatar and unfortunately Etihad can’t match the other carrier’s overall services, and they are on the same price range."

My return trip was scheduled on 24/09/2022. I went to Ottawa airport at 4pm to check-in for my connection trip to Toronto via Air Canada. On the check-in counter, I spent over 45 minutes as the agent was not able to find the boarding passes for the Etihad Flight from Toronto to Abu Dhabi. When I tried to clarify the reason of not being able to get the boarding passes of the second flight, the agent answered that I have consumed too much of her time and Air Canada does not have contract with Etihad Airways and I need to contact Etihad Airways as this is not their problem and Air Canada is not responsible for the remainder of the flight. I have spoken to Air Canada Duty Supervisor as well who was not able to find any solution for me. In fact, the duty supervisor answered me in a very rough way when she came to know I am flying on Etihad that they have no connections with Etihad and will not provide any assistance or feedback on my inquiry.  On the boarding gate of Air Canada flight to Toronto we came to know by 5:45pm that there is a delay for 6pm flight to Toronto by 2 hours due to technical problem in the aircraft. The flight was rescheduled for departure by 8:10pm and arrival to Toronto by 9:10 pm while Etihad flight departure to Abu Dhabi is scheduled 9:40pm. My husband contacted Etihad customer service in Abu Dhabi for a solution. He contacted Etihad Customer Service at 2:28AM Abu Dhabi Time.  During the conversation he was directed to supervisor. The supervisor confirmed that I will not be able to catch Etihad Flight and recommended rebooking on the following day 25/09/2022 same itinerary (Ottawa – Toronto on Air Canada departure 6pm arrival 7pm and Toronto – Abu Dhabi on Etihad departure 9:40pm). Hence, I asked Air Canada to cancel my check-in to allow Etihad for rebooking. I had to collect my 8 pieces checked-in luggage (which included 2 car seats) + 2 handbags and stroller and booked a taxi back home. The Supervisor informed my husband during the call that there is a Transfer desk in Toronto Airport where I will find upon my landing to print for me Etihad boarding passes. Unfortunately, this information is not correct. On the second day, I booked a taxi again and reached Ottawa Airport at 4pm and checked in on Air Canada Counter. They were also not able to issue my boarding pass for Etihad flight due to absence of contract with Etihad. On the boarding gate, I was again informed that Air Canada flight got delayed and will depart 7:40pm instead of 6pm. The reason provided by Air Canada is “No Aircraft”. Air Canada took off 7:59pm and reached Toronto Airport around 8:50pm. However, I had to stay in the aircraft for around 25 minutes as there is no facility in Toronto Airport to receive the aircraft for the gate."

Refreshments are not very forthcoming and I had to keep asking for water, which when it arrived was half a paper cup. Food was disappointing.

My economy space ticket cost Can$3100 but on my return flight I was given a regular economy boarding pass and told I would be given an economy space seat only to be told on board the flight that there were no more economy space seats. Once we landed in Canada my legs were so swollen I could barely walk. I’ve called Etihad customer service and was told a manager would call me to sort out the problem.

This was one of the dirtiest and least attractive airline lounges I’ve ever been in. We left within minutes of arriving. 2) Many of Etihad’s online systems both app and online - just don’t function correctly. It was not possible to manage any part of my booking online or via the app. Not possible to choose seats or check-in. 3) While the plane is beautiful, scratch and you’ll discover that beauty is only skin deep. Many of the new plane’s innovations do no function properly. Outlets don’t work, the silly built-in phone charger didn’t work, the entertainment controller was extremely unresponsive and didn't work effectively. Seat was not comfortable compared to other business class seats. 4) The bathrooms were not clean and did not function well. 5) Worst of all on this flight was the service. While the flight attendants were nice enough, they didn’t provide some of the basic service I'd expect even if flying economy. Glasses and water bottles were never collected, my empty coffee mug sat on my tray for almost an hour and no one ever thought to ask if I wanted a refill. 6) The cabin was kept ridiculously warm making it impossible to sleep. 12 hour flight without a minute of sleep.

T Barten",,2nd March 2023,Business,Economy Class,Abu Dhabi to Munich,March 2023,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,,1,no,1,"  The airline changed my flight schedule on the way to Abu Dhabi, without notification. This way I didn't know that my time to change flights in Munich was shortened by 20 minutes, which meant that the new boarding time in Munich was before my arrival time from my first leg. Had I known, I would not have checked in my bag. Of course my bag did not make it, so I had to survive 2 full working days in business meetings in Abu Dhabi with the same clothes I wore since the moment I left my house (the shops did not open before I started to work and we had a social event that I had to attend, so no way to go out and buy fresh clothes). The airline was not able to provide my bag before I left the hotel again on the second day, because they don’t deliver after 19:00 in the evening and were not quick enough to bring it before I had to check out on the second day, even though I wrote my exact times on the baggage claim. I came back to the airport and had to chase my bag, going in and out the security zone with their personnel. Once I got my bag I had to check it in again, because Etihad had zero understanding for me asking for access to a shower. They told me that I can pay myself to get access to a hotel, where I can shower and change and to then make a claim or I could use the public toilets for changing or the public shower behind security. I tried the online-claim on the first day and did not make it past the ticket number, because I booked via Lufthansa and Etihad didn't accept their ticket number. Etihad even weighed my backpack and since my medicine, laptop, mobile phone, jumper, passport, wallet and jumper already had 8 kg, I could not take any clothes to change with me to the shower.

I had high expectations, having immensely enjoyed earlier flights with Emirates and Qatar. While not a flawless experience, my flights with Etihad confirmed their reputation. The check-in experience in Bangkok was a little contentious, as the agent insisted that my tennis racket needed to travel as checked luggage. This was a new experience after fifty years of air travel. The Miracle lounges that Etihad uses at BKK are satisfactory but unexceptional. I would say the same for the Etihad lounge in Abu Dhabi. The cabin was neat and clean, the seats comfortable, and the amenity kit full of useful and aromatic products. Pre-departure champagne (or a Bellini ) was served in a flute, and the cabin crew out of Bangkok were warm and welcoming. The crew from Abu Dhabi to Milan were somewhat more subdued, but given the 02:45 departure time, so was I. I want to particularly commend the purser on my flight EY 407 from BKK. She was helpful, kind, and engaging and her efforts moved this experience into one of my most positively memorable flights. The mechanics of the flights - departure, arrival, luggage delivery, etc. were all on punctual."

The luggage allowance of 30kg for discount economy flyers proved more generous than expected as my two pieces of baggage totalled up to about 32kgs, yet the gate agent still didn't raise any issues or charge me any additional luggage fees. As expected the 777s within Etihad's fleet are somewhat dated interior wise, where since the particular aircraft (first flight in 2012 after looking up its registration) took its maiden flight it is most likely the interior has not been renovated since. This doesn't prevent the crew from still delivering on a somewhat pleasant 14 hour flight tho, with 2 full meals and snacks in between. The only downside is the lack of a self-service snack bar in the galley of the aircraft, which made finding a quick bite, or even trying to grab some water after sleeping particularly difficult. With all that in mind and considering the relatively affordable price point, makes the flight still one worth recommending."

The plane for this leg for archaic with narrow seats, horrible leg space, and a tiny entertainment screen. The TV froze 1 minute into my 14 hour flight. I said this to the cabin crew straight away but was ignored until I asked for a 5th time almost 3 hours into the flight. In the end, they couldn't fix it, they claimed they couldn't move me as the plane was full, and offer me a $15 wifi voucher as compensation. Firstly, the wifi voucher only last 6 hours maximum, but in reality it doesn't even last that long. The staff member informed me that the data limit was low and so I couldn't watch videos on it, and this wasn't useful to me at all. The most disappointing part, however, is Etihad's indifference and poor service after the fact by refusing to do anything for me as ""they already gave me a wifi voucher as a service recovery."" Bitterly disappointing from start to finish. Do not fly with them."

The trip from Istanbul, where the Turkish people have much pride, was excellent. From Syd to Abu Dhabi, and Abu Dhabi to Athens, foul. I have always found the cabin crew to be polite, so no dramas there. The worst experience is T3 Abu Dhabi. It has got to be the worst airport I've ever had the displeasure of using. T3 is dedicated to Etihad and the facilities are so substandard. One toilet block for multiple gates with few toilets. Also downstairs so a big hassle. Then the security - you pass through the usual security, buy some water on way to gate, and then it is confiscated at the actual hate. WTF!. Then you have to sit in gate and wait with no access to water. Why not put the vending machine inside the gate? And what's the point of security if the check is disregarded and you have to be checked all over again at the gate. Only airline and airport this has ever happened to me.

They didn’t. A few days later I went on “live chat” they said log a complaint. The complaint was supposedly investigated but the response I received was inaccurate in the extreme. When I tried to follow up, I was ignored. I logged a further complaint only to be tersely told that if anything was damaged I should make an insurance claim and that the case was closed.(This took 3.5 months. A dreadful service, a dreadful response and if that had been a hot meal or drink - a particularly dreadful outcome for the passenger."

Neda Ivosevic",Boeing 787-9,18th January 2023,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Abu Dhabi to Munich,October 2022,2.0,1.0,,3.0,1.0,,2,no,2,"  The whole experience was like flying with a low cost airline. Very little space, really low level of comfort. And on top of everything useless staff. The person in front of me reclined his seat and even in such a limited space that I had it wasn't a problem for me. But it was a long flight and the person in front of me didn't put his seat back during a meal service. I asked a cabin crew member to ask him to put his seat back just that i can eat for a few minutes. She asked him to slightly slightly put his seat up and he didn't really do anything. I showed her that i can't put anything on my tray in this position (i couldn't put my tray down because the seat was too low and it was impossible to put anything between that seat and my legs) so she just had some strange look on her face like sorry but I don't care and left. So for the whole trip i wasn't be able to eat. In normal airplanes it's a must to have all seats in upright position for takeoff, landing and meal service. When the next meal was served I showed her again that I'm not able to put anything on my tray and she offered me to change my paid window seat next to my husband and go on some middle seat on the back - because she couldn't ask a customer in front of me to put his seat back for only 10 minutes."

Ali Sultan",,11th January 2023,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Muscat to London via Abu Dhabi,January 2023,3.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1,no,2,"  What a terrible experience for a ""world class airline"". It started with the stupid decision of thinking the airline actually cares about you paying money to reserve your seats in advance - they don't. We paid to reserve window seats together only to get on the plane and realize our seats were reassigned and we were given middle centre seats. Luckily, we had a member of the cabin crew who helped us sit in the front row which brings me to the friendliness of their staff but that's pretty much the only good thing about this airline. On our way back from London, we decided to pay $220 to upgrade to Premium Economy. Payment went through, got the message from my bank that the amount was debited and the confirmation page came up. All good, right? The next day when it was time for online check in, they bumped us to the back of the plane. In a panic seeing as our seats were gone and there was only one pair of seats together that was remaining, I paid another $220 to book them and got the confirmation email from the airline as well as the message from the bank. Called customer service, I had to explain it to the agent about 5 or 6 times until he understood the issue. He said he forwarded it to the refund department and they will call me in an hour. You can maybe guess whether or not they actually called. Got to the airport with our boarding passes only for the check-in employee to tell us that somehow I'm not checked in and he's unable to do it. He had to call the supervisor to override it. We had a 1h20m transit in Abu Dhabi so it was going to be tight, but of course our flight left an hour late and we arrived with only 40 mins to our next flight. Unfortunately we had to run the entire distance of the airport given the arriving flight and departing flight were on opposite ends of the airport. Finally the trip was over and we made it back to Oman safely yesterday. I woke up this morning to see a message from my bank that Etihad charged me a third time for the seats. So for an upgrade that should have cost $220, I ended up paying $660 so far. Got on the phone just now and the agent tells me ""this happens and it should come back in your account within 15 days, we'll call you then to check."" Avoid this airline and pay the extra difference on other airlines, it'll be worth not experiencing this one."

Kelsey Klaver",,9th January 2023,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Abu Dhabi,December 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1,no,1,"  I recently flew to Abu Dhabi to compete in the World Triathlon Finals with my $7000 triathlon bicycle and gear in a separate bike box. Etihad lost my bicycle box in two airports: Frankfurt and Abu Dhabi. My bike & gear arrived 5 days late so I couldn't use it for the race. This ruined my opportunity to successfully compete for Team Canada at the World Triathlon Championships that I qualified and trained years for. This was devastating for me, as it would be for any athlete. I had to go to the airport in Abu Dhabi to find my bike box - I wasn't given any notification from Etihad staff that it was on the plane or that it had arrived. Etihad staff walked me all around the airport, bringing me to random corners to ask if different boxes looked like my bike. Anyone could have walked out with my bike if they had left it in the hallways they showed me. When I filed a complaint, Etihad offered me $50 US for the inconvenience, but their webpage was broken so I couldn't get the money. When I emailed their staff for help to receive the funds, their baggage assistance staff closed my customer complaint account! So I received no compensation for the delayed bike box and the huge stress this caused me. Secondly, the Etihad staff at the Frankfurt gate at first told me I missed my flight even though the plane was sitting there. They finally let me on after 20min of talking amongst themselves. When I walked on to the plane, someone was in my seat. I stood in the plane for about 15min while Etihad staff unsuccessfully addressed the man in my seat who wouldn't budge. So I had to sit in his seat in order to sit somewhere. I would highly recommend never flying with Etihad - the incompetence and unhelpfulness of the baggage, airport, airline, and customer complaint staff was absolutely astounding."

K Gan",,7th January 2023,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Singapore via Abu Dhabi,November 2022,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  One of my worst encounters with an airline. I found 2 damaged luggage after taking Etihad Airways flights from Paris to Abu Dhabi to Singapore on 30 Nov 2022. Since then, it has been a nightmare filing my claim with them. You will understand when you go through the entire process on their website. It has been more than 5 weeks, I really don't understand why they make it so difficult for their customers, as if to discourage us from doing so. There is no sense of customer service at all. To my horror, the baggage claim officer wrote to say he has closed my case, even after I have provided all the photos and forms. Etihad Airways can keep the measly compensation offer of US$100. I am sharing this unfortunate incident with other travelers so they won't go through the same painful experience as me. You may want to avoid this airline. Otherwise buy lots of insurance to protect yourself beforehand!"

Boarding process at Brussels Airport was extremely disorganised as no one paid attention to the boarding announcements as it was a full flight. The flight was not peaceful at all, as most children kept screaming and crying on the flight and I couldn't get any sleep at all. My tray table was broken, they never served any good food on the flight, it felt like a low cost carrier like Scoot, AirAsia, others. Etihad Airways has atrocious service, rude flight attendants, poor communication, not impressed. Lots of room for improvement!"

Business class service similar to that of a public tram. Flight attendants outright rude, haven’t seen this attitude even in Economy. No bed linen or turndown service, as different from Emirates/Turkish business class. Coffee machine not working, for which I haven’t received even an apology. Air Dhabi airport is a joke compared to Dubai, Istanbul or Singapore, not fit for a decent layover. Business lounges packed with crying babies and dirty pampers. Literally every sit packed, people playing videos and TikTok’s on high volume. Staff chit chatting all flight with each other instead of serving customers. Not once has anyone asked whether everything was fine or I needed anything. The chitchat was so loud I had trouble sleeping. I had to ask the staff to keep it quiet, a request that they completely ignored, all for the 3500€ ticket price! As if this wasn’t enough, the “epitome” of the flight was at the end. The business class toilet was occupied for a long time, when the door opened, a flight attendant came out. I rushed in to brush my teeth and discovered a think air of electronic cigarette smoke (you cannot confuse this smell with anything!). So apart from customer negligence, poor service and low value for the money, this airline’s own employees are breaking the law and international flight regulations. "

I Martynov",,29th December 2022,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Moscow via Abu-Dhabi,December 2022,4.0,1.0,,,1.0,,1,no,1,"  The first flight from Moscow to Bangkok was ok, but the service on the plane, the food and the general condition of the plane did not match the cost of the flight. I encountered a rather nasty attitude from the flight attendants when I asked about food options, got the answer ""we are not a restaurant"". The airport in Abu Dhabi is very inconvenient, outdated and stuffy, it is difficult to deal with transfers. But the most unpleasant thing happened during the return flight. Due to connection problems, I was 10 minutes late for check-in, so I called the office to warn and ask to wait. Absolutely all the airlines that I flew before agreed to help, even if I was late for 20 minutes. As a result, I faced not only a refusal to help, but also received boorish claims in my address that I was an irresponsible passenger and no one should go towards me like me. In addition to the completely unsatisfactory quality of the language of the representative of the company, she behaved very rudely towards me. I may be irresponsible, but I think that a major airline has no right to treat their customers like this. Especially for the price Etihad charges for their services. If you don't want to assist your clients, at least do it politely. I came to the check-in desk exactly 6 minutes late, the airline staff were no longer there. If you do not want to experience such an attitude towards yourself, I recommend choosing another airline, since now there is a large choice, even among Arab airlines. The service, food and aircraft condition of Etihad is also the worst of Arab airlines."

The worst person was the duty manager who even mocked at my wife who was a wheelchair patient. The lounge was outsourced as well and was a pathetic dump. Luckily I had a priority pass and could use other lounges. Boarding started on time and the flight was packed in every seta. The plane was dated but the service was overall very good by the Etihad crew. IFE was not bad and the food quality was very nice.

When I looked at my boarding card I’d been given different seats to the ones I’d pre booked. I was very unhappy with this confusion and it would definitely put me off booking with Etihad again. Please see below. What’s worse is no one from the airline cares at all that they’ve stolen my money. No one has replied to the 6 emails I’ve sent. It’s £45 !

After spending several hours in the plane, the flight was finally cancelled and at 3AM they told us to look for a hotel ourselves, something we did. The next day we went to the Etihad desk at Melbourne airport and they told us that we will get reimbursed for our hotel expenses (two tickets stayed in one room). They told us to submit the papers through their website. One the 12th we flew to Greece with Emirates and arrived on the 13th. I have been trying to find the forms and the site to submit the necessary paperwork but after two days I was not able to discover anything. Today I called their customer service in Greece and in Emirate and the amazing answer they gave me is that they reimburse only hotels in Abu Dhabi! I told them this was not fair since I am not asking any compensation for the over 24-hour delay involving two passengers but only to pay for my hotel. The answer was still the same no compensation for hotels outside Abu Dhabi. Conclusion: Etihad lied to me in Melbourne about hotel compensation. They did absolutely nothing for the long delay. While waiting in the airplane for several hours they offered us water and some salty pretzels. Completely unacceptable."

Food was extremely good: the menu is not that extensive but the quality of every dish is very high. You can order anything from the onboard menu, at any time. Pajamas provided are designed by a local Emirati brand A Friend Of Mine: drawing inspiration from traditional Emirati dress, I found these pajamas to be incredibly soft and comfortable. Amenity kit is stocked with Acqua di Parma products. In my opinion, this First class product is much better than Emirates First. Some areas of improvement: no amenities are offered in the toilet; WiFi quality and speed could be better (First passengers are given 200MB for free); champagne could be enhanced (Etihad serves Charles Heidsieck 2006, both Brut and Rosé, while Singapore Airlines, e.g., serves Krug in First). Other than that, a flight close to perfection. The First Class Lounge & SPA at Abu Dhabi airport is beautifully designed and worth spending at least 2 hours."

On July 31st i had a flight from Incheon, South Korea to Istanbul. After I received my baggage it was dented and cracked in some places and I got a report that it was unrepairable. I contacted the airlines about the issue but they refused to cover the damage and closed the case right away. I don't recommend anyone to fly with this company. "

After months of chasing them to say the website is showing an error (invalid PNR - even though ticket was issued and confirmed), they completely ignored my emails, made me run around, kept buying time, eventually telling me I had to book after I completed my first leg (which I did). and when I arrived at the airport and said I have been trying for months, they acknowledged that I had in fact talked to them but still proceeded to refuse me a hotel. I had to end up paying from my pocket and all this time that I spent chasing them up was completely wasted. I asked if there is an office or desk in the airport where I can lodge a complaint, they said there's none! Terrible service, will not fly with them again."

At first the flight was delayed slightly, according to the captain to wait on a couple of last minute passengers, which I understand. 15 minutes later, he announced again that we were going to be a little more due to some cargo taking longer than usual to load. When we finally took off, it was a little over an hour after the initial flight time. Once we were in the air, i decided to plug in the earphones provided to watch a movie but the plug wasn't working properly so i plugged in my double adapter to use my own headphones. Once again, it didn't work properly, I could barely hear anything and when there was sound it was distorted, and the contrast on the screen even after adjustment was horrible to the point where i gave up and opened my tablet instead. About 4 hours before landing breakfast was being served, and I was asked what i would like to drink and i said orange juice. When the stewardess was putting the tray down, she knocked over the cup of juice all over my lap which ended up running down my leg, into my socks and shoes. She finished serving breakfast and 15 minutes later she came to me with wet wipes after i had already cleaned up all the mess. After waiting about half hour without anyone coming to see if i needed anything, i kept ringing my bell for someone to come, only for that light to keep getting put out. When someone finally did come and i explained my situation, he responded with ""What do you want me to do about it?"". Not only did no one offer to look for a change of pants, but wasn't even offered to be moved to another seat, or even just putting a towel or something over the seat so i didn't have to sit on an orange juiced soaked seat. This was the worst flight experience I have had with any airline.  Our flight home back to Melbourne is with Etihad and we hope that that trip is a better experience that the initial one. In our minds, we thought that Etihad had a decent level of standards compared to some other airlines, but our experience showed otherwise, and perhaps our flight home can make up for the bad experience that we had."

Etihad has no respect for us customers. Go elsewhere, there are much better airlines out there."

I reached Chicago, ORD on 03 Aug with a delay of around 3 hrs. But none of the 3 checked-in baggage arrived. We were given a contact number for Etihad baggage at ORD. No one responds to this number & it always goes to a voice mail. Most of the passenger did not receive their check-in baggage as there was a last minute flight change. They made me check-in my cabin baggage and now not responding at all through email or phone. We raised a Claim for delayed baggage & observed that the claim status is still not updated in the portal. It remains as ""TRACING CONTINUES. PLEASE CHECK BACK LATER"". No news about the baggage status for 7 days & I finally got an email that they are sending all 3 bags to Charlotte airport as my location is Charlotte. But I got only 2 bags delivered through American Airlines. When verified with American Airlines customer care, they updated that only 2 baggage came through this flight. The other baggage was not loaded in this flight. Also both the bags that were delivered through AA flight are severely damaged and broken. No update from Etihad Baggage team or the Chicago baggage handling team on the missing bag for 13 days as on 16 Aug 2022.  The service from Etihad baggage team is totally unacceptable and causing too much of stress due undue delay in baggage delivery, multiple follow-ups with no response, multiple visits to airport, additional efforts from our side with no certainty in timelines."

I have explained it to at least 3 people, and the response is always, we'll get back to you. This is not a case of refunding. This is simply a case of a cancelled booking, where the money was refunded then taken again. I didn't make another booking, I didn't use the ticket and I certainly did raise a complaint and explained it in detail. What does Etihad do - nothing. They hire multiple different partners it seems, each from a different region and they are impossible to connect you with someone from actual headquarters.

Avoid this horrific company at all costs. Booked tickets to my grandmothers memorial in March in England. Come time to return from London and at the airport, the customer service assistant tells me “there might not be a seat for me”. I ask her to clarify as I have family in London and would rather stay there than in Abu Dhabi as I am alone. She doesn’t respond and I make it on the plane. Confusing woman. None the less I got on the plane and arrive in Abu Dhabi, wait at the gate for 3 hours for my connecting flight, and within the final 5 minutes they tell me I am unable to board the flight as it was over booked. The horrible man at customer service offered me a ticket TWO DAYS LATER. I vehemently denied this. Next flight was 14 hours later with a stop off to Melbourne. I’ve missed the entire day of work. You cannot be serious that a long haul flight over books. That’s just atrocious and money hungry - shame on this airline. Never before experienced such hideous, appalling customer service or lack of accountability from a company. Not a sorry in sight and all of their workers seem to act as if it is their first day - no one has a clue what they are doing. It’s the strangest experience. They gave me a voucher for a meal which could only be used at Burger King or a random Curry House which understandably doesn’t seem appealing before travelling for 14 hours. The voucher didn’t even buy a coffee. What on earth! They also gave me a $300 USD voucher for my troubles. Went in the trash straight away. Never had such a terrible experience and would NEVER recommend to anyone. Shameful and an embarrassment to their country."

I had a flight credit for a canceled flight, but their website gives me a ""card"" error every time I try to use my travel bank credit, even with the flight being cheaper than my travel bank credit balance displayed on the payment page. I called Etihad to book the flight via phone and they are charging almost $100 to book the flight over the phone as a guest service fee. I emailed them screenshots of the payment screen with my travel bank balance, and they said it is not a valid reason to waive the $100 travel bank fee. Our original flight was booked during COVID from Kuala Lumpur back to Istanbul, where we were living. They canceled the flight within 24 hours of booking, and would only issue a travel credit. They were intentionally keeping bookings open for flight routes that they were canceling to collect airfares and turn them into travel credits. Horrible customer service. Avoid at all costs. I'm choosing to sacrifice my entire travel credit over paying them some BS $100 fee to talk to someone on the phone because their website sucks."

Wasted money. 2nd flight was a night flight and crew was waking up all passengers to serve food, there should be a better way to do it. On Way back we could not start check-in bags at airport as their system failed. Main flight back from Abu Dhabi to Vienna did not serve alcohol. why? We arrived 15 minutes ahead of schedule only to be left 45 minutes without any ventilation in the plane, as crew did not agree a car to drive the passengers to airport. In general, I cannot understand why a ""premium"" airline does not want to dock the plane to the airport but wants their passengers to board/ disembark from cars in 40 degrees. Flight crew did not impress me with service."

Cabin crew constantly asking if I was fine and needed anything. The seat was so comfortable and loved the massage function and the ability to change the cushion from soft to hard giving the best seat comfort. A sensational amount of movies and TV shows to keep you awake the whole flight. Really impressed with Etihad and will fly them again.

I phoned again during the day and waited on hold so long that our transport arrived to take us to the airport for the original timed flight so we then had to wait at the airport for 6 hours (not 3). Etihad staff at the airport told us that all connecting flights would be delayed for all passengers so we would not miss our connecting flights. However we received an updated itinerary stating our connecting flight would depart 9 minutes before we were due to arrive in Abu Dhabi (even I know no one can go backwards in time).  We arrived in Abu Dhabi ahead of schedule and ran (we are 60 years old) to the connecting flight's gate showing Last Call (after pushing our way through security) to be told that our baggage had been offloaded which is impossible because our plane had only reached the arrival gate 12 minutes before and there were 400+ passengers with luggage so how could our luggage be singled out and transferred to the connecting flight's aircraft and then offloaded in 12 minutes?  We stood in line at the Departure/Arrival Transfer desk for 2 hours (I had to ask Etihad staff to bring water for the 100+ passengers waiting as it was 30+ oC in the building) and we were given a voucher for a 5 star hotel for my 60th Birthday but Etihad had not checked vacancies so after reaching the downstairs Transfer desk, we were told the 5 star hotel had no spare rooms so we waited 1 more hour to be transferred to the Ibis hotel. As our final destination did not require PCR tests, we had not been PCR tested (we had used Rapid Antigen tests at home and were COVID negative) so we had to stay in our hotel room and not use any hotel facilities. We had slept through lunch (after arriving in Abu Dhabi at 2.20am but not reaching the hotel until 7am) and had to eat a salad and fruit instead of a proper meal. I even asked for ice-cream and was told I had to pay. (We spoke to other passengers after their stay in Abu Dhabi who were not restricted from using their Hotel's restaurants and facilities. So why were we restricted to our rooms?).  Etihad (on Facebook Messenger) had told me that the hotel Concierge would have to contact Etihad to arrange transfer back to the airport 3 hours before the connecting flight but the hotel Concierge phoned many times and Etihad never answered the phone (the phone was busy or did not connect). After waiting and waiting until there was only 2.5 hours before departure I paid for 7 people to travel in taxis back to the airport.  I had been in contact with Etihad Support using Facebook Messenger and received consoling messages but absolutely zero/no action. I was told to wait and there would be action but there was no action at all."

My wife was on one side of the aisle in business class while I was beside her on the other side separated by a barrier and so couldn't help her. Incidentally, both of us are elderly in our mid 60's and she had just had a Left knee joint replacement surgery done barely 2 months ago. Before the cabin crew came to help, the cabin flight manager came and she ordered me to put the bags up for my wife without asking about our health problems. When I tried to explain, she asked to go around to the other side of the aisle to do it and walked away. I didn't have time to do it as we were about to take off but a cabin crew came and helped without any fuss. Immediately after the plane took off and started cruising, this unpleasant lady cabin manager came, introduced herself and sternly told me care of our hand luggage is our sole personal responsibility and not the duty of any of her crew to help! Despite my explaining, she was unapologetic, unhelpful and unhappy. She certainly spoiled my day and made me lose any respect for the airline. Her rudeness, unprofessional behaviour embarassed me in front of my family and the other passengers."

You cannot plan a trip with this company as the department does not give you answer for ages (btw I called either local cc in Russia and international one in UAE). The calls to support center does not give you anything because they can only verify if there is room for your pet or no. They can only write a letter to this pet department! First time I called the international department, they wrote this letter and said that the dept should answer in 24 hours but we didn't get any answer! Same story with my local department. And all the time when all this happened, I couldn't be sure in my future plans as they do not book this place for your pet. By the way, people in support center are polite and ok in terms of their professional capabilities. All in all I strongly recommend not to use this company for your flights with pets as you cannot be sure in your future plans."

Calling the call centre is useless as these people just keep saying it is not their department. So we are facing strict deadlines with complex documents to submit, but no timely feedback from Etihad. Basically no feedback at all. I had to change my flight several times because of this and I am desperate, it feels like I will never get on this flight and I have sleepless nights.

This was just a few hours from the departure of the flight to Toronto. This was on January 29th, 2022. I informed this to Etihad along with my passport and covid positive report details and was cooperative with them throughout the process. Since I could not board the flight due to being tested covid positive, I was subsequently asked to submit my passport information, report result, credit card used for the booking and the credit card statement multiple times to Etihad. I have been following up numerous times with the call centre at Etihad Refund department and all they say is wait for 45 days. It has been close to 120 days now, also their twitter help was useless as they too like the call centre employees ask me to wait for 45 days. They keep giving a random date on which the refund processing has started and ask me to wait for 45 days from that date - sometimes 45 business days, sometimes its 45 calendar days. This is just a delay tactic in the hope that I eventually give up. I have spent approximately 2300 CAD and used about 1800 CAD approximately through a travel bank. This is a large amount I paid for a one way trip but due to circumstances beyond my control I was unable to board the flight, how am I supposed to let go of such a large amount? Every time they ell me it is in processing and submitting a formal complaint on their website does not yield any results.

One could argue that it's a standard procedure, but seriously it takes you an hour to verify an ID card rightfully issued by German authorities? Another thing that always happens is delays. The amount of delays that you experience with Etihad is unimaginable. Out of around 12 flights with them, at least 11 flights were delayed by 1-2 hours. Again, this wasn't a major issue for me because I usually choose holidays or weekends when traveling so it doesn't hurt my schedule a lot. However, this one time I had a flight from Hamburg (Germany) to Abu Dhabi (United Arab Emirates) with a connecting flight in Frankfurt booked through their official website. The first flight Hamburg to Frankfurt was delayed by one hour for technical reasons. However, the second flight from Frankfurt to Abu Dhabi was on time. You guessed it right, the first flight landed as my second flight was taking off. I called them and explained the situation several times after being transferred from one operator to another and the reply I got was (We'll book you the next flight tomorrow, and fortunately for you we will not charge you). Originally, my flight was on a Sunday at 2pm, now the new flight is on Monday 2pm. I called them and explained again my situation and demanded a compensation cause I'll be missing a full working day and also would need a place to stay to wait for my next flight and the operator said that I could file a compensation claim on their website with a receipt of the hotel and would be compensated accordingly. However, when I did that I was stuck with calling Etihad back and forth for at least a month before giving up. They blamed the connecting flight airlines for the delay, and when I explained that I booked my ticket through their website and that I do not have to do with what airline‘s fault was it as long as they‘re the ones that received the money, then they should solve such an incident and compensate me on that delay. Of course I didn‘t get a single penny from them, didn‘t even get an apology and was treated as if it was my fault for not catching the flight. All in all, a really horrible company, they treat their customers as if our flights are free and we didn't pay anything, no respect, no professionalism, literally nothing. I personally would travel the world on a bike if they were the only option."

I fly Economy and have flown with any and every airline. I was lured in by a great deal on a return flight to Mumbai. The catch was an extra stopover in Manchester. My bag was left in Manchester. It did not arrive in Mumbai. I missed my connecting flight to Goa. My bag took 5 days to recover. Daily contact with Etihad from my husband and from me by phone and email. In the end, the bag arrived - no apology, no notice. The flights I took were okay. Food is okay. Service is mostly rude and uninterested. One nice cabin crew member and the man who took my lost bag details was a great help. No air corridors. Busses to terminals. Rubbish website. No customer service. I've no doubt necessity will ensure I will fly with them again but make no mistake this is a budget airline pretending to be fancy. Disappointing."

Scheduled Abu Dhabi - Dubai coaches don't turn up, and you'll be left abandoned for hours in a carpark with no information or alternative transport. -No Etihad representatives present upon arrival, desk closed.  Customer 'support' based on a drawn out system of misdirection and lies clearly designed to wear customers down and staff will claim ‘no authority’ to resolve anything. No response to submitting issues through their online system, don’t bother. Instructed by online departments to complain via phone and vice versa in an endless circle.  I was continuously promised compensation and resolutions that were later denied on several occasions. Customer support staff refuse to provide anything in writing. On the following call, (that you will have to make when they don’t call/email back as promised), they deny everything you have previously agreed.  I eventually spoke with a supervisor who told me he would personally call back within four hours, he did not, and then told his staff to pretend he had left the office when I called back, though it was clearly apparent that he was still there.  I will never be travelling with them again on principle of their total lack of morals, respect, and basic decency."

Kah Kay Au",Boeing 787,10th May 2022,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Singapore to Amsterdam via Abu Dhabi,April 2022,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,,5,yes,9,"  I flew in business class on Etihad to Amsterdam in April 2022. It was my first time flying with Etihad and it was an overnight flight with a stopover in Abu Dhabi. The first leg of the journey started off with dinner service. Etihad has a dine as you please policy in business class and I chose to have dinner immediately after take off. For starter I had the Arabic mezze and for the main I had prawn briyani. Both were tasty and full of flavour. The staff were attentive and the cabin manager introduced himself to business class passengers. The second leg of the journey departed AUH in the early hours of the morning. As it was too early to have breakfast, I requested for breakfast to be served 2 hours prior to arrival in Amsterdam. For breakfast I had the yoghurt with granola and the Arabic option. The hard product of the business class section is comfortable. The seating is arranged in a 1-2-1 configuration with even seats facing forward and odd number seats facing backwards. I chose the window seat facing forward. It had 2 windows of view. The tray table was large and heavy and provided good support. The seat was fully reclining and there was adequate space in the footwell for you to sleep straight. Do note that if you are sitting in the window seat and your seat is in the lounging position, you will need to use the pillow as an arm rest for the other arm. Storage space was adequate. Besides the overhead lockers, you have a side bin to store your accessories like cellphones etc. There was a touch screen controller from which you could select your entertainment options. The selection of Western movies was somewhat limited. The classical music channel was also limited. Wifi was available on board but it is on a paid basis but I did not avail myself of it. The amenity kit was by Acqua Parma and it contained a toothbrush, eyeshade, snood to cover your mouth and nose, and a bottle of cologne. A separate hygiene kit was provided which contained a surgical mask, hand sanitizer and wet wipes. Overall, I had a good experience on Etihad. The airfares were very reasonable considering that this is almost near the peak travel season after travel was severely impacted by the COVID19 pandemic. I would definitely fly with Etihad on business class again."

The flight had about 3-4 hours delay while at first we were told its about 30 mins to one hour! We and many other customers lost our connecting flight. And were offered next day flights. We were given a cheap food voucher with only one bottle of water or tea to choose from! In addition, they took our passports for visa processing since the hotel was outside the airport. They initially said it will take an hour or 2 but we had to wait much longer in cold uncomfortable chairs in the middle of the night to get the visa for the hotel transfer. We asked them to let us in a lounge but that was not a possibility. So we lost more than 1 day, where most of it was wasted waiting in the airport due to delay or visa preparation. I was tired, hungry, sick and without a change of cloths, i asked them for Panadol but even that was not possible, i had to buy it myself. I have never seen such a poor customer service - the staff were rude and expected us to be understanding without even proper apology. Avoid this airline if you have other options. "

The food and service on board was appalling. The food was literally inedible and they must have been short of staff because they were not to be found for most of the flight. Flying from Bangkok to Dublin via Abu Dhabi are two long flights and one would expect a better overall quality of service from a full service airline such as Etihad. With so much competition going on in the air with the various airlines it surprises me that Etihad are not better than they are. Don't even get me started on the two and a half hours in transit in Abu Dhabi.

They give you three choices after changing your flight: 1. Accept 2. Reschedule the flight. If you reschedule you will have to pay for the price difference of the new flight and pay an additional $200.00. Technically it's credit -$200.00 on a flight that they changed and you have no say whatsoever. 3. Cancel. They get all your money and you get nothing in return.

C Anthony ",,14th April 2022,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Adelaide via Abu Dhabi,April 2022,,,,,2.0,,1,no,1,"  Booked a flight from London to Adelaide, transiting through Abu Dhabi and Melbourne. A couple of days after I booked and paid for flight, they wrote to me claiming that due to Australian Government caps on 'unvaccinated' passengers, they would not allow me to board the flight. They said that I could instead fly from Abu Dhabi to Melbourne the day before. That's great geniuses, but what about the legs from London to Abu Dhabi and from Melbourne to Adelaide?  I asked Etihad this simple question twice  and twice they failed to answer. I cancelled the flight in disgust, requested a refund and rebooked with Singapore Airlines, who flew me the same day I was originally scheduled to fly. You know, the same day Etihad insisted I could not fly due to Australian government limits. When I cancelled the flight via Expedia, I was informed Etihad would be deducting a cancellation fee from the refund, even though it Etihad who cancelled my original flight and failed to provide me with a valid alternative! So now I have to pursue them for the cost of the cancellation fee. Etihad are a disgrace."

It took me 2 months of dealing with Etihad before getting to a point of writing a negative review, as I never do that. Which means I had given them many chances to fix my experience, which only got worse. I was surprised to be dealing (for over 2 months) with phone & FB representatives who gave me false promises, attitude and zero help. From guaranteeing a certain rate for extra luggage (I called to check, as the price in unavailable prior to purchasing a ticket) to ending up paying almost twice that amount (after already paying a very exaggerated amount for my one-way ticket), to poor communication and having to check the status of my complaint every week or so (which was not handled, of course, until this day), and to book a specific seat, which after getting confirmation turned out to not be available (3 different seats- same issue). I was never offered compensation, even after asking for it, and only got embarrassing answers from different people, plus promises to get a call back from a supervisor - which never happened. That is the tip of the iceberg of my experience. First and last time choosing Etihad. "

Keith OGara",,31st March 2022,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Seychelles via Abu Dhabi ,March 2022,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,,1,no,1,"  By far the worst experience I have ever had with an airline. I purchased seats for an extra $128 when I booked my flights. My return flight was changed to a day later than what I booked. All reserved seats were eliminated so I had no assigned seats. I tried to rebook the seats online but they wanted to charge me for the seats again. I called the help center and after 1:20 minutes on hold, the agent told me to purchase the seats again and then request a refund. I replied that wasn't an option and finally got the agent to reassign my seats without a charge. Fast forward a few weeks and there is another flight schedule change. All assigned seats are lost again. Online attempt to recover wants me to pay again. Another long call to customer service to get resolved. Now it is check in time. After check in I find the paid for seats have been lost and instead I am given poor seats in the rear of the plane. Two additional calls to customer service being told they cannot change my seats nor will they refund the money I paid for the seats but they can assign the correct seats for the return flights. Thirty minutes after the call I log back into their website to see if I can download my boarding passes. Surprise! The assigned seats for the return flights are now gone and I don't have any seat assigned. "

Flight booked on Etihad website from Cape Town to Dubai. Etihad cancels Cape Town leg, stating they no longer fly to Cape Town. Departure point is changed to Johannesburg, approx 1500km away. Etihad books a local flight on British Airways after numerous phone calls to an incompetent disinterested call centre. Flight cancelled again. This time Etihad refuses to re-book a local flight. I have to pay extra and book a separate flight to Johannesburg, or run the risk of losing my entire Etihad flight.  Bus journey Abu Dhabi - Dubai is uneventful (once you find them in the open parking lot). There are no proper directions from arrival to the bus area. Once you arrive there you have to stand around waiting for the bus driver to arrive, no seating area as you're in the middle of a parking lot. Return bus journey to Abu Dhabi. There is no Etihad bus station, only a parking lot behind an old shopping centre. They state in their emails that you have to be there 2 hours before the time. Their call centre's response: that's just the way it is. Then you have to wait on the street (in the Dubai climate) for the bus. How can a company treat its loyal patrons with such contempt? Etihad can - they're just too big and too rich to care."

Or you can say way below what I expected. It was so expensive for economy class. Check in no real line they check whoever come to the counter. Boarding was the same. The flight attendants they were not organized. They go back and forth for each person to serve lunch. There was no food menu. No paper or electronic. So technically you don’t know what they serve. The seats were a torture. Old uncomfortable seats.  This is my first and last experience and I don’t recommend Etihad to any traveller. On our way back we were denied boarding. They told me that We can not board because our Covid test it was 36 hours not 24 hour.  Although we are fully vaccinated. They can just simply offer to test us again before the flight and wait in the plane till the result is back as there was a testing facility at the airport that give results in 2 hours and they didn’t even mention They are very cheap and heartless individuals.

But the worse was the attitude de of the staff: rude or, in the best case, ignoring. Asking for a glass of water makes them upset. Kids running and shouting, people not wearing face masks, attendant call button pressed in for 30 minutes - they choose to ignore it.

On our return flight we had 7 kids running back and forth from economy to business for 5 continuous hours, and cabin crew did nothing. At the end the business class was full of trash on the floor. Out of 4 flights only one was decent in flight as it was during night, and minimal service is needed, but they forgot to do priority boarding for business class in Abu Dhabi. On all 4 flights no priority baggage service. Disaster, and never again!"

The flight left 1.5 hrs late, resulting in me and many other passengers missing our connecting flights in Abu Dhabi. Despite knowing that a large number of people had close connections, Etihad did not hold any flights (although they had announced they would). I waited in a mob scene at the transfer desk for 10 hrs before finally being rebooked on a flight that was not leaving Abu Dhabi for another day-and-a-half. Etihad sent me to a hotel outside of the airport and assured me someone would pick me up the following day 3 hrs before my re-scheduled flight. The promised transport never came, and I ended up having to take a cab back to the airport. When I arrived 2 days late in Muscat, my luggage was missing. Turns out it had never left Abu Dhabi. It took Etihad another 3 days to get the luggage to Muscat, by which time I had moved on to my final destination of Salalah. Etihad refused to send the luggage to me in Salalah because they do not fly there (other airlines do, but throughout this fiasco they would not consider putting either me or my luggage on a different airline). I ended up having to get a friend to pick up the luggage in Muscat and bring it to me Salalah. Worst airline ever."

The worst experience was at my Inbound journey. Let me start from the beginning On my flight from Cochin to Abu Dhabi, I had to wait for almost 1.30 Hrs. to get OK to Board. As you aware on arrival UAE visa is available for all US Green card holders. However the ground staff keep staying they need an OK to board. At last they manage to resolve that issue and I paid $100 for my additional baggage for Cochin to Charlotte. Again the flight crew experience was not good. In my Inbound travel there was a stopover of 2 days at Abu Dhabi. Due to Covid issues , I called the call center and make sure the reporting time is 3 hours prior to departure. On 6th morning I reached the departure Terminal at 6.30 AM, There was a long queue and all flights check in was done through the same counter. That looks weird to me. Usually there is a separate counter for each flight. The line was not moving so fast, so I report to your ground staff that my flight is for US, I have to do multiple immigration. The response is to stay in line At 8.00AM they called me and sent to separate counter for check in. Again in that that counter I have to wait for 15 minutes to get my turn. Check in staff verified all papers and visa Docs, then they advise me to pay $100 again for additional baggage. I told them that I already paid that money at Cochin and showed the receipt. Check in staff escalated that issue to her supervisor (that took another 15 minutes). Supervisor insist me to pay another $100 for additional baggage. Due to shortage of time, I couldn’t argue with them and agreed to pay. She sent me to another counter where I handover my US Visa credit card. He can’t process the payment in that counter due to some access issues, so he sent me back to the check in counter again. That exercise went 3 times. At the end I have to exchange the dollars in wallet to settle the payment (lost almost $15 on money exchange). At last they released me from the check in counter 45 minutes before flight departure. Literally I had to run to complete the immigration formalities. Again the flight crew experience was not good from AUH to JFK At JFK I got an announcement from Etihad staff that I can collect the luggage only at my final destination I got only 1 check in baggage at charlotte out of 2, 2nd one I got on Saturday morning (Jan 8th).

You know an airline is not good when you cannot even provide them with your feedback (I've been trying for days now). The only thing that was good about my flight with Etihad was that the food was edible and some of it was actually quite nice (although 1 meal on a 7 hour flight is stingy, especially when you see the cabin crew chowing down on leftover business class food). A few of the ground staff were very nice and the chairs are comfortable (the only major plus) but otherwise I would not recommend flying with Etihad at all."

Due to this confusion, I am not sure if the request has been processed or not? and are all the agents lying? It has been 45 days and how long I can wait?  This is the worst service I received."

Can’t change booking online, and the call center number does not work 9 times out of 10. Was charged a no show penalty of around 500$. Thing is, how to change your ticket when you can’t do it online and their call center number does not work? They also cancelled flights once with few days notice. As suggested by friends, I’ll book Emirates moving forward and fly from Dubai instead."

I rang multiple time the customer hotline and ask why i didn’t get the 30kg what it showed when i changed the booking.. the lady on the phone pretty much said i should had done a screenshot because without it she cant do nothing about it.

After booking the ticket they changed it to 40kg allowance. When I called their customer service regarding this issue, this is what I was told: Baggage allowance has been reduced to 40kg because I booked the ticket using student code. I still cannot see a word showing checked baggage allowance will be reduced to 40kg if I use the code. The terms and conditions only shows (If the selected fare for your journey already includes a checked baggage allowance of 40kg or more in Economy or 50kg or more in Business, no further additional baggage allowance will apply when using the promo code STU10.). Clearly it says it no further will added and not reduced. But they reduced my baggage allowance. Also, their customer care takes hours to answer calls. Never going to choose Etihad in future. Etihad just lost a customer who would have become their regular."

We were suppose to travel from New Zealand to UK in March 2020 but Covid hit us and Etihad cancelled the flights. They initially said we could get a credit note but then offered a full refund but I had to wait 12 months after the original departure date. In April 2021 I submitted my refund request which was accepted and they said they had made the refund to my bank account. After a few months I hadn't received my refund so I started sending emails out via their website and messenger. They took ages to respond and it seemed they just wanted to appease you, hoping you would go away. In September 2021, after numerous emails they sent me a screen shot of the bank account they sent the refund to, but it wasn't mine. I sent more emails, then in November 2021 they said they had sent my refund to the wrong bank account and won't reissue the refund until they get the money back from who ever they sent it too. Now in December 2021, over 2 years later and still no refund and now they have stopped replying to my emails. Whatever you do, don't make the same mistake I did. Yes, they may be a little cheaper but there's a reason why, if something goes wrong you will be left high and dry and Etihad do not care one bit about you."

While my previous trip is 2 years ago, I feel like Etihad has improved their Economy product recently. I flew from Munich to Abu Dhabi in the Etihad Boeing 787-9 Economy Class. Even though I am 6ft3' tall, I had enough legroom for the 6 hour flight. The cabin crew were very kind and they had trained staff that were able to give you all the necessary Covid-related information about the flight, destination and so on. Before the departure, the crew handed out a Wellness kit with a face mask and hand sanitisers. I felt the cabin was very clean, crew also paid a lot of attention that covid guidelines were followed. The seat had a big touch screen with a remote and had hundreds of movies, tv series, live tv, music and even games! They also offered inflight WI-FI, which I didn't try though. 1,5 hrs after departure, the Crew handed out the meal which was delicious and the best meal I had in  Economy Class. The cabin crew passed around to hand out beverages and had a big offering from alcoholic drinks, to soft drinks etc. Pleasantly surprised from Etihad. Will choose again for sure!"

Before going to the airport spent a half hour getting the files uploaded for Verified to Fly program. Got the email saying it was inputted. Got to airport and was told that it was not reviewed and that I had to go to the check-in but not verified line. I feel that was a waste of a half hour because they had to go over all of the same information I had inputted in the line before I got to the counter and then again at the counter. That is a lot of saying and showing the same thing. Boarding was average. Efficient. Flight left early. Flight attendants were very good and attentive. Inflight entertainment was excellent and the in seat power and communications was very good. Comfortable 12hr flight. The food was average for airplane food on an international flight I liked the mid flight sandwich the best. In Abu Dhabi the first class lounge was very nice with showers and food and drinks. The second leg of the flight went well. A bit tighter on the smaller plane but still nice service. Arrival in Male was uneventful. The return trip I did not even try to do the verified to travel and I feel that was probably a good save of my time. The boarding was a bit confusing getting on the bus but the flight left early and was very nice. I left my phone on the plane in Abu Dhabi and it was completely my fault. I realized it on the bus on the way to the terminal. As soon as I arrived at the terminal I went to the transfer desk and asked them to see if they could have someone get it from the plane. The agent was very nice and called 3 different people to try to help and he was told that no one could help and the only thing to do was fill out an online form to report it. This was 10 minutes after I walked off the plane. I was on the first bus. The cleaners were probably not even on the plane yet. I have worked for 4 different airlines and I design airports. I am well aware of exactly how much effort it takes to retrieve something off of an aircraft. Every airline is expected to get me from point A to point B safely. Most airlines will try to do it with some comfort. If you are going to try to be one of the best it is your customer service that has to stand out and this is point where Etihad failed. This cannot be the first time someone has left something on a plane. Since it had only been minutes there should have been a way to quickly retrieve it. Since I was only transiting and I had a 9 hour layover there was no reason to not be able to get it to me. There was no customs to go through since I was transiting only normal security. There should be an agent that could walk on the plane and retrieve an item quickly and but it in their normal system for lost and found. If it had been 2 hours since I had landed before reporting it the plane would have been cleaned and reset for the next destination and the item was either found or not and then the form is the best answer. 10 min is very different. The AUH hotel in the in transit is very nice and worth the cost. The final leg went well getting back home.

M Farsana",,14th September 2021,Business,Economy Class,London to Jakarta via Abu Dhabi,November 2020,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  Etihad has been the worst airline I have ever dealt with in my life. At the beginning of 2020, I purchased 2 business class return tickets that were then cancelled due to the Pandemic. After calling and trying to tirelessly get through to them, their best offer was to transfer credits into my ""travel credit bank"" to be used in the future. After using the travel credits, they told me that I was only able to get one single ticket (I originally paid for two). I was disheartened by this but understood the circumstances and agreed to it. When my flight was rebooked, the airline continuously cancelled the flight without letting me know that the flight was cancelled. I then had to make a very expensive international call to get in touch with them, where they told me that the flight has been cancelled yet again and they will get in touch with me when I was able to fly again. This never happened, I was never told that the flights had resumes (not even by email) which is when I had to once again make an expensive phone call to find out. Now attempting to rebook my flight (bear in mind I no longer needed to travel to my destination as I was attending an event that had already passed as the flights were cancelled). I made another international call where the operator was completely lost and unhelpful. She told me that I was able to stop over at Abu Dhabi and then 20 minutes later changed her mind, she was completely unaware of the system and the way the airline works and kept me on hold for a long time (again bear in mind this was an expensive international call).  They asked me for additional fees any way I wanted to book my flight. I did not even need to go anywhere I just wanted to use up these credits as it was quite a bit of money. I was then fed up with this unreasonable system and asked for a full cash refund, the operator then told me that this was not possible because I was using my airline credits, the only reason I was using these credits in the first place was that they did not allow me to apply for a refund initially. She then explained that the policy has changed (again they did not make us aware of this at all). I had to tirelessly fight her to open a case with her superiors as I have been patient enough with them however with the flight cancellations they are now holding my money against me. "

Tonino Cataldo",,14th September 2021,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to London via Abu Dhabi,September 2021,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  Disadvantaged as an Australian Prior to the COVID outbreak we had booked flights to Italy and unfortunately due to the travel ban had to postpone our flight. When we contacted Etihad they encouraged us to postpone the trip rather than cancel, using what they call 'travel bank'. At the time we were told that the travel bank was valid for a period of 2 years depending on the circumstances surrounding COVID. With the Australian government putting a travel ban on Australians since March 2020 with no information around when the borders will reopen, we have been unable to make any plans to try and arrange our travel. A few weeks back we decided to call Etihad to get information on our options, as the 2 years in which the travel bank has been valid we have not been able to make use of the credit. Etihad has communicated that regardless of the Australian travel ban that the period the travel bank is valid is still for 2 years. What I don't understand is how can I have a credit that is ticking over when I did not have the opportunity to make use of it? What is also disappointing is that we have since been informed that if an airline cancels a flight that all passengers will be reimbursed in full. The flight we had booked was cancelled due to COVID. So if we had not done the right thing and contacted Etihad for their advice we more thank likely would not be in this position and out of pocket for 2 years."

I had a wonderful vacation but the ending was poor and Etihad service was the only reason. I had paid extra for front seat and later i got an email for BID approved for upgrade. My bank account was having limits per day and it rejected the amount and the email had an option to update new bank card details. I tried to update the details and it was not getting clicked for the update of Bank Card. Inefficient website and not able to click the button and move forward.  I contacted your call center and the lady was very helpful and she had to off load my seats and requested me to contact back for the upgrade amount information. The next lady was straight forward and wont help with regards to the BID part and have me the rates. I went to website again since i already paid 69 omr per seat to check in and confirm but the seats where costing again 69 omr. Call center had no clarity in communication and my seats where lost. I thought its better to reach the Airport JFK early so that i can pay for the upgrade. I waited till the queue was open by 5:35 pm. Staff and a lady Supervisor, was informed about my problem and said we cant do anything so wait in the queue. No clear communication. I was the first and went to the staff in the counter for 45 minutes to check in. She said system problem, covid protocol issue and etc etc. in fact for each matter she was consulting her colleague sitting next to her who had taken almost 6 customers and i am still without any answer. She kept telling me system issue. I went to supervisor and said i am looking for upgrade and ready to pay. The lady supervisor thankfully listened and entered the counter and asked the staff to move. Inefficient staff and not knowing what and how to use the system. Doesn't even know how to enter the Etihad Guest No. The lady supervisor sat and looked into the system and saw i had paid for front seats. And told me she can give me 2 upgrades and third incase there is seat she will let me know at counter. Remember i am ready to pay as i was aware there were seats in Business class and my upgrade did go through due to my bank card limitations. The staff was not explaining anything and the supervisor was allowing only 2 seats. I was at the gate and the ground staff was informed about the supervisor information about available seat upgrade and they were rude especially the same staff who was checking me and another old staff by ignoring and rejecting to talk. I send my wife and daughter but they gave 2 Free upgrades to other passengers and i was denied and made to sit in economy class. The crew was helpless. I was away from my family even when i was ready to pay and they have free upgrades to people who was there friends as i saw them very close at checking counte. I was asking the staff at JFK to make sure we get the close seats from Abu Dhabi to Muscat. Even though the flight was empty. She made it in two different places.  The staff was not knowing how to check in and had all the confusions and kept on asking how to Tag the bags. Each entry in the system was done in discussion with others. Inefficiency at best.

As other customers already mentioned, they lost credibilities and totally changed as they used to be before. I've booked a ticket and paid through a bank transfer within 24 hours following their instructions. I've waited for confirmation for almost a week, but I haven't heard anything from them. I've emailed them, asked them to check the status of payment and send me confirmation. But they sent me an email saying ""in regard to your refund request,"" which I've never requested. They even didn't explain the status of my booking and why it was refund request instead of a confirmation. They don't answer our calls soon, and sometimes we have to hold for almost one hour or average about over 30 minutes. If you are lucky, you can catch a representative after holding for 7 minutes. But if any problem occurs to you, you would be suffered and frutrated for sure because they never call you back and you have to keep calling many times. After reaching a representative, they explained the reason of refund request. It was because a connected airline (their group airline) hasn't confirmed a part of my route, which should have been explained on an email before sending me a refund request. They were reluctant to do anything for me and didn't give me any alternatives saying ""Your ticket has not been issued, and we are not able to do anything for you"" even though I followed their instructions and sent them payment within their required time frame. They have not treated me as a customer since the ticket has not been issued, but they keep holding my money. The refund would take 7 to 40 days to credit to your account. I asked the representatives to let me talk to a manager, but they were still reluctant to let me get through to a manager saying ""Managers would say the same things."" I could talk to their supervisor in the end, but he or she also would not treat you as a customer unless your ticket has officially issued. "

Expedia sent me a message saying that I could use my airline credit within 12 months at the very least, if not longer, because of the pandemic. A couple of weeks ago I wanted to check the status of my airline credit. It had expired already. As opposed to Expedia, Etihad Airways decided to give me 6 months to use that credit during a time when hardly anybody can fly anywhere, much less to Australia. I wrote to Ethiad Airways directly but there are only chat robots who send you in circles, so I never heard from customer service."

These officials were rude and would not listen to a word I had to say. They perceived their notion to be true and barred me from entering the flight to Abu Dhabi. All Etihad counters were closed at the airport and the customer support agents were of no help. No agent had the right info and upon confirming with the UAE government, it was proven to me that the agents as well as staff of Etihad did not have the correct info regarding anything. Due to this mishap, I had incurred more charges to take new PCR tests, book hotels and another flight out. These were not simple things and were not hassle free. Post flight, I am on continuous calls with the service agents and I have now seen that they closed this case without actually finding a proper resolution."

In front of me was a 92-year old medical patient who needed periodic oxygen, coughed almost constantly during the flight, and had a doctor’s waiver so not required to wear a mask. He was accompanied by three caregivers who were in the aisle next to me constantly also not wearing masks. The cabin crew gave all attention to this traveling party, I felt as if I didn’t exist.

In Abu Dhabi, indirect flight through Rome was booked without my consent and without asking me. Boarding passes were printed and placed on a bench with many other boarding passes. Communication with the employees was not very pleasant and stiff. There was around a 12-hour transit that I had to endure with my two kids in an arranged hotel by Etihad. The room had only two single beds, we were three passengers. When I asked for an extra bed, they said I had to pay. I wasn’t able to complete my American immigration process because the flight that was arranged for me without my consent was not direct. This defeated the whole purpose of my original plan; I chose this flight via AUH to finish part of my immigration in AUH. I was assigned different seats then what I had initially paid extra for, in all my flights. I paid 126 USD. I arrived at IAD after a long exhausting trip with my kids and was shocked to find my luggage damaged.  I went to the office at IAD, they told me they can’t do anything and that I have to make a claim online. With all the delays included we finally arrived at our destination over 24 hours later than anticipated. I had incurred losses over $1326 USD in additional costs between expensive airport meals, and much needed supplies. These costs add up, but what really is more aching is the way that we felt like handled. The employees, rather than helping, were simply passing us along without the help that we needed. It was a series of problems, one on top of another. Not just a single failure to perform, which can be understood. We understand that mistakes happen, computer failures occur and things can’t always run as smoothly as planned. However, we don’t understand the lack of customer service that we received. We felt disregarded and unvalued. We realize many customers experienced delays and similar problems, but we still felt like things could have been handled better. "

We haven’t notified anything regarding their hotel arrangements made me suspicious and I called the customer service with around 50 mins of wait time to talk to an agent! And customer service rep then informed us that they will not provide food or accommodation even though it’s rescheduled by the airline itself with more than 24 hrs of layover. I have made 5 phone calls to Etihad customer service for multiple queries regarding the same booking with a wait time of 1hr or more each time to talk to an agent ( which is ok) but the fun part begins here.

I'm extremely dissatisfied with the service. I planned to have a extra bag when I was coming back home to USA. When I tried to Check in online three times using different credit cards but No success. The system was asking for a Code that I never received. I called my credit card Capital one to inquire and they have no record of Etihad trying to buy the extra bag online. So Etihad Airways never communicated with my credit card companies. My payment was not processed by Etihad. I was not able to check in online. The fee for one extra bag was $157.00  There was no information about the extra payment on the airport. There was no information on the website about extra payment at the airport. This information was not shared with me on any email either. Not knowing that I would pay extra at the airport. I went to airport and when I checked in my extra bag, it costs me $274, which was almost double the price $157.  I was not informed at the website that I would be paying extra at the airport. Etihad refused to refund extra 100 plus dollars"

On counter they asked me for extra money as my luggage came out 25 kg, I never paid extra for few kgs weight with Emirates so it was quite shocking for me. I have to pay 110$ at Etihad counter. I will never fly with them again. In Plane for some reason I requested to change my seat and one of attendants was so rude and told me that there is a law that you cannot change your seat and you have to sit where you are."

The “supervisors“ at all times not available dealing with other guests .. clearly numerous complaints. Appears Even in Covid they want to pack an aircraft to the fullest with no spacing. One only asked for exit row and would pay to have a seat free ? Impossible. After 4 hours wasted on calls and further time on their non functioning website I just gave up and cancelled the flight. Emirates booked me in minutes and had a spaced seating plan in place. Etihad what has gone so wrong with you? I actually felt sorry for the call agents as they were nothing but apologetic and did their very best, zero leadership to support them."

There were hygiene practices in place and transferring at Abu Dhabi International was flawless and efficient. Onboard their 787-9 I found the seats to be firm but comfortable and the IFE system to have a large selection of movies. The on board meal and snacks were very tasty and the portion sizes were enough. I would recommend Etihad.

Insists, rudely, that I carry my four heavy bags across the terminal to be interviewed by Australian Border Force staff for an Exemption. Get the Exemption - that I didn't need. Board the plane. I'm a Platinum Frequent Flyer. Not recognised. Not even a ""Welcome on board"". During the flight ask for my Complimentary WiFi. No-one knows anything about it. Flight Director has no vouchers. Served cold scrambled eggs and a cold cappuccino. There are 4 people in Business, 10 in Economy. I've paid an extra €810 to be upgraded to Business on this leg. Once home., few days later notice, once again, they haven't credited me the miles for the SYD-ABU DHABI leg. Write to them. They add the missing miles. I get a lousy 750 miles extra for upgrading to Business. I've sent three emails complaining about my treatment at Sydney, cold food onboard, no wifi, missing miles. No one has got back to me. They don't care. No wonder they are losing money hand over fist if this is they way they treat their Platinum guests. Had enough. Changing airlines."

My flight was rescheduled and also on the day of boarding I wasn't allowed to board the flight stating that I am Indian citizen. Etihad didn't even feel responsible to inform the flyer beforehand whether they can board on the flight or not. And also i had confirmed with the Airline call center, who told, I can board the flight. I had booked hotel at the Aerotel Transit, for one day, plus my Covid test also became void they next day after flight. Also Etihad's Airport staff is very disrespectful, working as if they are not paid properly or made to over work. They pulled me out of the line and said we are not responsible for mismanagement of Airlines booking fault. Made me call the reservation to cancel ticket at the last moment. Because of them I had to pay extra $1000 to cover up their mistake to buy another ticket with another airline."

C Heale",,23rd November 2020,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Sydney via Abu Dhabi,November 2020,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  I am an Australian citizen who is desperately trying to return home from the UK. I flew with Etihad last year into London and found them pleasurable but it appears that a company's true character is revealed when the chips fall. Indeed, during this COVID pandemic, Etihad has been consistently appalling. There are a number of Facebook groups for Australians who are currently stranded overseas and it is agreed upon that Etihad is the worst airline to secure seats back. They are constantly overbooking economy and business class passengers so that the only way to be confirmed to fly with them is via first class seats. They are fully aware of the Arrival Caps in Australia and yet they continue to provide false hope to thousands of Australians only to later cancel their flights at a moment's notice (my most recent cancellation was yesterday, 8 days from my travel date, after I had already made arrangements to leave and pack up my entire life here). Their customer service is equally appalling. I was openly bawling on the phone when they said that their next available flight was TWO MONTHS LATER. They provided zero comfort, zero assurance I would make this flight, zero information about how many people had already booked so I could ascertain the likelihood of my being bumped for a third time. I realise their customer support staff are not counsellors but surely they are not robots. I will never book with them again."

The only way I found out was by refreshing the itinerary in the app daily, when it just disappeared one day! We had quit our jobs and moved out of our apartments relying on this ""Confirmed"" flight with Etihad to fly from NYC to Sydney on December 3. When I called Etihad to see when the next available flight would be or to see if I would be refunded, the employee told me that I could only have a credit applied to my account for the cost of the flight to use on Etihad exclusively within 12 months. Seeing as we needed to get home for Christmas and that they have no available flights for the next 3 months this ""travel credit"" is seemingly useless (and they know this)."

Due to Covid-19, we were not able to embark on our flight to Dusseldorf, as it was cancelled. We had expected this, and therefore it did not come as a surprise. In order to get my tickets refunded, I called Etihad in the third week of July, and they promised me the full flight would be refunded within 40 days. I was very pleased with the quality and kindness of the helpdesk. However, I never did get the refund that I was promised, and when I tried to call Etihad from the Netherlands, I couldn't get anyone on the phone. Chatting on Facebook and sending an e-mail also did not work. I really would like to get the refund, as it was paid from my own pocket and I am studying currently. Hence, even though the customer service was well set up when I called in July, I haven't been able to contact Etihad since, and I have not been contacted by them either to inform me about the refund."

Not only was the experience of flight cancellation by Etihad at a foreign airport quite awful; customer service was equally unhelpful. I was told a refund would take up to two months yet here I am having not heard from them at all. It should be noted that they initially attempted to give everyone vouchers valid for about 6 months instead of money paid for cancelled flights (illegal). Unfortunately have had to go the charge back route to obtain money owed for no service provided and my bank has advised they are disputing this - under what grounds I am unclear. Even budget carriers have treated their customers with more respect at this time. Avoid."

Wayne Smith",,26th August 2020,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to London via Abu Dhabi,March 2020,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,,1,no,2,"  Etihad has shown no customer service on our flights, during the cancellation period and responding to our complaint. Budget airlines take much better care of their customers than Etihad and that’s fact. They apologise only for the impact of covid 19, but not for the awful treatment during our outbound flight (pre covid 19) and what happened following the cancelled flight and the subsequent lack of response from Etihad until we used a complaint  website. But they have still decided to close our complaint with no apology, no explanation and no refund that we requested on 15 Apr 20. Etihad had a Duty of Care for its guests. Covid 19 was out of their control but that doesn’t allow them to just leave passengers stranded in a foreign country without, food, accommodation, money and no way of getting back to their home country. Sleeping on the airport floor, stressed and upset and not knowing how we will get home. No Etihad staff available for help we were just left there to sort it ourselves. We managed to get a flight back to the UK 5 days later and paid silly money. Etihad have not apologised or explained why they did not help or assist stranded passengers following the cancellation. We just cannot believe that an airline like Etihad would treat its customers so poorly. No explanation or apology. It has taken 17 e-mails and phone calls to their CEO and 3 other executives, Customer Services, Feedback Team and Etihad Guest to get a 1 line response – “COVID 19” and the case has been closed. The flight was cancelled due to COVID-19 which we understand is out of their control, however, this doesn’t give Etihad the green light to abandon their passengers.  Requested our flight refund on 15 Apr and have not received a penny as at 24 Aug 20. Rude and unhelpful staff on the outbound flight. Cancelled returned flight 1.5 hours prior to take off. Finally offered us $60 bonus credit and 2,500 Etihad Guest miles but our refund had to be a credit note. Why would we want to fly with an airline that treats their customers so badly? Our additional expenses reached £1,500 and we are still struggling to pay this off. The one-way flight for 2 home was £1188 and Etihad offers us a refund of £304, which we are still waiting for. We bought and paid for 2 return flights to Bangkok and that’s what we should be given!"

The food and service in this lounge is fantastic. However I have had a food mix up once where I didn't eat for fourteen hours and they had no back up plan. On the negative side I am still trying to get a refund back after fifteen weeks. Their website refers to refunds in 45 days but because I booked through a travel agent they wont help me directly. They can't give me any information and keep referring me back to the travel agent. Corporate Traveller is the travel agent and they tell me they have escalated this and are still waiting on Etihad. This run around and no direct answer is driving me nuts. It is not just my flight but my partners as well as I was due to get married. Etihad monitors their complaints and tell you publicly they will fix it but don't do anything ""Etihad does not hold monies for any third party reservations"". They tell you to ask the travel agent to contact their Etihad sales representative etc. Would prefer a quick conference call with the travel agent and Etihad to fix this. I will continue to review them on as many different websites as possible to warn other travelers that may expect to get a refund, 15 weeks is a bit much and still counting for a refund."

We were explained this was due to sanitization of the kitchen but only onboard. Our special meal was a bit disappointing and small and combined with not being able to order more was a bit of an inconvenience. Knowing this, I would have eaten more in the lounge and then slept through the flight instead FAs were reasonably attentive but you had to ask if you wanted another drink; there were not so many rounds of asking the passengers if they needed anything. The seat was as good as it gets - the best aircraft Etihad has to offer. But some wear was noticeable. The cabin was half-empty. Overall you can get better service on some flights or different airlines but if prices were lower and this would be the new standard it would still be a pleasant way to travel. The baggage allowance was generous (main motivation for flying BC) and check-in smooth despite having a few kgs extra."

They broke my hard shell suitcase which I had paid $399 for, so not a cheap suitcase. We reported it to Customer Service at the airport in Abu Dhabi the morning after we arrived, as we arrived at approximately 1am, and were told to ‘claim online’ and no further discussion was entered into as he was on his mobile phone. The following day, leaving Abu Dhabi we reported it at the Check-in Counter. Just as bluntly we were told “claim online”. Once we were home, we contacted Customer Service, and were told “you need the luggage claim tags and the tags from your bag from that flight”. The tags required from my bag had been removed by the Check-in Counter staff upon check in to apply the new flight tags, and the old luggage claim tickets were discarded once the new luggage claim tickets were issued. It was never mentioned that we should keep them to make a claim. They have refused to take responsibility for their actions, and cut us off completely saying try your Travel Insurance. Also, flying with them means uncertainty. Every single flight we had with Etihad did not leave at the specified time. Before we even got to the airport nearly every flight had been changed, several times and they were usually late departing anyway. They do not care about their customers and obviously do not take any responsibility for their careless treatment of luggage. Insulting their passengers and avoiding their responsibility is their speciality.  This has been ongoing now for over 5 months, still with no resolution. They state that because we have no tags, they are not paying for the damage their staff caused. We keep getting shoved all over the place, and NOBODY is willing to help to solve this. "

Following 12 phone calls, 9 emails and 26 weeks, I still do not have a refund.

Which my wife’s and I paid for. The amount was for $8,171.60. Paid into our daughter’s bank account. This amount is different to what I was told back on the 11th March. No explanation to as to why the difference. I have had numerous communications with Etihad. Every time, our, refund claim was recognised and confirmed. Every time they used delaying tactics and lies. The last communication was on the 14th April confirming our refund would take a further 28 days to arrive. It is now the 20th of May 2020. "

J Kamandran",,15th May 2020,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Chennai via Abu Dhabi,May 2020,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  My flights from New York to Chennai via Abu Dhabi was cancelled by Etihad Airways. Except for the cancellation message which gave details of miles, credits (which is of no use for me as I don't have a option to travel in future) nothing was specified about refund. Their contact centres too couldn't be contacted in real sense. Only recorded message. Finally I got them in my Twitter  and they immediately messaged to come into a Direct Message. But I learnt that they were keen on charging me for their cancellation which shows their cheap profiteering attitude & unjust trade practices. As per standard fare rules they can charge a customer if the Customer cancels ticket. But they argue that since I agreed to the terms & conditions I should pay for the cancellation of flight though it was done by Etihad Airways which sounds absurd.  Cheap profiteering attitude at times of pandemic. "

Last month Etihad cancelled my return flights to Europe. I was very surprised to be told I would only be given a credit voucher, not a refund. Etihad Conditions of Carriage state clearly at 10.2 Involuntary Refunds that they will give you a full refund if they can't provide the service. Etihad is refunding customers from US, EU, UK. They are trying to deceive AU customers about their rights.  I will get my refund eventually, but I will never fly with Etihad ever again."

Saj Mahmood",,10th May 2020,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Madrid to Hanoi via Abu Dhabi,March 2020,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  After being given the run around by Etihad, the travel agent and PayPal, I finely decided to contact MasterCard about raising a chargeback for a cancelled flight to Hanoi. I was informed by MasterCard that under EU law, any EU airlines or flights departing from EU airports are covered for cancellations under EU law and that the airline should refund within 7 days! Obviously they are trying to hold on to the passengers money and trying to force them into accepting something else or nothing at all! MasterCard told me that they would start chargeback proceedings and that I might also be covered under section 75 credit card act (UK law) which states that any online purchases between £100-£30,000 are covered and if the merchant doesn’t reimburse them the card company is liable and they will need to pay up. Unfortunately, if you use a 3rd party such as PayPal you might not be able to benefit from this additional cover. So, although I haven’t got anything back yet it is definitely looking more promising then just listening to the travel agent, PayPal or Etihad."

M Pilar",,4th May 2020,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Melbourne to Barcelona via Abu Dhabi,May 2020,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  I bought two tickets in February 2020 on Etihad to fly back home to see our families and relatives. Due to the current situation our flights have been cancelled by them and, as many other people, we can’t go back home. After many hours on the phone and all the e-mails sent explaining our situation as international students living overseas and struggling to make ends meet at the end of the month, their response is to rebook the flights and keep the money as Etihad credits to spend within 1 year. They lied to us saying they will escalate the claim, but that never happened. Every time we called back, they didn’t have anything mentioned in our flight profile. In the flight cancelation e-mail they send to us, there’s a mention about the refund policy, saying some customers might be eligible for a full refund. So we asked for a full refund of our money. They reply with a three line e-mail, with the comment “Our response is fair. Respectfully, this case is now closed.” Their e-mails show a total lack of empathy with the customer, not caring at all about the situation or any explanation we could give. It’s totally unethical and outright immoral from Etihad to treat their customers as they do. Unfortunately, our experience with the company is the same as many other customers. Now, they force us to travel with them again, even if we don’t want to do it anymore. They force us to leave our thousands dollars in their accounts for their own benefit. This behavior is unacceptable for an international airline. We are very unhappy with the customer service and recommend not to use this airline. "

V Soro",,24th April 2020,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cairns to Milan via Abu Dhabi,April 2020,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  A few days ago I bought my flight to go back home from Cairns to Milan on the date 6th of May 2020. This morning I received their mail saying that 1 out of the 4 flights has been cancelled (the one from Abu Dhabi to Europe). So I called Ethiad to either find a different solution to go home or to get my refund. The answer was that their government has suspended all the travels to and from Abu Dhabi (so why just one flight has been cancelled and not all of them?!). Then I discovered that the same thing happened to other people weeks ago, so this means they knew already they couldn’t bring me home when they sold me the ticket, and that makes it even dodgier! Going back to the phone call with their customer service, they said there is no alternative flight at the moment cause they don’t know when they will be able to fly again. Fair enough, refund then! No. According to their policy, they don’t do a refund but just credit that I can use within 1 year. I don’t want a credit.  How can a company behave in this way? Especially during a global emergency!  How can you take advantage of poor people that are just trying to get home while stuck in another country? With the money you owe me, I could buy a new ticket with a more professional and ‘human’ company. Shame on you Etihad."

One would feel that many airlines are now under serious pressure to stay afloat be they government or private operations , and we as customers understand this as well as empathise with them and more so the impact to their employees. I had a flight booked back since Jan 2020 for may 8th, it was cancelled as I understand and naturally appreciated the update well in advance at April 16th. Being a loyal gold member for many years I am used to the limitations airlines go through. What I do not appreciate and this is not for me but for persons who have booked Base fares or sales fares is that Etihad Policy is as per your ticket if they cancel a flight it is you who suffers. They push the credit to the Etihad bank so can reuse the cash amount in the next 8 months?  But the best part is that if you decide that you don't feel that you can fly in the future they will refund you but based only on your ticket criteria and the premise that you had voluntarily cancelled (although you had not ) meaning you get 5 % to nothing just taxes back refund. This is outrageous, unethical and out right immoral. A shameful practice for any one who may not have the luxury to fly often and spend their hard earned money on annual or Bi annual ticket home to see family. Etihad I have been loyal to you but this is a new low, shame on you. As I have said it is not me as I am lucky to be able to bank the credit but other people who can not, you have taken their money with an cavalier arrogance."

Seats are old and not comfortable. I am 6'2"" and I wasn't able to extend my legs more than 70% because there wasn't enough space to lay completely flat. Food is max premium economy but not more. If you ever flew with Qatar Airways, then you know what I mean. One meal was chicken, that was so dry that I had to return it! One meal was served with fish but as I don't eat fish, I asked for a different meal. Stewardess offered instead to remove the fish from my plate, which would leave me still with the fish smell! At snacks (nuts and stale cookies) for the rest of my flight! Had only 2 steak sandwiches on board and ran out after 2 hours into the flight, even though it was supposed to be available all the time. These things happened on all 4 business flights I used. The only thing constantly available was nuts and cookies (cookies were old and stale, soggy). Coffee machine was spoiled, so no latte for me on my return flight to Singapore. As I traveled there with Ethiad already, I can tell you that this is not an exception but a constant thing. Entertainment was outdated. No movies from late 2019 or 2020! Music was outdated as well. On my first flight from Singapore to Abu Dhabi, the stewardesses seemed absent and not properly trained for business class. The other flights the stewardesses were better but definitely not business class worthy. Had to change seats after takeoff because my window was loudly vibrating and the engine was super loud as well. Etihad got rid of the concierge service outside of Abu Dhabi as well. When I arrived in Germany and back at Singapore, I was completely exhausted and needed 2 days to recover. All-in-all not worth the amount of money that I paid. Going back to Qatar Airways, where I get superior service and quality food and I know that the airplanes are maintained properly and a free concierge service around the world. Sad, as this used to be a great airline until they got into financial trouble."

For me the worst part of this was the old, dated and unbelievably uncomfortable seats and configuration being used in business class. I flew with Eithad on their A380 and Boeing 787 aircraft and you literally cannot compare! I have never been so uncomfortable in a seat, having flown economy lots of times historically - it was shocking. We flew for the majority of the flight through various level of turbulence (can't be helped of course) needless to say, I felt each and every bump due to the poor quality of the seat.

Previously, I had flown on Etihad a few times to the UK and to South Africa a few years ago. Those trips  were wonderful, and the only reason I did not become a regular flyer was due to the fact that the airport was far for me. After flying Etihad Airways this time, I was appalled by its current state. The inflight entertainment was very limited, the staff were uncaring and the food was terrible. I doubt I'd travel again on it. "

Harold Walker",,2nd March 2020,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dubai to Kuwait via Abu Dhabi,February 2020,2.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,,1,no,1,"  Dubai to Kuwait via Abu Dhabi. When booking this trip, I should have been wary at the prospect of involving two different airlines and a bus. But I wasn't and dearly paid for it. The first portion of my trip from Kuwait to Dubai on Emirates was very pleasant and without incident. My return trip was anything but. The itinerary had me boarding a bus from the Etihad ""bus terminal"" in Dubai. That was to take me to the Abu Dhabi airport where I would take an Etihad Airways plane back to Kuwait. Problems began right from the beginning when the driver picked me up from my hotel. He had no idea where the bus terminal was, so I suggested he google it, which he did; however, the address listed on the Etihad website was incorrect. Hence, we were quite confused when we arrived at the destination. The driver got out of his car and asked a few people and learned where the actual address was. Once we arrived, I learned there was no proper bus terminal at all, only a podium with an Etihad sign behind it located inside a shopping center. Once at the airport check in, I learned they were charging me $96 to check in my small suitcase - something that has never happened to me with any other airline I've taken. I was too tired to argue, however, so I just paid the unexpected fee. The flight back to Kuwait offered nothing in the form of entertainment, and the skimpy sandwich and small container of water was not worthy of a world-class airline. Once back on the ground I was relieved the flight was not any longer than it had been. Moreover, I realized I had learned some important lessons about choosing airlines in the future. Above all, I will avoid Etihad Airways at all costs."

Even if it is not possible to compare economy service with a business class one, we experienced the same services and attendance where, in respect to their cabin very good. we found that the crews were deploying the same energy  in economy or in business in order to meet our expectations onboard. The entertainment system is very good and offers a lot of possibilities (inflight cameras, maps, a lot of recent movies, games, inflights chat and talks between seats, wifi etc etc). The screens in economy are large and seats recline are good for an economy class (Boeing 787 and A321). Seats in Business are the most comfortable I have experienced. The menu is very refined and very well presented. The Etihad lounge in Abu Dhabi is fabulous and beyond our expectations. We highly recommend this airline for their business class and their economy and for the attention given to the customers during the flights."

London to Sydney via Abu Dhabi in August 2019. The worst airline I have flown with, they would not move me when my seat was broken. My seat 37A was broken and would no recline, the touch screen for my seat did not work so I was unable to watch any inflight entertainment and the charge ports did not work. I told the air hostess about these issue to which said that she was aware, but it was a very full flight. We had to ask for our food as we were skipped and there was no option left which was something with cream in the mash. Refreshments came around so rarely that after having just purchased water bottles, that were taken off us before boarding, we had to ask for water to be told that they would be round soon with refreshments to then wait another hour for water was ridiculous. I got up to use the toilets closest to my seat and was told by the flight attend that I should use the one further up that had about 6/7 people queuing outside it, I asked her if I could not use the one closest as they were both unoccupied, she let out a loud sigh a moved her trolley ever so slightly so I could squeeze past. This was by far the worst plane journey I have ever experienced and am appalled that this level of service was deemed acceptable on a long hall flight. "

They use old equipment on this route. The quantity of food served is very little, compared to what was offered earlier. They are selling some snacks on board. I do not know, why they started this practice. If they have observed that, food was being wasted, they could offer second serving of bread & butter at least. The worst part is Abu Dhabi - Mumbai sector. There are no screens for IFE. You are supposed to download their app and use your own smartphone to view the programs.  Otherwise the flight was okay. The ticket cost varied two much, for my two trips. But that is another story. One more good thing is that, though I could not book my special meals, as I booked on the last day, still meal of my choice was available on the flight."

Had high hopes of good service with this carrier- totally disappointed. From the check in(Hand baggage was allowed up to 12 kgs but their staff insisted each passenger to have exact distribution of 5kgs and 7 kgs, cannot understand why the displacement of 1-2 kgs more or less in each hand carriage would make any difference, ultimately when they realized they were being overwhelmed by delays in checking in passengers they overrode the requirement. On our in bound trip I we were crammed in very tight spaces, the entertainment did not function with loose wires dangling from the remote and the system would not even function manually, went through a 12 hour flight without any music, or entertainment. We had the same problem on our return flight 15 days later, we arrived well in advance of the check in time at the counters, the staff checked us in, stating we had to pay for 2 kgs extra baggage, then checked in our baggage, issued tags for our hand baggage, but at the security checkin prior to gate entry we were put on stand by again with the same issue of weight check of our hand held luggage, we were harassed to remove weights from the two allowed pieces and redistribute it until it was exact 5kgs and 7kgs. Could not understand why all these stringent requirements even when we showed them that the hand held pieces had our medications in them. We had requested vegetarian meals throughout all our flights, but the in flight crew argued that we should have requested this requirement at the time of booking our flights."

A very harrowing experience, me and my family had Etihad Airways on my recent return from Colombo. We were to take the flight no EY267 on 21/12/19 from Colombo to Abu Dhabi and get the connecting flight the next morning from Abu Dhabi. We boarded the flight on time and it was to take off at 4.15 am. We were initially informed that the flight was delayed due local documentation issues with airport authorities. After two hours on board, once again announced delayed due documentation issues. After 3 hours on board the entire passengers were off loaded stating that there is technical hitch and the flight cannot take off. This was disappointing to us as we knew then and there that we cannot board the connecting flight to Toronto as the next Available flight was at 10.05 am next morning (Abu Dhabi time). We had no choice but to accept their offer to be put up at Shangrila Hotel in Colombo. At that time there were no sort of apology from Etihad staff for the inconvenience.  When we asked for a glass of juice we were asked to pay only water was provided. We decided to walk out of the hotel and settle in at a nearby restaurant out of our pocket. We were asked to assemble at the lobby at 5 pm to proceed to the airport to board the flight at 9.45 pm to Abu Dhabi. But to our dismay when we reached the check in counter at the airport we were advised that we had to wait until next morning (4.15 am flight) to board the flight as we were traveling to Toronto. Once again the ground staff informed us that it’s their ground staff error boarding us to airport in the wrong bus. It was most unorganized way of handling passengers who had already undergone an extensive trauma from morning. To our irritation we were booked once again that night at Gateway Hotel which was of inferior standard.  Finally we made it in the next morning on the flight to Abu Dhabi which was 24 hour detainment. We were fortunate that we made it to the connecting flight to Toronto without further hiccups. But once we boarded we found that the seats we had booked by paying extra CAD217.30 each (total CAD869.20), to be seated together, was not available. Only three seats were together and one seat was on the other row. Very disappointing. So we arrived in Toronto 24 hours late and had to adjust to time zone. I took up this with Etihad customer service and they offered $250 each as compensation that too a travel credit valid for a year, and they did say it’s final. So they are expecting me to travel again spending $1800.00 each to get their credit of $250.00 each? Absurd. Not up to the standard of known Etihad."

The service they provide has got worse and worse over the years but at this moment I am writing to complain about the experience I have just had over the past week and a half. I purchased a ticket from Melbourne to Dublin (departure 16.2) on Sat 25 Jan paying with credit card&mileage. I was unsure on the website about the pricing at the time of booking, called Etihad team who assured me to proceed to the payment page. An error message came on the screen although the team member could see everything on his side. Money deducted, mileage deducted and no ticket sent. Etihad member assured me that there was no issue and to wait 24-48 hours for confirmation. I called on Fri 31.1 to express my worries about not receiving a ticket. They told me I would have my ticket within 24-48 hours for definite, promise sun moon and stars. It is now Monday 3rd Februrary and no ticket. Etihad has just confirmed there was a system error at time of booking and they cannot issue my ticket even thought they can see my money has been debited and my mileage debited also. They are refunding my money and my mileage and I have to book another ticket. This is not what I wanted, I wanted the ticket I paid for. The prices are now more expensive as it is the week before departure. Etihad said it was their system error not to issue the ticket. Why should I have to suffer due to their systems failures, shouldn't they rectify this for me as it is not my fault. As a silver member, my family and I travel to and from Europe every year with Etihad. My wife is a gold member and my daughter a platinum, we are all in shock at this treatment, wouldn't be recommending Etihad anytime soon."

I was expecting service similar to JAL, ANA, Singapore Airlines, Delta, etc., but the seating was very cramped, service was mediocre and the food was only OK. This isn't an airline to fly in economy. It feels like a very low-end airline in the economy section. My guess is they focus on first-class and business class, but don't have an airline culture to be bothered with economy class customers. Worst seating I've experienced outside of discount airlines such as Ryanair, Frontier or Wizz Air. Seat in front of me was mere inches from me and it is uncomfortable and claustrophobic on a 12-hour flight. My second flight was worse, as the seats did not recline. They have crammed the seats in the plane so close together that the seats, literally, can not be reclined, so they've disabled the buttons. I had high expectations based on Etihad's reputation, which made the reality and second class citizen feel of the flight all the more surprising."

Our flight from Mumbai to Abu Dhabi was delayed by an hour, and my layover in AUH was for 2 hours - in which I had to complete my immigration and security and make it to my gate by boarding time. I get off the flight and there's someone standing with a board mentioning 'LAX flight passengers please assemble here.'I assembled there thinking they would make way for us in the immigration because our flight was delayed, however, there were a few passengers on the connecting flight to LAX that went ahead and didn't bother assembling. Anyway, we waited and the staff says the LAX airport has called saying that theres a pre-load problem and so only restricted passengers can board the flight. After waiting for an hour, a man comes up to us and says ""so theres a problem and only few passengers can board"" - obviously everyone is extremely angry because they had tickets for the connecting flight. All students travelling alone obviously spoke up, including me, saying that we are travelling alone and so to give us priority as that would be easier than accomodating family. The man says ""alright all those who are students give me you boarding passes"", and us thinking this is us boarding the flight had him our boarding passes merrily, after a few minutes, he returns with our boarding passes and says ""sorry you guys cant board the flight, there is no space and we will have to rebook you"", and instead lets all the families go on. Then, he randomly chooses 5 passengers out of the students and says go on and board, I was one of them and i ran to the gate - on reaching someone tells me they're calling you back up. We wait for 5 hours, until I call up one of my dad's friend that talks to them and tells him to book us a flight - after which he books us a flight to shanghai and then SFO and then San Diego. He says ""we are providing you with a 300 USD voucher"" now this voucher is something that can only be used for Etihad services. I have never been in such a situation before and i was traumatized - i was at the airport from 7 am to 2 pm trying to rebook my flight without eating. The attendants didn't even have the decency to provide us with after repeatedly promising it. Not just this, there were just 7 of us remaining that couldn't board the flight out of say 60. Who gave staff the authority to randomly select passengers to board the flight? I would never recommend Etihad airways ever again."

Last June and July 2019, I flew Etihad Airways from Jakarta to Paris via Abu Dhabi and return flight from Paris to Jakarta via Abu Dhabi. Etihad has to be the worst of any full service airlines I have flown. The seats in the Business Class is nothing special and the design is poor in my opinion. The food is getting limited due to its cost cutting and some of the food is not good as well. The entertainment is maybe the only good thing I may expect from Etihad and that is all. Abu Dhabi Airport is seriously awful and  the terminal is outdated, the toilets is limited, the security agents is rude and the lounge and other facilities from Etihad is awful. Return flight was awful. The seats is same on the A380, pretty uncomfortable and pretty small. The food for dinner had run out of everything and I got only 1 choice left when they got to my seat which I am disappointed with this. Although, I still like the way the staff talk and show respect to customers and apologize to me about the run out food. The transit in Abu Dhabi Airport was a disaster even for the return trip and the lounge of Etihad is still poor. The flight back to Jakarta on the A330 is more uncomfortable and one of my seats screen and charging pod is broken and no one will help me at all. But the food is still better than the Paris-Abu Dhabi route which they don’t run out at least. In conclusion, Etihad is no longer as a full service and more like a budget airline. This is my first and truly the last time flying with Etihad and I will never fly this airline again. Their service needs some serious fix and improvement and I cannot believe that even USA airlines and even Budget airlines are even better than Etihad. Also, the WIFI is also expensive than most major airlines as well which is another disappointment as well."

LHR - Abu Dhabi leg - There was quite a long queue at check-in at LHR but fast track security was very quick and the lounge in T4 is very pleasant with good food offerings. Boarding was efficient and the crew were friendly enough. Seat and IFE were fine and I liked the Acqua di Parma amenity bag - my only real complaint was the food service - I'd eaten in the lounge so just had a snack on board before sleeping and was expecting a proper breakfast service in the morning before arrival. In fact, nothing at all was offered, not a hot towel, not a cup of tea, nothing. If they'd explained the system better I could have ordered something for the morning before sleeping but it was too late by the time I realised. Arrived at Abu Dhabi feeling very hungry. Abu Dhabi airport is old especially T1 and the security staff, even at the fast track lane were extremely unfriendly. The lounge was OK except for scalding myself in the showers because the water was so ridiculously hot. I complained but the shower attendant was quite rude and suggested that I didn't know how to regulate the temperature! I then complained to the front desk and they were apologetic - I noticed that 5 minutes later the shower was closed and an engineer had been called! The Abu Dhabi - Jakarta leg was uneventful and the food offerings were decent. Overall, it was OK - all flights were more or less on time and the seat (same seat type on both aircraft) was comfortable enough. I got a good deal on the ticket (purchased about 6 months in advance) so I can't complain really."

The severe cost cutting which has been the strategy of the new CEO is in my view short sighted and has done sever damage to what was an excellent brand of Quality. Slashing costs to severe the Billions in losses which were in fact due to bad investments by their previous CEO and not so on the operational side. In any case having been a Etihad guest for now 11 years and being gold for many of them I have witnessed first hand the demoralised crews, the slashing of extras and a general demise. But of late (6 months) having taken 8 long haul flights in business, one can see a genuine improvement happening. The cabin crew I have always felt were exceptional to most other airlines , engaging , naturally friendly and with a can do attitude. The ground crew still need some serious investment in how to be pleasant and value customer support. Recent flights - all on time, great improvement on IFE, menus have improved, staff are very engaging and if there is an issue it is actually followed up on. My lack of faith with them is slowly being restored."

Cabin service on Kochi-Abu Dhabi and Belgrade-Zurich medicore. 2) Ground support at Abu Dhabi terrible. 3) Food lousy. 4) Outbound trip on Etihad - Zurich - Abu Dhabi cabin crew rude and unhelpful. Food lousy. Details: 1) Airline landed in Belgrade and was still taxiing. Passengers were opening overhead compartments, pulled out luggage and left on aisle, leaving door open. Many of them were standing on the aisle while the crew hardly bothered to stop them. They were busy talking to one another. Shocking behavior by cabin staff. Additional hospitality notes: None of the cabin staff could barely crack a smile - perhaps they were afraid their make up would crack up or a few teeth might fall off? 2) 1h connection at Abu Dhabi to catch flight to Belgrade. Huge queues at airport to clear security and to get to gate which was very far. No ground staff to assist getting through security. Some of us shouted for help before someone came to lead us through to the front of queue. But still we had to run (2 little kids + 2 adults) to make it to the gate (had to reach gate 41 from gate 57 or so). Imagine the plight of elderly or those with kids? 3) I ordered Asian vegetarian. Food was under-cooked, unpalatable, devoid of any thought into what was thrown in. Even a roadside shop in any Asian country will give you far better and tastier food. Simply unacceptable. 4) Outbound trip on Dec. 15 Zurich-Abu Dhabi - Cabin staff were rude! When we asked for water they took a very long time to assist. There was no smile, warmth or a sense of hospitality. Food was as bad as explained in (3) - identical food. Overall - terrible airline to fly. Unless one is interested in cheap tickets I would not fly this airline. I would also not transit through Belgrade airport. The transit desk in Belgrade (Air Serbia operates on behalf of Etihad from Belgrade-Zurich) is under trained. They could not understand that our residence card for Switzerland was equivalent of a visa and held us for over 30 minutes, until a very senior supervisor had to come and explain to them. None of the transit desk staff knew what the card meant, whereas every other major European city knows exactly what it is."

No apology was given, a ticket was thrust into my hand and they just walked off, rude and very poor customer service. Registered a complaint which was finally answered but all I received was a statement of fact that the flight was delayed so I was booked on another flight, no heartfelt apology again just poor customer service.

Also was forced to pay for visa fees at Abu Dhabi and transportation charges to city and back for delay caused by Etihad. Customer support on the phone provide incorrect information; also they ask you to go log any complaints on their website instead of attending to those themselves. Complaints logged at the website end up in a black hole - expect no response, forget about a resolution. if you miss a Etihad connecting flight at Abu Dhabi airport because your incoming Etihad flight was late, BE PREPARED TO BEAR THE EXPENSES.

The airport was really busy and took me more than 35 mns to be able to reach the check in counter. I had to repack my bag for 800 gr extra. I was threaten to pay a full kilo for about $25. I understand that we have to follow the bag allowance but for less a kilo I found it miserable to ask people to do so. I also didn't have with me any hand luggage. After boarding, one crew wanted me to move from my aisle seat to seat in a middle seat to allowed a couple to seat together. For a family with kids, I would had made it but not for adults. When I explain to her that I choose this seat explicit to use the toilets freely she just left by saying ""Never mind that is not nice"". I realize later during the flight that she was friend with the passengers. Food was less than average and my choice was not available. Could not eat the main course which was too spicy and soggy. Never mind I had my dinner before the flight. I found my suit case dented after 45 mns of waiting at the carousel. When I approached a staff he just answered me that was maybe due of high amount of luggage that they were treating daily. I didn't argue with him and just left to end this horrible trip. To conclude, customer care is a disaster and can only advise people to avoid Etihad as flights are not that cheap."

I booked a ticket for my daughter’s study related travel via Etihad website on 17th November 2019 as per her US visa issued. At the counter, we found out a new name system (first name should be listed as the last name and FNU (first name unknown) in place of first name is issued after charging additional 33.5KD (100$) and we weren’t informed about it. They said it’s shown in the website but even they could not show us where it’s mentioned when we showed them the website at check in counter. Hence we had to pay 33.5kd extra to reissue a ticket in order to include FNU (correct a mistake) which wasn’t properly informed. I took a travel ticket for her in August 2019 via Etihad and there was no such problem. This is purely a money looting business trick by Etihad and no other Airline in Kuwait doing this illogical system. She faced some trouble at Abu Dhabi US Emigration (reissued ticket name (FNU) and US visa name not matching). "

The IFE seemed to have improved as more modern films were available which was a plus point on a flight of 13hrs plus. The food choices seems to have been cut back and was a struggle to have the eat at anytime during the flight when traveling business class. The crew seemed to be very new and one of the few crews that never addressed you by your name which is common when traveling business or you are a valued frequent flyer, flight left as usual near 30mins late which needs to be improved but the flight did arrive 15mins early so kind of evens things out. All in all, just an average flight with this airline that gets you from A to B at the end of the day."

That being said, I found Etihad to be mediocre at best. At least they were fairly on time and make an effort to be. I found that the seat pitch at 30 inches meant that legroom was compromised. That extra 1 inch makes a lot of difference, and I found the offerings on competitors to be at least decent at 31-32 inches, which is perhaps more ideal for long-haul flights. I would be referring to competitors like Qatar, Emirates, Turkish, Finnair etc. They also seemed stingy with the food & beverage & snack service as others have mentioned - hence I wouldn't elaborate. What really irritated me more is that the dhow-shaped tray that the food was served on has absolutely zero purpose other than aesthetics and it kept slipping down my tray table. Super irritating. Many passengers were also irked that the IFE system (specifically the movies & TV) is turned on only after the main ascent & will be shut down before the main descent. That's an hour of IFE gone. Passengers are still able to browse through connecting flight details or view the overhead plane cameras. I travelled only with hand luggage and hence I had no problems or negative experiences with ground luggage handling. But the standard 23kg was offered. As 95% of passengers would only be passing through Abu Dhabi, it is also worthwhile to note that connecting flights are fairly seamless and security probably wouldn't take more than 10-15 mins or so. At this price point (below US$800 for a transcontinental flight) I certainly wouldn't mind flying with them again. I wouldn't be terribly excited about it though."

Just came back to Portugal a few days ago, and for the first time brought a brand new surfboard that unfortunately arrived home in a really bad state. I know that bringing such delicate items on such a long trip it’s a risk but when you want to travel with your personal items you got to trust that the people taking care of your trip will take that also serious. I’ve paid a lot for my board to fly over and I’ll probably have to pay even more to fix it. Overall the flights were  alright and pleasant but this time I’m just a little bit disappointed."

M Ward",Boeing 787-9,3rd December 2019,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Melbourne to Abu Dhabi,October 2019,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,3,yes,6,"  Melbourne to Abu Dhabi. As this flight was a code-share flight , we were unable to check in online for our flight, nor could we select our seats. Luckily our seats were in a good position on the aircraft. The check in process at Melbourne airport was slow, notwithstanding we were at the airport just under 3 hours before our flight departure time. The boarding process for the aircraft was a lot better. The economy seat on this aircraft was no better or worse than other airlines - very little leg room if you are a tall person, meaning it is almost impossible to get any sleep on long haul flights. Cabin staff were ""professional"" and obliging, if not in an overly friendly way. Flight entertainment was quite good with sufficient content to keep you entertained. The in-seat screen appeared to be bigger than the average, which was very good. The meal service was good. The standard of the food was also mostly good. The only beef I have about the meal service (and I have experienced this before on Etihad) is that the moment the seat belt sign comes on, for even minor disturbances, the meal service is suspended. The end result is that the meal service runs on forever and when you have finished your meal, the meal tray is left on your tray table for a very long time - again, mainly due to the disruptions to the service. My wife ended up getting up and taking her used tray to the flight crew's galley, who were mostly standing around chatting. On other airlines, flight service continues unless the Captain instructs flight attendant to be seated. The flight departed on time and arrived on time. Overall I would classify this flight/airline as a good average one. Nothing outstanding, but nothing terrible either."

Perfectly decent flights in both cases, had a neighbour free seat which is invaluable for long haul so was able to sleep comfortably for long periods. Food of decent quality, one issue is that the cabin crew will wake you up for meals rather than giving you the option to sleep through in the case of a night flight which would be preferable. Pricing is a major gripe for Etihad, if one wants an Economy Space seat the price varies on the type of aircraft with it costing $150 extra until day of travel where it can be as inexpensive as $50. The differential of Economy Space between Abu Dhabi and Sydney and Melbourne to Abu Dhabi was nearly 30%. Irrespective, staff were helpful and polite, flights were more or less on time without any event. Boarding process smooth and overall an enjoyable flying experience."

Etihad doesn't boast a true Premium Economy, they have Economy Space which are seats with extra legroom - sometimes with a dedicated cabin or are just bulkhead/emergency exit seats. I was provided with the seat to Abu Dhabi for free (as it was a middle seat) and paid for Abu Dhabi to Sydney. The seat on the Abu Dhabi flight was exceptionally comfortable and I was able to get some sleep even in spite of it being a middle seat. The Sydney seat being in the emergency row meant one could not sprawl out across the seats even though the neighbouring seat was vacant. For Etihad a neighbour free seat is more optimal than an emergency seat in my view. The food offering as a Gluten Free passenger is decent, one gets served first and the food is very good although the bread is a bit flavourless. I had two meals LHR-AUH and three meals AUH-SYD could not complain about any of these. Staff on board were pleasant and attentive. One gripe is that the seat belt sign seems to get left on even when there is no turbulence. It should be noted that the snack offering unlike other airlines is available for a fee between meals so if you get peckish I would advise you to bring your own. Not much of a person for AVOD so presume to be satisfactory."

When we boarded my seat felt like it was textile on a hard board underneath and an engineer was called to ""re-inflate it"". He then re set the whole business class pod and left. After 15 minutes it was clear that he had also reset the IFE system which wouldn't re start. As a result I couldn't see the pre flight safety demo video and asked the cabin crew if they could fix it. I was told for the next two hours that they were re setting it but it never was re set and after about 3 hours I was given what looked like a small Ipad mini which was impossible to watch. During all this the seat deflated again, leaving me with a seat that felt like sitting on a hard board and after a bit of poking the cabin crew said we can't fix it and gave me a couple of cushions to sit on for the remaining 4.5 hours of the flight, which of course meant that it was impossible to use the flat bed to sleep on. To cap it all, on arrival at AUH, our bags which were marked ""Priority"" because of our business class ticket, were virtually the last to come off the belt. Whilst trying to get some sort of fix done, the cabin crew made me feel that I was an annoyance to them and they would prefer to chat in the galley. It's a dreadful service for a full fare business class ticket. Book any other airline than Etihad to AUH, especially for business class"

Reserved extra legroom seat for extra £58. Denied access and told after length wait with queues building up behind me that I wasn’t fit to sit in this door seat (I am a very healthy 72 year old golf and table tennis player, keen walker, never been in hospital, full medical insurance with no conditions etc). No refund for £58 seat. Offered upgrade to business at Full ticket cost! Also food atrocious. The plane into Abu Dhabi parked well away from Terminal as no air bridge. In the Abu Dhabi heat crammed into bus. A nasty, unpleasant humiliating experience.  Etihad are cheap but as a regular long haul passenger go for the quality airlines, Cathay, BA and Emirates. Etihad is cheap for a reason- read all the other poor reviews."

On our way back from Tokyo to Belgrade via Abu Dhabi, I had to pay 10 Euro extra if I wanted to sit with my child together. I was almost the first to check-in online. In that moment, the plane was almost empty, all seats available. I perfectly understand that when you buy economy seat tickets has no right to choose seat, but it is normal to sit together with a member of your family if you buy tickets together and check-in together. I wrote a letter to Etihad before I get into the plane, soon after I paid this 10 Euro. Their replay was so humiliating. The replay was that they will have this example for future training. What training and to whom? I paid my tickets 1500 Euro, 10 Euro more or less make no difference, but to have such a stress 24h before my flight because I can not sit with my child - disappointing. Cheap way to make extra more money even if it is just 10 Euro. Of course, other people were sitting together on the plane with their family of friends with no extra payment. Even if is a problem of the system, nice apology with the letter and money back would be just nice and OK. Problems might not have happened. Nothing"

Yurii Somov",,3rd November 2019,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Singapore via Abu Dhabi,October 2019,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,,3,no,2,"  Paris to Singapore via Abu Dhabi with my wife on 26th October 2019. We came to check in desk in the airport around 8AM for bags drop-off and were told that we can’t fly cause we need a Singapore visa. We’re citizens of Ukraine and allowed a transit entry to Singapore for 96 hours in case we have further flight to 3rd country and have reservation of the hotel in Singapore. I explained the rule, provided print outs of boarding passes from Singapore to Bali that was to happen within 48 hours and a confirmation of pre-paid hotel in Singapore for 2 nights that allowed us visa-free entry to the country (following the immigration rule of Singapore). The lady at the check-in insisted that we can’t be boarded cause we need a visa. We travel a lot and I’m always well prepared and had print outs from official immigration site of Singapore stating that we’re allowed to get 96 hours transit entry visa to Singapore following the above criteria. They didn’t want to look at the prints and also refused to check the rule on the official Singapore immigration web site. She also said that if it’s true, we might be allowed a 96 hours transit visa to stay in the airport but not to enter the country. I tried to explain that visa is not required to stay in the airport but didn’t work. She called a manager who tried to get rid of us saying that we can’t go to Singapore without visa. They didn’t listen to us and didn’t even try to check our eligibility to enter Singapore.  I was 100% sure that they’re making a mistake cause I checked it many times as well as a lot of our friends visited Singapore without visa this way. So in the end I asked the manager to give a written confirmation that they rejected our boarding (I didn’t plan to lose several thousand euros because of incompetence of the staff so was planning to claim all expenses back, of course). Only after this she just shouted on us to wait and went somewhere. In about 20 minutes she came back and said that we will be boarded. No excuses, they didn’t say sorry and just said that normally we’re not allowed to enter Singapore without visa but they will make an exception for us. We arrived to Singapore and no questions from officers."

They are let down though by AD airport. 3 of my 4 flights departed or arrived from a remote gate and on 3 of the 4 occasions, there was no priority screening so all that added time. Minor inconvenience but an improvement here would be good. Being a VA platinum flyer means I can access the first-class lounge on AD which is a huge bonus. Nice and quiet."

I went back to the check in counter who told me that I have to pay $300 for the extra 3 kg or throw them, noting that if it was the case from Chicago I would pay 40-50 dollars. I refused to pay half of my ticket for that little weight, but unfortunately I had to throw some of my stuff. the Etihad employee who were standing was very rude and unprofessional acted in a way that I was begging her. I raised a complaint to Etihad, who replied that they are sorry! so I think that Etihad will be on the avoid list whenever I'm traveling."

I was expecting a four star airline but got maybe 2. The only positive thing I have to say is that the flights were generally all on time. Negatives: Seats were cramped - one Rome to Abu Dhabi leg was on an ancient 777 with a broken screen and crappy display, I could barely watch anything. My partners seat couldn't recline on the Melbourne - Abu Dhabi leg. But he big thing that stuck out to me was the lack of food and the poor quality of the food itself. We requested special meals and were starving for most of our flights.. On a 13 hour flight, we were served twice, with a small snack in between. The normal portions of food for everyone else were quite small, but our special meals were even smaller if you can believe that. Our meals consisted of some baby portion of a tomato-based dish (every single flight had a very similar tomato dish), a bread roll, margarine, and maybe a cup of fruit or a fruit bar. The snack was a wrap, and a small packet of sultanas, whilst everyone else got a wrap and a brownie. Then when they were serving drinks, I asked the flight attendant if they had soy milk for coffee/tea and she just scoffed at me, as if that was such a huge request! She made me feel like I shouldn't have even bothered asking. If they can cater special meals, they should be able to cater for people who are allergic to dairy or are lactose intolerant. but whatever. Never flying with them again. Also my brand new luggage came back so scuffed up, it was crazy."

EY16, it was ok, however they had moved the check-in desks and we were ill-informed about it. Anyway, when it came to meal time, the meals we had were barely enough.

I guess that's really the airports experience. EY288, the worlds worst experience. So, when boarding, we went right to the back. Now, there was a problem. My seat was broken. Fully broken. They said it was nothing but contacted the technical crew ""Just for our satisfaction"". They replaced the seat, I snapped a few photos. Suddenly 3 cabin crew came up and said in a threatening tone ""delete the photos."" They said it was illegal for photos to have people's faces in. That was not clearly visible. The flight took off at 12am, 55mins late. They have cramped the already cramped seats!"

This was the same tired old plane that I flew near 3 weeks prior & this route should at least have a modern plane with a much newer upgraded cabin across all classes. What was a surprise that Business class was just over a third full which meant we got served a lot more quickly with meals snacks etc., but the whole interior, old seat, IFE particular the old Blurry screen was very depressing. The seat does turn into a flat bed but it’s just so uncomfortable because it’s old & has been well used. Crew on this flight were more attentive due in part to the empty cabin & everything done was very efficient & they were always on hand to your needs. This route badly needs a new plane or at least go back to the impressive Boeing 787 as that cabin is very passenger friendly. But Etihad sadly seems to ignore passenger feedback especially the frequent flyers who are either Gold or Platinum members ... which is sad. "

Do not fall for their free stopover holiday (available only on direct bookings at a higher cost) scam. I had a confirmed Rome to Mumbai ticket with a 48 stopover holiday hotel booked in Abu Dhabi. I uploaded all documentation required for an e-visa via a link provided by Etihad. This was done with plenty of time in hand. My application was sent successfully. However when I did receive any email regarding the visa I emailed them again and this was about 14 emails in 3 days, requesting them to advise me what to do. I got a reply asking me for my 1) Type of passport and country of issue 2) My ticket copy. I provided both and asked them once again if any further details were required, The airline did not bother to reply. By this time I was frantic. It was the last leg of my 2.5 week Europe vacation. I did not have international roaming on my cell and could only reach them via email. My last email to them stated that in case the e-visa has not been issued then I should not be charged for the ""Free"" Stopover hotel (condition attached was a 100% charge for which my cc was authorised for a no show which is what I would be if I did not have a visa ). I had an onward flight back home with about 48-50 hours in Abu Dhabi (and I was ok not exiting the airport in that case). However, the check in staff at Rome FCO denied me boarding unless I showed proof of immediate onward boarding (with less than 8 hours transit between flights and it had to be on Etihad so that it reflected on their system). So I had to purchase a fresh ticket while at FCO in order to be able to board the flight from Rome. The check in crew in Rome was Alitalia and they tried to help me. They called Abu Dhabi 5 times but no one in Etihad Abu Dhabi seemed interested. The Alitalia team was as shocked as me. I barely made it to my flight from Rome to Abu dhabi with fast track immigration. No chance to use a lounge or even look at duty free or even grab a bottle of water. The aircraft was decent, the crew poorly behaved and busy chatting, the poorest meal but I ate it simply out of hunger. On arrival in Abu Dhabi, I contacted their supervisor, who was gracious and stunned at the harassment I had gone through. She offered to get me a visa within an hour however I was in no mood to visit Abu Dhabi or avail their free stopover. She then advised me to write an email stating what had transpired and that Etihad would take note. All I wanted was a refund for the fresh ticket I had to book for a sector for which I already had a ticket. She said it would be done. I used the lounge to rest and eat as I had a few hours before my next flight. I wrote Etihad emails while still at the lounge in Abu Dhabi and mind you, the email content advised by their supervisor. The response so far - we are looking into your complaint/feedback. The plane for Abu Dhabi to Mumbai seemed like it had been retrieved from a junkyard.  I will never fly Etihad again and I doubt they will issue me a refund for the ticket I was forced to buy. Highly disappointed"

I wanted to hand carry my guitar but upon check in in Manila, I was told that they cannot allow me to hand carry it. I was surprised because during my flight from Brussels to Manila, there were 2 people in my flight from Brussels to Abu Dhabi who had their guitars in the cabin, meaning, they were allowed to hand carry them. One of them even flew to Manila as well. I have expressed my worry for the risk of damage because I have not packed the guitar in a hard case since it was foreseen for hand carry, I had it in a light soft case. The ground personnel attending to me explained that there was no risk to worry about as guitars and other musical instruments are not treated like luggages but are taken separately along with the fragile objects. I trusted the Etihad personnel and check it in. At the Brussels airport luggage claim, I waited at the off size or special luggages section thinking that it must have been treated as a fragile item as promised. But to my shock, I saw my guitar along the other luggages in the carousel. From the state of the case which was torn and the guitar's machine head obviously detached even before I opened the case, I knew my guitar was not handled well contrary to the promise. I filed a complaint at the section of the luggage claim area for lost/damaged items (this section represented all the accredited airlines). The person who attended to me acknowledged the damage and asked me to fill in a form. But upon calling the personnel of Etihad, he told me that the TAG that was put in my guitar was ""a Limited liability tag"" which means Etihad will not accept any claim. This was not explained to me in the Manila check in counter. When I went to the Etihad Personnel at the departure area, I was treated like a disturbance. Adamant to file my case, I was instead told that I should have reported it at the baggage claim area. When I told them I did, they said, there was nothing they can do. The ground stewardess in Manila made a mistake, but I cannot file an official complaint through them. They are not allowed to accept the claim. I was asked to provide a feedback on their website because they do not take responsibility for what happened. "

It seems Etihad don’t see Melbourne or Australia as a modern first-world country whose flights are always fully booked and Melbourne is a major tourist destination throughout the year. so it’s a bit of an insult when they use an old plane for this route. The seat was old and uncomfortable the IFE screen is the size of what you get on a modern economy cabin and just imagine in the business class cabin of 44 seats you get one toilet. That has to be unacceptable in business class that’s always full on this route! This flight, as usual, takes off late near to 45 mins later than it’s scheduled departure and as usual arrives late. Cabin crew were attentive on this flight and I did make conversation with the cabin manager and reference to why this route has gone back to a 777. Especially an old tired out 777 at that. So disappointing. Food on this flight was average and nothing to write home about. But this whole flight was let down by the use of an old 777 plane that needs retiring when compared to the modern 787 that was used on the last 4 flights that I have taken on this route previously. Etihad needs to step up this route with a modern aircraft"

The food was bad and the the seats were dirty. We also had air con that leaked all over me and my partner and the CSM did nothing about it, even though we got drenched! We flew them to Europe and back and all 4 flights were bad! Never will I fly Etihad Airways again. I will give them a 3 out of 10 because the pilots were good."

Paid in advance some £160 to choose my seats over 3 of the 4 legs. On check in I was told that the seats I had selected and paid for were now not available, and that I had been relocated. When I asked for a refund I was told to call the helpdesk. Helpdesk informed me after 4 phone calls that even though I had paid for a service they could not deliver, there are No refunds. Complained in writing on return to UK. Etihad held their line, there are No refunds. Warning, take care if paying in advance to sit together, as Etihad will take your money, overbook the flight, and not refund you a penny when they cannot fulfill their side of the bargain. Generally the flight experience on Etihad was pretty poor. Surely and non engaging cabin crew, poor meals, no galley snacks except water, uncomfortable seats. They did take off and land within 30 minutes of expected times. I know the fares are competitive, but overall I felt fleeced."

C Allen",,11th September 2019,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Rome to Hong Kong via Abu Dhabi,August 2019,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,1,no,1," I now understand better the low reviews Etihad gets here on Skytrax. The first flight Rome - Abu Dhabi was on time, but with the usual things I have found people complaining about: small meals (not enough), advertisement shown several times during the flight, ground staff and crew not very polite nor friendly. But the worst came after. The flight Abu Dhabi - Hong Kong was delayed by ~1h, which meant missing my connection in Hong Kong. Ground staff in Hong Kong provided a lunch voucher (only after I complained and insisted for myself and fellow passengers) worth 90 HKD, which, in the restaurants that accepted it, was barely enough to get the cheapest item on the menu. Tells you already a lot about the airline policy and how much they value their customers. Had to wait several hours at the airport, ended up arriving at my final destination ~10h later than originally scheduled. When I asked for compensation through their online customer 'service' (I frown at calling it service) - after a couple of weeks they offered a 100 USD voucher through their travel bank, valid 12 months. Basically useless and disrespectful."

R Carlesa",,10th September 2019,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Rome to Hong Kong via Abu Dhabi,August 2019,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,1,no,1,"  Rome to Hong Kong via Abu Dhabi. Left Rome on time, flight was ok - same low quality in terms of food (bare minimum amount), flight attendants, advertisements shown at the beginning (everyone's screen) and during flight while watching movies. Relatively negative feeling. Then, flight departed late from Abu Dhabi, seemingly due to air traffic congestion in Abu Dhabi (Etihad's hub). Delay meant arrival in Hong Kong more than one hour late, missing my connecting flight to Osaka. Instead of arriving in Osaka at 4PM, ended up arriving later on at 2AM - no transportation, had to sleep at the airport's hotel etc etc. In Hong Kong, after my complains for myself and fellow passengers in the same situation, Etihad ground staff offered a lunch voucher worth 90 HKD - not even accepted in some of the restaurants and in those where it was, barely enough to cover the cheapest item on the menu. Tells you already a lot about the airline and how they value their customers. I then lodged a complain through their online system. And to be fair, they responded (although after 2 weeks) - offering a voucher of 100 USD through their 'travel bank' for the inconvenience. To note, valid for only 12 months. Which is essentially useless, unless you fly with them again. A bad experience, and one that made sure I will avoid flying Etihad in the future."

R Carlesa",,10th September 2019,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tokyo to Rome via Abu Dhabi,July 2019,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,1,no,3,"  Tokyo to Rome via Abu Dhabi. Etihad touts itself as a high-standard airline - in the end it feels more like a cheap low-cost carrier disguised as a fancy one. On this flight there were no major disruptions or issues, but several small things that when added up make the overall experience rather unpleasant. First of all - inflight meals are kept to a bare minimum: a single dish with a small side for dinner, and a single small dish for breakfast. Not enough, and they extensively advertise additional snacks or food to be bought aside. Quality of the food was ok. Bad image since it is obviously for cost-saving. Second, on the long-haul Tokyo - Abu Dhabi, no snacks, nothing offered except water between the evening and morning meals. Third, connecting time in Abu Dhabi. On the ticket, and on the boarding pass it indicated a ~1.5h interval - actual arrival time was ~1.5h earlier meaning a total waiting time of 3h. This feels quite a deliberate, misleading action, as customers are more likely to buy a ticket with a connecting time of 1.5h rather than 3h. With more time in the transit area, travelers are more likely to shop. Fourth, flight attendants barely smiling and polite."

I booked my gluten-free meal via phone one month before departure as I am Coeliac. I got a gluten-free meal on flight London-Abi Dhabi but didn’t get anything in the second flight Abu Dhabi- Seychelles. I complained as I didn’t have anything with me and I was starving, they gave me some raw fish for breakfast from business class which I didn’t eat. The reason why I didn’t have a gluten-free meal was unknown however I asked them to make sure that this wouldn’t happen again in my return flight and they took my details. After a week I was going back to London from Seychelles via Abu Dhabi. Guess what? Again, I didn’t get my gluten-free meal in the flight Seychelles- Abu Dhabi! I complained, even more, considering this was the 2nd time. They couldn’t even find something gluten-free from business class and I was starving after eating only a snack that I had with me, I told them that I was starving. After a couple of hours, I noticed that in the catalogue they sell gluten-free meals! Glad to know that no one told me that! I obviously had to purchase it and I asked for a refund days after. Terrible experiences, not one mistake but two mistakes. Days after I asked customer Service why this situation happened and what went wrong, they never replied. They offered me $70 travel credit voucher to use in 12 months which I refused."

There was not a spare seat on the plane which amplified the lack of space in the cabin particularly as I'd flown on a B777 in 3x3x3 configuration a couple of days previous. The aircraft was ten years old, and looked it, the decor - never that inspiring - reflecting Etihad's faded glory - use of the very basic Miracle lounge at Bangkok Airport symptomatic. No live TV either. Not all negative, though. Crew were efficient and the full-size dinner tray has re-appeared with a range of courses provided, though my vegetarian curry was poor in comparison to that served on flights from Abu Dhabi. Early arrival and de-planing through an air bridge at Terminal 1, a change from the normal cramming in a bus from the furthest flung extremity of Abu Dhabi airport."

Busy overnight flight on a near brand-new 787. No spare seats which made for a cramped environment, Etihad is not known for the generosity of its space in cattle class, as I was able to compare on later flights. Check-in and boarding fine. My gold card status was recognized by the crew, who were attentive throughout. The obligatory 45 minutes delay in departure, with the likewise obligatory blaming of air traffic control notwithstanding the banging underneath my feet which suggested something other was responsible. Not too much of a trial, water was provided and, contrary to reports elsewhere, the IFE was active though interrupted with various promotions including the 'sweet and salty' menu; far too expensive. On time arrival at KUL so clearly Etihad factor in Abu Dhabi airport's quirks in the timetable. My first (and last?) experience of the much-criticized streamline food offering. The main meal, a pre-ordered asian vegetarian; paneer & dal curry, with the welcome return of the paratha, was delicious, certainly far superior to a recent offering in Emirates' business class. Nevertheless a few other bits and bobs would have been welcome, and for such time as the tray was on the tray table, there was the overriding fear the whole lot would end up on my lap! Apart from the cabin temperature being set close to absolute zero - always carry a fleece on Etihad - the flight passed smoothly, my bag arriving on the carousel as a I cleared immigration."

Whilst I understand that these are third party providers, some measurement of service levels should be put in place, left waiting for over 25 minutes to check at Biz class check in whilst one woman argued with the agent who did not care about her over weight bags. I and other passengers asked to use the Y class check in and told no with a wave of the hand. At boarding handed my passport/ card to the agent who was to busy laughing with his colleague and dropped my passport and then demanded i pick it up - When I protested at his attitude he started being aggressive , shouting and telling me his Saudi. Unbelievably aggressive, the worst experience of any customer service I have ever experienced - I filed a complaint but with Etihad you just get a copy and paste reply, so they clearly do not care, so why should I ?

Side head rest on each seat is very helpful. Aircraft was new and cleanliness was taken care of. Swift check-in at FRA for the passengers with online boarding pass. Special meals pre-booked served well on time . Negatives : Leg room disappointed me (I am tall). Quantity of food served was not enough (bad impression if it's for cost cutting). No beverages served before dinner (along with it), I didn't like the idea. Some of the crew members were courteous while others were plain face (One was extremely rude). Overall a fairly good experience. But it always takes a little extra effort to make a flyer fly again with you, which was lacking."

Etihad asked me to pay 80USD for shipment of the item they failed to return. Even when I paid for shipment they failed to deliver it to me. Result: delivered horrible experience during the flight, took the money for shipment and lost my suit jacket. Never apologized. Never reimbursed for the lost item.  They have not responded or got in touch with me despite repeated emails.  Real shame.

The thoughtlessness of Etihad on this point is staggering. By the time ones gets out of the airport and to their final destination, it is about 1 am.

Refused the blanket they offered to place on the floor, so it could at least dry off.

Registered a complaint at the airport then itself. Next day, filed the online claim providing all the documents I had. They have completely ignored all my queries re: the status of my claim. Nothing - no updates, no apologies, no hint of any compensation for the troubles and expenses I incurred because they broke my bag and a couple of items inside it. As if that wasn't enough, on the way back to LAX, they mishandled the other bag. Damaged the extension handle (so that is unusable now), and caused a few rips on the soft-sided exterior of the suitcase. Both my bags (1 Samsonite, 1 Nautica) are of excellent quality and were in near-pristine condition despite multiple international trips on other airlines. I am not even going to waste my time registering another complaint (which is what they would want, but only if they cared for their customers).

People were asking for water, and they kept coming around when they were ready to give you some, with attitude. 4 Weeks later we are ready to come back home from our holiday. So i make contact with my travel agent, making sure we don't have the same problem as we did going. I get another email 24 hours before to check in on line, i knew there was going to have a problem here also, i checked my seating and again it only showed me at the front of the plane. and my family 30 rows back. I call Etihad and advise them of the problem, they can see my booking details and said' They will fix the problem and have it sorted"" Then i get an email from them advising me that I have only paid for 1 seat at the front of the plain with extra room and a allocated seat. I explained to the operator, i have an email confirmation from your company advising me my seats i have been allocated. never got a reply back. We went to the Airport a few hours earlier to try and fix the problem, I mentioned what happened and showed them my confirmation email and they said the same thing as the customer service person. At the end of this i asked its not my fault if he only charged me for 1 seat, when we were at the travel agency at the time of us booking our seats and asked for the total amount to be payed, we payed and we got a confirmation email. Their reply was sorry you should have contacted us earlier."" I said how much earlier when i have a confirmation"" We ended up seating separately on the return, as it was a full flight. I didn't bother eating any food, because i didn't want to get my head bitten off for asking for something extra. This was my first time flying Etihad and my last."

Greedy airline that overbooks it flights excessively (normal practice) and then lie through their teeth!  Was denied boarding because flight was overbooked, Etihad wee passing me from one person to another till the flight was closed without explaining anything. I was offered no compensation or alternative after spending at the airport 6 hours. I watched how kids and elderly people were separated from their families because the majority of the flights were overbooked and they had no duty a care, it was really sad to watch. No care for people and try to make it your problem. It is unreliable airline that has not fundamental ethics."

The ground crew and cabin crew were as friendly and attentive. The plane was old, however, the food and beverages had low quality. No fresh juices on board, the earl grey was watery. Coffees like latte, cappuccino (everything with foamed milk) were not available as the machine was not working. The lunch was partly cold and the presentation was quite cheap. Decided take a nap, I had to ask for an eyemask extra, for a toothbrush I had to ask extra, as they do not have the amenity bags anymore on short flights (4-5 hours). The wifi was available but even whatsapp could not connect. Basically, I had the wifi sign on my screen but it was not working. Fast Track 'flyer' for the passport control were not available and we were advised to show our boarding cards for the fast track. In order to summarize; the quality was extremely low with regard to the food & drinks and service."

Due to leave Sydney on 13th Feb, Aircraft went U/S due to engine problem. Delayed overnight, Hotel provided OK the food voucher was insufficient to buy Dinner and Breakfast. Arrived at airport to be told of second delay - Having questioned staff the night before this was already expected! I was told again that the flight would leave later! Pretty clear to all and sundry that this was a very sick aircraft - was eventually given seats on the 777 leaving that evening (14th, which also departed late) . Total delay of 19 hrs on departure . My routing was changed and involved a sector with no J class on a budget airline (I knew this ) but EY staff at Sydney swore blind there was a J class cabin on Flybe. The eventual late departure from Sydney gave a very short transit in AUH to the extent we had to run to get the next flight - no fun in your late 60's (No assistance from EY offered at their home base.) . Sector out of SYD to AUH J class ran out of meal choices about 4 rows into the cabin. The cabin crew found a crew meal which my wife could eat. (Kudos due and given to the staff member but not the airline). Having just made the flight my wife ordered a drink, the male cabin crew brought a totally different drink and then told my wife she was lying about her order when she told him this!  Result he avoided any service to us like the plague for the rest of the flight. So 2 sectors screwed up by Etihad - a 19 hour delay to 2 J class pax, Service in Sydney very poor, ground crew unable to manage an admittedly busy situation, Cabin service abysmal especially AUH to Amsterdam. Etihad response to my detailed complaint a 200 dollar voucher to be used on EY within 12 months all of this through a complaints procedure where they have refused to engage with me or answer the complaint. Very poor service and response to detailed and coherent complaint. Yes aircraft go tech but the responses and further disasters in service recovery were and still are wholly unacceptable."

On 12th July I was scheduled to fly back from Islamabad to Melbourne via Abu Dhabi. I tried checking in online. However, I was unable to get my boarding pass. An error “check in not possible” kept popping up. I reached Islamabad airport and I was only given a boarding pass from Islamabad to Abu Dhabi. When I asked for the boarding pass for my next flight, I was told that due to some system problem, I can’t be issued one right now and will get it from the transfer desk in Abu Dhabi. I asked the Etihad staff member whether the Abu Dhabi to Melbourne flight is fully booked/over booked. She assured me that it’s not and I have nothing to worry about. When I got to Abu Dhabi, the flight to Melbourne was indeed over booked. I landed at 7am and was scheduled to fly at 10 am. However, that flight was over booked and the next possible flight was at 9:50pm AND that too was over booked so I couldn’t be accommodated in it. There were around 10 other people in a similar situation trying to get to Melbourne but unable to due to over booked flights. I eventually accepted a flight to Melbourne via Sydney which was expected to leave at 9:45pm. I was given a hotel and meal vouchers by the airline. The hotel room I was given was basically a small cabin with a bunk bed. I was expected to share that room with a complete stranger. Apparently, there was no other room available.  I was informed by the Etihad staff that Abu Dhabi visa will at least take 6 hours so there is no point in applying. However, when they saw that I wasn’t willing to stay in that small cabin, I was issued a visa within 1.5 hours. I had to put my foot down and fight for it though.  When I accepted to take the flight via Sydney to Melbourne I was concerned about the 2 hour layover in Sydney. The lady at the flight transfer desk at Abu Dhabi assured me that I’ll have enough time to get to the next gate. She promised that my immigration will take place in Melbourne and my bags will also reach Melbourne directly. When I came to the Abu Dhabi airport again for my flight to Sydney, I rechecked about my luggage. I was then informed that I will have to go through immigration at Sydney, collect my luggage and then go through customs again to catch the flight to Melbourne. By this time, as all of you can imagine, I had had enough. I then asked for some sort of document that might help me at Sydney airport to catch the next flight (In case I miss the one they promised). The staff promised to accommodate me and give me paperwork stating the inconvenience I’ve been put through and paperwork to help me at the Sydney airport.  I was promised that a person will be waiting for me at the Sydney airport to help me skip all custom lines and reach my connecting flight as soon as possible. When I asked for some sort of documentation to show this in writing that I won’t further be tortured at Sydney airport they assured me to get onboard and they’ll provide it in the plane.  Tired and defeated I decided to board the plane. I wasn't given any letter or document as promised. Nobody helped me at Sydney airport - My luggage was lost in Abu Dhabi and i received it after 24 hours."

Our flight was delayed for over an hour while everyone had already boarded because 6 passengers had to be loaded off the plane including their checked in baggage because their seats were broken. The legroom is below average and the seats itself are very small to the point my lower back was aching extremely. The quality and quantity of food provided was horrific and if you want a snack inbetween the ridiculously infrequent and small meals (we were fed a small meal twice on a 17hr flight), you have to PAY for them... I had an upset stomach for days after and I was extremely hungry during my flights. With almost all airlines when you are flying such a long way you get a tray of food, your main meal, a little bowl of salad or fruit and a little piece of bread and/or a desert, not to mention snacks are free. With Etihad you get a small bowl of your meal and thats it. They also do not provide you with a pouch filled with necessities such as a small toothbrush or socks etc. I will never fly with Etihad again. I am not one to complain quickly, economy flights are always a little uncomfortable, but these flights was just shocking."

Because the agent told me that I don't have visa going to Jordan. But we explain to them that I'm married to a Jordanian citizen and my kids are Jordanian that's why my visa will be on arrival. We used to do that and this is not my first time travelling to Jordan. Even I showed to Eihad agent that I have my old visa on arrival stamp with my marriage contract when I visited Jordan before ,but still the agent insist that I cannot travel and cannot check in my luggage. I tried to explain to them that if we are a UAE resident your visa will be on arrival. But still the agent didn't accept me and my kids. After that we went to ticketing area to check with them about our ticket. The agent even told us that they will make our ticket open and we can pay only 350dhs per person if we find the same offer. We believe them but unfortunately they also lied to us. After the ticketing we went to Jordanian embassy and told them what happened. They said that I can have my visa on arrival in Amman. We was very shocked. Then the Jordanian embassy start process my visa to have less stress. And they are willing to give me written letter from Jordanian embassy that I'm allowed to have my visa on arrival. But when we call to book a ticket they told us that we need to pay around 9000 dhs. For me and my two kids. Its to expensive and take note we paid already our first flight for almost 5000dhs. Then we need to pay extra 9000 dhs. I think there is some mistake from agent. It's very stressful and very bad customer service.  We are not gonna pay extra 9000dhs for our ticket because it's specifically not our mistake. We went back to airport to show them the paper from Jordan embassy that I'm allowed to enter Jordan and to have my visa on arrival but what they reply to us they cannot compensate my our ticket and we lose out money.

When we went for check in I had different row seat. But was able to sit together till Abu Dhabi. When boarded the flight Etihad Airways 0246 to COK, I had the seat 3 rows behind and we requested with flight attendant to sit together. They were least helpful and said if you want to sit together request with the passenger and swap the seats and they cannot help us. I had to request the co passenger and sat together. It was worst experience we got while traveling all these years.Also even after requesting for kids meal we did not receive it. On return flight I called to make sure that we are sitting together. The customer service agent again said if you want to sit together need to pay. At Cochin airport I was able to get the seat together till Abu Dhabi and asked me to request in transfer desk in Abu Dhabi.  In the transfer desk we met some staff who were there for fun time, made me wait with my kid for 20 minutes to tell they cannot help and please request with your co passengers to sit together. They were talking and having fun while my was tired and exhausted with the travel. In flight we had a flight attended who tried hard and make sure we are able to sit near. They did their best with smile. We except only a smile and polite replies while we request. Etihad has lost all the good service and no more care about there customers. "

To top it off, my baggage was lost, but they returned it after two days. The bus service provided from Abu Dhabi to Dubai is good. It has wifi and water. You have to collect your bags at Abu Dhabi airport and then go outside the terminal to catch the bus. Overall, below average trip.

Inflight entertainment was fine, I had blocked seats in something called as economy space, so seating was comfortable. The attendants don't serve you water till they are serving the paid snacks and we all were parched, eventually one of the nicer attendants gave us a water bottle. The Abu-Dhabi to Delhi flight was worse, it was a 2.40 AM flight and I had blocked seats, however as soon as I entered the airplane and realised there is no inflight entertainment (no screens), it was as domestic one could get. Food was okayish, minimalist in quantity, seating space was like a hellhole (and I was wondering why did I block seats), attendants were ok, mostly chatting in their own language (not English) and the flight does not even get docked to the airport.

The data being added on the app is clearly not syncing with their records. After this, the crew also had the audacity say that the meals should have been selected. After this, we requested for at least fruits or some snacks because there was no veg food available but we were not provided that.

After 10mins I realized and ran back to retrieve my items from the aircraft but no one was being helpful in advising me what I can do to get my items back. After running around like mad trying to get assistant, a gentleman from Etihad advised I go to my next flight as it is the same aircraft that I had left with my items which I will be boarding again. I spoke to airway employee who told me he had in fact, found the bag and gave it to Lost and Found but said it is too late for me to get my item. He suggested when I get home Sydney (which is the flight I was boarding to) and try to contact Etihad to retrieve my item. I got home and called Etihad help centre in Belgrade who advised that they can make an exception and send the item back to me. I immediately filled out a file and received an email from Etihad Airway that they can send the item back to me. I responded back within a few minutes but I received no further follow up email. After an hours wait I then contacted their Facebook page and the contact person said there is nothing they can do. I got mixed messages from them on my item. It was disappointing to be jerked around and not being told clearly how to retrieve my item. I believe if I had received proper support I would have been able to get my item back within the airport (as I had 2 hours to spare). I will never fly or recommend Etihad again if this is how they handle customer issue. I acknowledge I made a human error and left an item, but I tried my best within that 10 min mistake to do my best to get my item back. It ended my trip on a bad note."

I requested softly but she said its a paid seat and it was Etihad policy not to allow anyone to take those seats. I felt that Etihad does not have consideration and empathy to its passenger's coupled with bad quality food and service. However, some stewardesses especially from Asia except Sub-continent are pleasant. The worst are from eastern Europe. They did not even smile.

Having flown with Etihad for the 1st time, I was initially satisfied. However, my 1st impression has been completely broken and now find myself writing this review in an attempt to express my great dissatisfaction and treatment upon my last booking with Etihad. I booked a flight from Sydney to Frankfurt for my Australian wife. At this time I was unsure about her visa conditions in Germany, so I called Etihad asking how I should make her booking. The Etihad agent informed me that because my wife didn’t yet have the long-term visa, that she need to book a return ticket within 3 months after her arrival, otherwise she wouldn’t be allowed to board the flight to Germany. She then recommended to book a return ticket, as a classic or flex, to have low or no cancellations cost. I proceeded to book the “deal” ticket for the outbound flight and the classic for the return flight. Once we arrived in Germany and my wife was granted her visa, so I then called Etihad to cancel the return flight as already having previously explained I would do. That’s when the cycle of disappointments started. I was told the 1st time that in Etihad’s policy “Most restricted refund fare rule applies in the event that different fare choices are combined” and that my flight is not eligible for cancellation, since I “automatically agree when booking a flight”. I replied that I wasn't told this condition and that I should book either Classic or Flex. I was then answered that an investigation process was being started to check this call and they will contact me. After over 1 week of waiting, I called Etihad again, just to be told that they only traced the last 2 calls, but not the 1st one I made, which is where I was given the wrong instructions. I was told again that they would start another investigation and that they would call me back. After several weeks, again there was no call back as promised. I’m therefore extremely disappointed by Etihad’s customer service. After my most recent call to Etihad, I was told that they couldn’t find the 1st call and starting an investigation and that I would receive a call back. At this point I don’t know if I should laugh or cry? Etihad finds 2 calls, but not the 1st one, even though I provided date and timing, and it was due to that call that I was wrongly informed and proceeded to book the return ticket. Otherwise, I would have never bought the return ticket. It was totally wrong to advise me that I need to buy a return at Etihad to prove that my wife will leave the country within 3 months – since I could have booked a flight to London for less than 50 Euros (having been told this by the immigration officer later on). Also, I would have not bought the ticket for 1100 AUD, if the agent had told tell the canceling conditions, and I made it very clear that I would be cancelling the return flight. Apart from that, the booking process itself was extremely misleading. If you book a return flight, and chose the outbound flight deal for one way and the classic for the return, it is then clearly shown on the return flight that it can be canceled. So there is absolutely no indication that “Most restricted refund fare rule applies” from the beginning till the end of the whole booking process. But it's so easy from an IT point of view. This is misleading the customer when you don’t have such important information which changes the prices for cancellation. I won’t never fly again with Etihad and recommend the same to my friends and family."

I'm unsure which was worse, the abhorrent service from the flight attendants or the measly food servings which no longer includes a salad or crackers or butter or jam. I was expecting the same service from Etihad that I had experienced last year but to my disappointment, their standards have nosedived. Quality is missing from every aspect, from the food to the flight attendant service to the range of movies available. Instead, it appears that they are more interested in up selling food and drinks from their on-board menu. It feels like they deliberately make you hungry and/or thirsty by serving you smaller meals and coming around only once for drinks, just so you can buy from their on-board menu. The prices by the way, are not exactly affordable, e.g US$3 for a small nut bar or US$4 for a bag of crisps."

Despite my severe reservations about the food and drinks service, I still felt able to recommend Etihad. After this return flight, my opinion has changed. The food on this flight was poor. The bread roll was in edible, the chicken had an unpleasant texture and of course the lack of food left my family feeling hungry. Fortunately I had brought food from home. The need to pay for food towards the end of the flight is demeaning for all involved and has resulted in Etihad feeling like a low cost carrier. Other niggles include the entertainment system not being turned on till well into the flight and then turned off during the descent. The cabin lights being turned on maybe 2 hours before landing for this paid food service, then the lights going down again. When the price of an Etihad return flight to London Is usually far more than the same flight with British Airways, I really cannot recommend Etihad anymore. I have booked two return flights to London with British Airways for the summer and Christmas."

Once we got into the plane and we waiting for the take of, we got informed that the there is some technical issues and they have to switch off the power. All of us had to sit with no a/c under +30 digress temperature in plane. It lasted for almost 3 hours, and they were switching on and off the electricity. Some of the people had to ask for medical assistance. Later on, we got informed that we need to step out from the flight (on the same time no one confirm the cancellation of the flight). We had to wait in the airport terminal for 6 hours more to get the final decision that the flight is cancelled. Keeping us waiting we got served with chocolates and water which was already ridiculous, and after all we got cold food from the plane itself. The person who was handling the complaint, first of all, was not the direct representative from the Etihad airways and was closing his name tag as some people tried to take a picture of his name.  I hope the Etihad airways could make sure that the flights are working and in good condition before they let people to get into the flight. I wouldn't recommend taking Etihad any longer."

I'll start off by saying that I can't really complain as I was paying a mere US$760 to travel halfway around the world to Madrid & back during the super peak period of the UEFA Chanpions League Final. That being said, I found Etihad to be mediocre at best. At least they were fairly on time and make an effort to be. I found that the seat pitch at 30 inches meant that legroom was compromised. That extra 1 inch makes a lot of difference, and I found the offerings on competitors to be at least decent at 31-32 inches, which is perhaps more ideal for long-haul flights. I would be referring to competitors like Qatar, Emirates, Turkish, Finnair etc. They also seemed stingy with the food & beverage & snack service as others have mentioned - hence I wouldn't elaborate. What really irritated me more is that the dhow-shaped tray that the food was served on has absolutely zero purpose other than aesthetics and it kept slipping down my tray table. Super irritating. Many passengers were also irked that the IFE system (specifically the movies & TV) is turned on only after the main ascent & will be shut down before the main descent. That's an hour of IFE gone. Passengers are still able to browse through connecting flight details or view the overhead plane cameras. I travelled only with hand luggage and hence I had no problems or negative experiences with ground luggage handling. But the standard 23kg was offered. As 95% of passengers would only be passing through Abu Dhabi, it is also worthwhile to note that connecting flights are fairly seamless and security probably wouldn't take more than 10-15 mins or so. At this price point (below US$800 for a transcontinental flight) I certainly wouldn't mind flying with them again. I wouldn't be terribly excited about it though."

Helma Mulhall",,7th June 2019,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Dublin via Abu Dhabi,June 2019,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,,1,no,1,"  Sydney to Dublin via Abu Dhabi. Having flown with Etihad previously and having had a great experience, my husband and I were amazed at the decline of service provided this time. On the flight from Sydney to Abu Dhabi we were treated very indifferently by the cabin crew and the inflight service was very substandard compared to our previous flight with Etihad and other airlines. Our first meal out of Sydney consisted of a poor quality warm meal, a cold, hard roll in a packet, and a packet with a slice of cake and a plastic cup of drink of our choice. There was an announcement and also a brochure of the snacks you could purchase. All prepackaged chips, nuts, noodles in a cup, etc. No salads or sandwiches, or quality warm meals. Once the meals trays had been removed the cabin crew disappeared. No crew came with drinks. After an hour or 2, I was very thirsty and wanted water and my husband wanted a cup of wine. He pressed the crew call button at least 4 times, (which turned off by itself after about 10 minutes each time). No crew came. So we went to the galley where there were 3 staff. One was eating her meal, the other 2 not appearing to be doing any specific work. I was allowed to take a cup of water. My husband was told to wait for a while. While waiting politely at the galley, with the staff just standing / sitting there, another man came up and asked for a plastic cup of wine. He too was told to wait. About half an hour of waiting at the galley, with the crew, he was finally given a cup of wine. During the middle of the flight a pack of sandwiches had been given out. As I had been asleep when they were being distributed, when a crew member did walk past, I asked if I could have some sandwiches. She questioned me as though I was asking for a second helping. On the flight from Abu Dhabi to Dublin, an announcement was made they would be serving us a ‘complimentary meal’, after which we could purchase from their onboard snack menu. We were presented with a cold soggy bread roll and a drink. I asked for a glass of wine with my meal, and the flight attendant said he would come back with it, which didn’t happen. We were offered a few small containers of packaged water a few times during the flight. The attitude of the cabin crew during both flights was very cool, as though they were doing us a huge service. Positives, the seat was comfortable, the toilets were clean (probably because we had little need to use them because of the shortage of fluids distributed), and good inflight entertainment. We are booked with Etihad for our return flight. I will be and recommend to anyone, doing a long haul flight with Etihad at the moment to bring along your own food and bring along some containers you can fill up with water after you go through security. Would I recommend flying with Etihad at the moment. No! We were made to feel very unwelcome and everything was too much trouble."

I have flown Etihad in the past and enjoyed the service but was disappointed with my latest flight. The airline seems confused as to whether it is offering a premium or low cost product. Certainly the fares are premium but the service is low cost, particularly the new meal service. On the short hop from Baku to Abu Dhabi we received a soggy wrap and a piece of cake with one drinks round. From Abu Dhabi to Bangkok it was a main course (rice and lamb, no vegetables) and a piece of cake, with one drinks round. This was a night flight and after the meal service the cabin crew was not to be seen until just before landing. There is a range of food for purchase but as the nearest galley to me was closed up with the lights off I am not sure where I had to head if I was hungry. Boarding at Baku was fine (the plane was almost empty) but chaotic at Abu Dhabi. The gate was crowded with most passengers having to stand owing to a lack of seats. There was no organised boarding; it was a free for all. Both flights arrived on time. The aircraft was clean and in good condition but the touch screens were difficult to operate and required multiple prods to respond. The inflight entertainment offerings were ok. Etihad needs to have a long hard look at its product. If is to be a low cost airline then fares need to drop. And either way, the inflight service needs to improve. Air Arabia, Indigo and Air Asia, all low cost carriers, offer markedly better products for much lower fares."

Passengers boarded the plane and had to wait inside for 4 hours with no air-conditioning or ventilation with a 30 degree heat outside, some people had to ask for medical help. After that dreadful wait all passengers were asked to leave the plane and wait uncertain amount of time in the airport. The crew did no provide any information on how long we would have to wait, we did not even receive a food voucher, all we got offered were some candies and water! Are you kidding me, we were stuck in the plane for hours and you didn't even offer food? I had to claim a refund through the Etihad contact centre but had to call three times in order to get help, seems like some operators don't know how to handle refunds. I do not recommend anybody to fly with Etihad."

I think the seats could use a bit more leg room, but they did have a power outlet which was nice but it would be great if the seat had a foot rest. The value for money was good though but I wish you didn't have to pay for wifi.

The outbound and inbound flights were on a days old Boeing 787-10 which was spotless as you would expect. This is where the positives end. I was pretty shocked at how the inflight service has been paired back; only one drinks round during which I got the impression one is actively discouraged from requesting anything alcoholic. The meal service is minimalistic to say in the least: one main course and cold bread roll, that's it. No desert, salad, butter or wine offered. Before landing some biscuits offered as 'second snack'. What was worse is the constant promotion of their buy on board menu, which was embarrassing as a supposedly full service carrier and national airline of the UAE. This confuses passengers and ultimately leaves them feeling ripped off. It seems that passengers are paying the price of Etihad's failed investments in other airlines. Not sure who is advising them but this cost-cutting is glaringly obvious and will damage their brand. They may recoup money in the short term but in the long term passengers will vote with their feet."

When you are ready to make the bed up, there is no soft linen or cover placed over the seat, instead it’s up to you to recline and may the seat down and simply lay back down on top of the seat cover which is as hard as a rock. You are given a tiny fabric pillow that does not have a linen cover and a blanket. The space for your feet is very narrow and I had to have one leg up and one straight to fit in (I am only 180cm tall) on our return flight, again they separated us and charged us an extra $77eruo for 2kg extra luggage!

I remember flying Etihad 5 years ago on the Johannesburg - Delhi route and it was the preferred airline for most due to their stellar crew, aircraft & inflight service. Those days are gone. Etihad is now a low cost international carrier. When you board; you will be greeted by a 15 minute long sequence on your IFE promoting everything from snacks that you can buy to WiFi which you can purchase inflight. The IFE system then cuts out 20 minutes before landing and is replaced by a set of adverts and the flight map. The meal is a small circular tray which consists of a cold packaged bun, a meal drowning in cooking oil; it consists of zero salad, no butter, no condiments for the actual food. The staff whilst mostly pleasant have also resorted themselves to the LCC attitude of barricading the service levels based on the “class” that you’re seated in. Sure the fares are good and the aircraft is quite empty but if you are looking for good old service & a decent hard product; you can forget about Etihad. The airline is rapidly heading down the low cost carrier model which is unusual for an Arab/Gulf carrier who are normally cash flushed. The nail in the coffin for me was the A321 which they used for the service from Abu Dhabi to Delhi; the flight was crammed, there were major delays and the crew couldn’t handle the passengers which showed that they hadn’t been briefed from the top down. I wish the airline luck in gaining customer and market share back but doubt that people will be thinking of Etihad as their first choice."

Worst airline I have ever flown.  I chose and paid for my seats via their online website and paid an extra $220 odd to choose my seats. What I booked, and what I received in reality once boarding the plane were completely different. When I was booking my seat, I believed I was booking the last row in the cabin, a 3 row seat configuration with a seat missing in the middle according to what I was presented with. In reality, it was a 2 seat row, with both seats right next to each other, completely different to what I thought I was purchasing. In addition to purchasing this so called ""premium seat"", there was also no storage in the overhead locker. That space is reserved for the cabin screw to put the blankets etc. The seats that I ended up with were not premium by a long shot. It was a total scam from the moment I purchased these seats. Next, is the WiFi. Onboard WiFi is an absolute joke. I paid $5 USD for 30mb of data. This allowed me to essentially check my email quickly browse no more than a couple of web pages before it ran out. An absolute rip off. By contrast, when I last flew Emirates, I think I paid abut 3 Euro, for unlimited time and browsing. It was amazing to say the least. Also, being a long haul flight >14 hours, I decided not to pack my toothbrush or an eye mask as of course you would expect to receive these on such a long haul flight. Wrong. No toothbrush, no eye mask. I was starting to feel like I was flying a budget airline which by the end of my trip I had come to the realisation that, I was in actual fact flying an Emirates wanna be airline. Food. Food was absolutely terrible. Surely you would think you could simply check your seat pocket to see what you can expect for your couple of meals on such a long flight? Wrong. We were presented with ""Chicken or Beef"" most of the time. No idea what we were actually being served, and the food is not labelled. I guess they do this so that you can instead pay extra and buy from their new inflight menu if you want any decent food? Another telltale sign of a budget airline. Long story short. Etihad are the wanna be Emirates of the skies. I will never fly them again if I can help it. I really thought I would be flying something similar to Emirates. It couldn't have been more different. if you set your expectations very low, they are an ok airline and get you from A to B which I guess is the most important thing. If you want to be comfortable and have an enjoyable time in the sky, stay clear of this mob. "

Just got back from a trip to Egypt and had a total of 3 missed connections because of their delays and their customer ""service"" is non-existent. I honestly can't remember the last time I experienced such bad service. It started with a 4+ hour delay at JFK, on our way to Abu Dhabi. No explaination for the delay and when we finally got to Abu Dhabi, we of course missed our connecting flight and the agents at Abu Dhabi were clearly not interested in helping anyone out. Finally a lady at the transfer desk started raising a huge fuss and I think they finally took care of her, after she caused a major, loud fuss with the manager someone finally took the time to get. This miss with our flight of course caused us to miss our connecting flight in Cairo. Again, they were no help. Coming back home, we were waiting for our flight out of Abu Dhabi and it's well past boarding time and not a single agent is saying anything about a delay. I finally ask the gate agent what's going on and he says the flight is delayed, ABOUT an hour (this airline has no exact times for anything. we got the estimated departure at JFK). So everyone is sitting there not knowing their flight is delayed. Ridiculous! I will never use this airline again."

I was stuck in between because couldn't able handle everything at a time! I was looking for help and a passenger helped me. They don't care at all. Friends please be careful with this airways."

S Halton",,21st May 2019,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Abu Dhabi to Cairo,May 2019,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,,1,no,1,"  Abu Dhabi to Cairo. By far the worst flight customer service experience I have ever received. Arrived to airport 2hrs before and was told it would cost $150 USD for my checked bag. Although online it says all Economy class has baggage allowance going to Africa. I pay for the $150 and head to the passport control just to be stopped again and told I also need to pay for my carry on bag. This wasn’t told to me at check in and while checking in the other bag. Which carried all of my valuables, cards and cash as well. Flight is slowly approaching at this time. I proceed back to the counter and ask if there was anyway I could receive my bag back. They said no it would take too long. So I’m like what else should I do? They said pay, and I continue to explain where my cash/card were. They sat and watched me for 40min distressed, crying, and asking for help and did nothing to help me other than say sorry you can leave the bag here which held over a $1000 worth of items inside or you pay for a new flight. It only cost $60 bucks for the new amount for check in. So I had to paid $430 dollars for a new flight because they wouldn’t bring my bag back to pay and they wouldn’t let me move on. On top of this I lost $150 for the bags I paid for before as well as the money I spent on the original flight."

Etihad is the new Ryanair. Used to love flying with Etihad; travelled at least 3 times per year from Germany to India and back with them. Since my last travel in September last year, a lot has changed. Seat selection during booking or check-in is only available 24 hours before the flight for free, or otherwise with additional cost of 30 EUR/flight. The irony is that the system automatically placed me on a seat in the first three rows of the aircraft which is coming for higher price if you want to book that seat. I prefer to have a window seat in the two last rows, as often the other seats remain empty and i get a full row. This would be a cheaper seat. Still for changing the seat i was charged the full amount. Food: The new trays are pathetic, they don't lock with the tray table and slide on the tray table all the time. They are very small, so they can hold a ridiculously small portion of food. Originally on a flight AUH to DUS or FRA passengers were served two meals (and two rounds of beverages, sometimes even more). Forget about it. One menu, one beverage, done. If you have desire for more, you can pick from the new salt and spicy menu for which they again charge! The Entertainment system is still of the high quality it used to be, but it is getting filled with advertisements for Etihad, the new salt or spicy (chargeable) menu etc. The Entertainment system starts only 20 minutes after take-off and is switched off 20 minutes before landing. That was different earlier. I don't feel that Etihad deserves to be a top ranked airline anymore, as it is not a full service airline any longer. It is rather a new version of Ryan Air, they just don't sell lottery tickets. I am very disappointed with this new trend, so i will look out for other airlines. Maybe pay 100 EUR per flight more, but have all services i deserve."

S Muscher",,15th May 2019,Family Leisure,Business Class,Frankfurt to Abu Dhabi,February 2019,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,,1,no,1,"  Frankfurt to Abu Dhabi. I recently had a horrible experience with Etihad Airways, but their service from Europe has gone down extremely. Lounges closed, no customer service, they redirect business class passengers to the call center because the local staff at check-in and gate can not even answer basic questions. My family and me, including our two kids (10 and 5 years old), booked a trip through a travel agent with Etihad Airways, including four business class flights from Frankfurt, Germany, and hotel in Abu Dhabi. We were able to check in online without any problems (we entered all passport information, including passport expiration date, and were not informed of any problems with the passport). After arriving at the airport today, we were also able to go to the gate without problems— but then we were refused to board the plane, because two of our passports were only valid for another three months, not six months as seemingly required by the Abu Dhabi authorities. We acknowledge that it would have been our duty to inform ourselves better before traveling, though given the acceptance of the passport in Etihad’s travel systems it definitely made it hard, if not impossible, for us to spot our honest mistake. But, and that’s really the big problem here where we believe Etihad treated us horribly as customers, when we politely asked your ground personal to rebook the two of us (me and my younger son) to the flight later in the week, enabling us to get a new passport, they refused and gave us a tiny piece of paper with the comment ""just call our call center"": Seriously, Etihad, is that how you treat your business class customers? And all of this despite them seeing first-hand our 5-year old crying and crying, since the only thing the little guy could understand was that we were not allowed to go on vacation. But it got even worse: The call center also refused to change the booking, unless we were willing to pay a rebooking fee of over $4.500 for just the two tickets. Given that we initially paid over 8.000 € for our tickets, this sounded like an insult more than anything else to us. Ground person pressured us even further to quickly decide, obviously keen to depart soon, so under massive pressure and with no ability to weigh our options, we had to stay in Frankfurt, and did not board the plane. Our vacation was destroyed, both of our kids cried for hours, until we then found a last-minute hotel at Frankfurt airport (the incident happened in the late evening). Overall, the most unpleasant experience I ever had with any airline in my life, and I have made hundreds of flights. And it seems I am not alone, looking at the web, I found hundreds of bad reviews. Etihad lost almost two billion last year, partially in their failed takeover of now bankrupt Air Berlin, and my hunch is, that they will go bankrupt themselves if they do not improve."

I booked and paid in full for a flight in August 2018. My agent also pre-selected seats in August 2018. My flight was mid-April 2019. I got to the airport, queued for an hour and when I finally got to the check-in desk, I was told that I was being denied boarding as the flight was overbooked. They also did this to about 10 other people. After protesting with no result and waiting around for hours, I was told I would have to come back the following night for a replacement flight and guess what I'm no longer flying direct to Amsterdam, I have to fly to Rome and then get a connecting flight from there (which overall added about 5 hours to the travel time). They left this bit out actually - I just saw it on the re-issued travel documents much to my dismay. In total I lost a day and a half of my trip. My trip was about 19 days in total so to lose that much time was considerable. I had to change hotel reservations, cancel plans to visit a certain location (because of the time I lost), travel an hour home, travel an hour back the next night, wait again to check in hoping I wouldn't be stung a second time. The flight over was dreadful. I was assured that I had been given the seats I wanted however when I got on the plane I realised that this was incorrect and therefore had a very uncomfortable flight with no sleep. I complained to the head office by email however I was told nothing else would be done and basically they overbook sometimes and I just had to deal with that. Did it matter I paid them in full nearly 9 months in advance? Not at all. Did it matter my agent had pre-selected seats 9 months before? Not at all - no record apparently. Did it matter this was my third long-haul flight with the airline in four years? Nope. I will never fly this airline again. The upset they caused me when I've been a loyal customer is disgusting.  You have to pay for in-flight wifi (which you don't have to on some other airlines I have flown with recently)."

G Martin",,13th May 2019,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Abu Dhabi to Manchester,April 2019,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," Do not fly with Etihad if you want the flight you paid for. They have a widespread policy this spring/summer of massively overbooking flights (I saw around 50 people who'd been put in the same position as me in the space of an hour) and, unlike other airlines, do not routinely offer money or upgrades to incentivise passengers to switch their flight so that people who really need to get on the flight can get aboard. I was bumped off my flight back to Manchester from Abu Dhabi as the flight had been massively overbooked. As a result I lost a full days pay yet I was offered no explanation, apology or hotel - even though the wait was over 8 hours in the middle of the night, and had to sleep in the airport lounge. They offered me a $300 Etihad voucher (useless to me as I will never fly with Etihad again after this experience) and they refused to upgrade me to business class on the flight the next day (which set off 2 hours behind schedule) so that I could get some sleep, despite admitting that there were 9 business class seats available. Note that there is no complaints policy (no number/ email) other than a 'feedback form' and, unlike almost any other airline, Etihad is not EU registered and therefore if they mess you around and ruin your journey as they did mine then there is nothing you can do to claim compensation (unless you're travelling within the EU). Even members of staff at the airport were admitting that the overbooking policy was ridiculous yet when I complained via the form I was simply told that no compensation other than the voucher would be offered and that they 'look forward to welcoming me on another Etihad flight soon'. It completely ruined my trip and, having looked at the thousands of other reviews of people with similar experiences, I would highly recommend to anyone that they avoid this airline and travel with a more reliable and professional one."

The food portions small and quality was below average. The thing that annoyed me most however was the new trays. It doesn’t stabilise on the seat back tray and moves around while you are trying to eat which lead me to spill me orange juice all over the carpet. This new “enhancement” in dining by Etihad has eliminated the need for the caterer to build the tray, instead the flight attendant is now required to do so. An obvious cost cutting measure, however, this also extends the whole meal service and there were a lot of unhappy unsatisfied passengers waiting longer than we normally would wait if the tray was prepared beforehand like it is with every other airline. In addition, I found the the flight attendants to be extremely rude and disinterested. I had to press the call button four times to ask for water because they kept turning it off. I don't recommend flying with Etihad."

I had the misfortune of travelling from Islamabad to Sydney via Abu Dhabi on 1 May by EY234 and to further to Sydney by EY450. Beginning with Booking Counter at Islamabad, our Australian passports and tickets to Sydney were not enough but they demanded our valid Pakistani passports to confirm that our stay in Pakistan had been legal, as they said. I thought only immigration authorities could put such questions. My wife casually mentioned pain in her shoulder to me due to an old fracture, she was asked to get the doctor’s certificate for travel. Somehow we met their requirements and then boarded the flight. During the flight the service was hopeless, the meals even Kosher meals were not fresh, rather cold and I would grade 3rd class. Next flight to Sydney from Abu Dhabi was 45 minutes late. Some comfortable seats that were unsold, remained unoccupied and the staff did not allow upgrading to anyone. The service was again hopeless and meals including Kosher meals were disappointing. The staff vanished for about 4 after serving initial meals and returned only to deliver next prepared, cold and poorly packed meals."

I used to give high marks to Etihad, but unfortunately their cost-cutting got out of control, to the point I can no longer recommend them. You either have to pay for your seat selection now or give yourself anxiety by checking-in 48 hours before the flight with auto-allocated seat and then changing it to the one you want 24 hours before the flight for free - that is, if there are any left. Both flights were operated by Airbus 321, which should soon get a ""refurbished"" cabin with no IFE screens (and the flight from Moscow is 5 hours long). I lucked out in having the old planes, so the screens were there. Ground service in Moscow was quite bad, with the staff being apathetic and rude, not enforcing any lines, being horribly slow at boarding etc. The flights were completely full. Seating was not that bad, with acceptable pitch and good seat width, but nothing to write home about. The meal service was just embarassing - there is no more salad, no more proper dessert, no cheese or butter. You just get a hot dish (which is not larger than before, unlike Etihad claims) with mediocre taste and a bun or two. That's it. The point is to leave you hungry so that you buy - yes, buy - snacks from their onboard menu. There were no printed menus for the complimentary meal service, so I could not know even what drinks were available. On the way to AUH I requested white wine with my meal and then asked for the same when they brought around coffee. The crew member says they all ran out! I did not see people drinking large quantities of wine, so I guess they just loaded 1-2 bottles for the whole cabin on a dinner-time flight. Embarassing. The IFE was quite decent but the system kept microfreezing, which was annoying. The crew never brought around any drinks apart from the initial service, but they were very cheerful and pleasant and ready to assist when you asked them. There were no blankets, just small pillows. On the way back it was pretty much the same, only the crew did frequent water runs through the cabin. The food was just as sad. I paid for a bulkhead seat and was surrounded by screaming and shoving children, so the flight was a nightmare. Overall, I don't get Etihad's positioning at all. They used to be a premium airline, but now they are mediocre with strong low-cost influences, which does not relfect in the pricing. I would avoid in the future."

We paid to select seats to guarantee that we were seated together. I had heard stories of couples not being allocated seats together. We found the website very slow and after doing 8 seat allocations for the four flights the Etihad site crashed. When we logged on again we found that my husband was in a seat further down the plane in a section which was $86.50 more expensive to select than the seats we had been selecting. We had not selected that seat! We had only selected the cheaper option on all the 8 allocations and always had 2 seats together. We straight away contacted Flight Centre who dealt directly with Etihad and they placed him in the row with me in the cheaper seat allocation area. We have been trying since March to recover the cost of that error on their system but they tell us it is not refundable! The fact that we had to pay $385.70 to select seats in the first place is not acceptable. This was our first overseas trip and we would never recommend Etihad or fly with them again.

Easily the worst long haul flight I have been on. Cabin was aged but acceptable. Back seat screens were tiny but workable. But the food, this was a 14 hour flight. Initial dinner meal was simply the foil tray (half filled with a single tiny piece of beef) and a tiny bread accompaniment. No side salad, no fruit. Dessert was a tiny brownie. No further food was served for 11 hours. And when it was, it was a similarly tiny meal. And with no dessert this time! We were also warned of ""soft turbulence"" but I had checked the weather before take off and it looked as if we were going to fly between two tropical storms. It turned out to be the roughest flight I have ever been on - the seatbelt sign stayed on for 5 hours straight (although after a while the FAs ignored this). One of the storms later became cyclone Fani. I appreciate the pilots cannot control the weather but it is always preferable to be warned. I will not ever fly this airline again."

I hadn’t flown Etihad for 2 years (always tried to avoid after multiple disappointments) and decided to give a new chance to them. It was a huge mistake. Check in staff created a big issue for 1.2 kgs extra while I didn’t have any hand luggage because of my back pain but forced me to carry it or pay. They actually gave me the option of putting those 1.2 kgs in the garbage. Crews seems disinterested in their work and you feel they are doing you a favor being on board with you. I am an easy traveler and always go to the galley if I need water or anything. But they let you feel that you are disturbing them. But they are fine to talk loudly about their life and personal matters. Food was a joke not about the quantity but the quality. Couldn’t eat it and the onboard paid for food was not really interesting to me. I was lucky enough to have my preferred seat but a whole family of 5 was separated during a 7 hours flight. I understood that EY is going through hard time but at least make the ticket price more affordable as it isn't worth all this money for a low cost style. I will definitely not fly with them again.

Re the inflight experience - the drinks cart only came around twice throughout the entire flight 14 hour. They serve smaller meals (bun + small meal) so you’re still left hungry afterwards. This is when you’re compelled to buy snacks from their expensive “Sweet & Salty” menu because this is no longer complimentary. When I approached the crew to purchased duty free products I did not find them to be friendly. This is where I usually struggle with Etihad, because I find they have among the most inconsistent service of any airline. Some crews are great, while others aren’t, though a majority of crews are just mediocre, in my experience. They’ve changed up their business model and rather than being a global airline, they want to be a boutique airline serving those traveling to & from Abu Dhabi. Presumably they’re hoping to attract premium yields with that, and if that’s the case, making the product worse isn’t the way to go. These penny-pinching measures could send this once highly regarded airline spiralling down from an amazing airline a few years back to almost a low cost carrier now."

Never had meals so stingy with any other airline, barely enough for a Mouse. Quality not an issue, but quantity a real issue. One alcoholic drink served for the whole 7 hour duration.

Sorry Etihad your 5 Stars are certainly not as bright as I expected and we will probably revert back to the other two carriers in the ME 3 group.

So Etihad have entered the race to the bottom in style. Simply avoid regardless of price. They no longer bother with pre-dinner drinks, the drinks trolley only came by once on both legs of my flight. The food is the real headline grabber, you get a little tray on a little board, chicken or beef is all your told. Menus are gone, so is a side salad, cheese, decent cutlery, oh and no butter with bread!? Dessert is served after with tea or coffee, and then that is the last you will see of any staff. There is no longer a second meal service instead there is a menu where you can but food and drink 'Ryanair' style, and its all rubbish. The staff look as tired as the Boeing 777's do. Sadly I still have to fly back home with them but will be sure to pack some food for the journey. Will not be back."

Rahul Tripathi",,21st April 2019,Business,Business Class,Mumbai to London via Abu Dhabi,April 2019,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,,1,no,1,"  Mumbai to London via Abu Dhabi. Really pathetic service and worst airline ever. Had booked business class ticket from Mumbai to London via Abu Dhabi as per there stop over policy given on website after booking they declined a hotel and asked for charges of AED 500, then they declined the chauffeur saying stop over is too less. Finally had to cancel the plan."

Etihad have in recent times been deceiving people in their online bookings, but most recently with their seat selections. When making a miles redemption booking I progressed on to make a seat selection without realizing that I was actually paying for each seat selected. I went all the way to the payment page, went ahead and paid (perhaps I should have paid more attention to the final amount, but it was not clear and I was in a rush to book). Only after finishing the booking I realized I was charged $30 for one seat and $10 for the other, I have never paid for selecting a seat, and these seats would have been free at check-in. Realizing I paid for seats that I did not want to pay for, I contacted Etihad by email asking for a refund of the seat payments. After several back and forth emails, they refused to refund my money. They claim it was clear on the site that these seats were chargeable. I have a relative who also fell for this deceptive seat selection process and also paid for seats without realizing. It is bad enough that they charge for seats (given that are apparently not a budget airline, although you could argue this now), but to deceive their paying customers into paying for seats they did not want to pay for, and then refusing to refund the payment (regardless of who was at fault) is disgraceful! Further evidence of Etihad's greed and lust for money from their customers, with so many examples like this in recent years. The icing on the cake- today I wanted to change a booking I made with miles, and the only way to make this change is to contact the call center. Previously to call Etihad, you dialed a 02 number, which was a local number that was charged at a local rate. However, in line with their money hungry ways, they have now changed their call center number to a 600 number which is charged at a premium per minute rate. So, not just can we not make changes online in some cases, we are also forced to call their call center and pay premium rates for making the call. Absolutely disgraceful from an airline that deserves all the bad reviews it is getting. You should be ashamed of yourselves."

I was hoping to have a good flight from Melbourne to Istanbul but it was not to be. While the aircraft itself was decently spec'd, the food and beverage offering was below satisfactory. They don't include the standard butter with your bread, salad and dessert that you'd find in served at other major airlines. Instead, I was compelled to purchase snacks from their exorbitantly ""Choose Wisely"" menu. I paid USD 4 for a small chocolate bar. I hope that my return leg in a few days will be better."

I really wonder how this 2/3 star airline made it to the 5 star level. Planes are modern and have a nice cabin with reasonably good IFE. The good stops here. On the 7-hour flight from CDG to AUH, a tiny and inedible meal with no starter or dessert was served and the rest was only buy on board. Feels more like Norwegian than a 5-star Gulf airline. Boarding was completely disorganised and the bus from Abu Dhabi to Dubai is staffed by completely incompetent people. They were letting people on the bus without checking the tickets or the number of luggage pieces. To be avoided altogether. "

An airline severely let down by ground staff and cost savings. If you have a bassinet on the booking you cannot check in online & a first come basis. We got to airport before check in opened, only 1 baby in front of us in the queue. Staff advised us that bassinet confirmed and aisle seat, repeated same at end. Come to board, and no bassinet, no aisle etc. Cabin crew reiterated the 1st come message, but when we explained they were bemused. 2nd flight was better but again their systems did not ack the linked booking so not seated together. This is a long route (14.5 hr + 7.5hr) and available food is a joke. You have to pay for extra. No breakfast on landing in Manchester after 7.5 hrs and the main meal is a roll without butter and the hot meal, I was absolutely starving."

Then after half an hour they came to me saying I have to make new booking and I have to call internationally to Etihad office to make the booking.

My experience on this flight was far from enjoyable. It was marred with a series of disappointing and underwhelming moments. For example, when the IFE was not working, the fight crew refused to assist me for almost 3 hours. Whenever I pressed the call bell, they would switch it off and ignore my request for help. As with the experience from other guests, I can attest that the crew spend more time chatting amongst themselves rather than serve passengers who've requested for assistance."

C Markam",A380,15th April 2019,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Sydney to London via Abu Dhabi,April 2019,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  My wife and I are in our late 60`s and retired. Last June we purchased, on the Etihad website, two return Business Class tickets to London for departure from Sydney on April 27 2019. The cost of the 2 tickets was $AUD 14,326.52. which was paid in full at the time of purchase. 4 weeks ago I was diagnosed with male breast cancer and so require radical surgery and several months of chemotherapy. I cancelled the flights but Etihad says that this promotional fare does not allow any change of date nor any refund. They also say that the ticket will expire on the 12 month anniversary of purchase. When asked what our options were, I was told that we should travel on the date booked and that was it. A written online complaint elicited the response that I should contact their call centre, who I had previously talked to and who were unhelpful, and on one occasion degrading and demeaning. The purpose of this review is to share our experience, warn others and to request from the wider travelling community any suggestions regarding what to do next."

My review involves the awful inedible food served during these long haul flights. No snacks or drinks offered during the 11 hours. Etihad needs to find someone who knows about airline food.

Checking in ahead did not work, neither online nor through the app. The app actually recommended to call them 'as soon as possible' but then the automated phone service just referred you back to their website. So this was absolutely useless. The check in was then predictably slow with a long queue. As a result the ground team seemed in a hurry and were neither particularly helpful nor friendly. The seats were horrible. For a 14 hour flight this was remarkable little leg space. Cramped in like in a budget airline. The food wasn't very appetising and while most of the staff seemed professional they didn't go above and beyond to make this a pleasant flight experience. A lot of time for them was spent chatting in the galley. Will definitely not make the mistake of flying with Etihad again. Can't believe they are rated as a 'Five star airline'. Absolutely undeserved and miles off, Etihad is currently closer to a three star airline than a five star one."

We have flown Etihad Airways several times. We have traveled in economy and business class. My last trip was in Jan 2019, trip before that was in Oct 2017, both in business class. The service and amenities have really suffered in two years.  It started with booking tickets online. I had select the flights and was adding all the information they need (e.g. passenger name, preferences, etc.). By the time I was ready to enter credit card information, the website would not let me purchase the ticket because the fare had increased (by $1200 per ticket). It took me less then 10 minutes to enter information about two passengers. The price should have been locked. I called them three times and talked with three different customer reps, but they would not help. I even asked to speak to the manager and was not given chance to talk to a manager. I had to reduce my trip by three days to get lower fare. They stopped providing pajamas, slippers, playing cards in the plane. The quality of amenity kit has also gone down. After the plane took off I asked for a single malt whiskey and mixed nut which were served. Later on when I asked for it again I was told that they did not have single malt or nuts. They only had black label. How can you not have enough (small) bottles of single malt for business class? The lounge at Abu Dhabi needs updating. The lounge was very crowded and only had and did not have enough seats. It one mens toilet room (3 three urinal stalls and 3 toilet stalls). There were people standing in line. The type food in the lounge was same as two years ago, they have not changed the menu.   My wife wanted to extend her stay to take care of personal stuff so we called etihad, we were told that it would cost us $400 dollars cancellation fee (which is on their website), plus a single ticket from the higher tier for $3600 (this is not mentioned on their website). This is a rip off. Why can I not pay the fare difference? If I have to buy another ticket then why are they charging $400 cancellation fee? We did not extend her stay. It turns out that she has to go again soon, this time we bought business class ticket on Emirates. They provide free limo service to/from airport at both destinations for business class. I have heard good thing about them. I am sure they will be better than Etihad. My friends have traveled Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines and they said that they were very good."

I flew with Etihad only once before, around ten years ago, and I was very impressed by the service, food, and those little touches like hand lotion in the bathroom that make a flight a special journey. This time, however, it was quite a different experience. The food on both flights (I ordered gluten free) was just edible, really not tasty - no dressing in the salad, smelly fish. I understand they tried to make it healthy but it shouldn't eliminate tasty by default. Besides, the dinner was cold. There were no snacks at the end of the aircraft. The drinks were served at least half an hour after the food. The crew on the leg Abu Dhabi to Tokyo seemed to be interested in talking among themselves, blocking the access to the glasses with water. I normally drink a lot but in this case I gave up asking for a glass of water because it felt like I was constantly distracting them from an engaging conversation. And the crew didn't smile at all. It felt so weird. On the positive side, the entertainment was decent, with a lot of good movies to choose from. The flight was half empty, so one was able to stretch out on empty seats."

I paid for pre booked seats for me and my family and when we got to the airport they had seated us all over the plane. When I alerted ground staff of this they where rude and unhelpful. They had also seated people who hadn’t paid together which made me so angry. When we got onto the aircraft people where already sitting in our allocated seats so they left us standing for 20 mins while they tried to move people reluctantly. My little girls was crying because she thought we couldn’t go on holiday. After complaining to so called customer services they where even less helpful. They said they would consider a refund for the pre booked seats. From now on when I travel to UAE I will always choose Emirates who are a far superior airline. Coming back they took my money for 4 pre booked seats and only allocated 2 so again I had to contact them to sort that out. Ruined my holiday!

I tried to communicate with them by emails because there is no phone customer service but they changed the story and they said that they gave us the choice of keeping the same seats or change them to the seats we were not happy with. If there story is true why did they offer different seats to us. They offered $188 as a travel credit with them but I didn’t accept it. I feel I got ripped off and no one is actually listening to what I have to say.

Were told that aircraft had no blankets left to be handed out. Business class cabin gave a squeezy look with the front seat almost knocking on the back seat. Food quality was atrocious. Salmon was hard as a rock topped with artificial coloring and the coke was flat. A limited menu for a 9pm dinner flight. Salmon or vegetarian and that was that. Desert a chocolate brownie and no other choice.  Putting dishes named after Indian cities in its printed menu on Islamabad flight was terrible. "

My father, in Lebanon, has been rushed to the hospital and I booked a ticket immediately today to travel to be there with him only to find out, once I reached and waited in the line of the Economy Check-in, that my flight is overbooked. We waited an hour (me and my daughter) and the only solutions they provided us was a transit where we had to wait in another country for five hours or the same flight but tomorrow. Sorry, but it is your mistake I believe and you make us wait another day. I am travelling urgently and you say it’s not your business of personal matters. Well it is your business now since you’re the one who put us in this situation. You say your system is jammed well close the system once the tickets are booked. It isn’t surprising with Etihad as it happened with me and my family before and with people I know. There should be changes to your policy, I have never seen such lack of care to the people. Working team and manager were there to help us, but the problem isn’t with them, it’s with the policies and the company itself."

Very good quality food. Asked for alcoholic beverages on each segment and all was included. Good selection of IFE movies. A very good experience with them.

Meghan Watkins",,23rd March 2019,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Brisbane to Rome via Abu Dhabi,November 2018,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,,1,no,1,"  Brisbane to Rome via Abu Dhabi. Absolutely disgusted with Etihads support and services for an incorrect flight and then lack of communication, support and care. My partner booked a return flight with BYO jet with triple checked dates as they needed to correlate with mine and my families, and instead of BYO jet booking them for the 19th April as per our booking online, they booked them for the 19th November the year before which was 5 months before we were due to fly. After multiple attempts to speak and liase with Etihad, they then notified us of a $500 no show fee, which was 5 months after my partner was supposedly ""suppose to fly"" and it was only then that they told us they'd cancelled the entire flight and would not be giving us a refund, despite me and my family giving them the business of 5 x business class flights. It also states in their T + C that they do change and refund flights for a small fee of $140 or $170, yet they told my partner that they ""couldn't"" and none of their attempts to explain things to us made sense. The lady on the phone was also extremely rude and arrogant and probably should have had a sick day if she had things going on to make her behave so unprofessionally and uncaringly. I cannot believe how selfish and greedy some companies are. My partner has now gone onto book a flight with an entirely different airline because of some body else's mistake. No rectifying has been attempted at all, all this airline appears to care about is money and not the actual services they provide or even the success of their business. Definitely will not be flying with this airline again, all they care about is your money and not about the actual services they provide. If you are thinking about flying with them, please reconsider your decision, this is not a company that deserves anyones business"

Eventually they did but the voucher was a scratch type and did not work. The cabin crew refused to exchange but instead she gave me my money back. The food is terrible. One of the worst cuisines. Not only that, but only 2 meals on a 16 hour flight. And if you need juice, or refreshments there is an extra charge for that. Last I’ve known this was not a low-cost airlines. You are better of flying Emirates, Saudia or Qatar Airways, they are far superior and way better. Also Abu Dhabi has a really bad airport. I dont know how a giant airline could have a bad airport and have most of its planes park on stands rather than gates. "

Firstly my flight was overbooked, no explanation given to why and that I had to wait hours to find out if I was going to be held in Abu Dhabi for 24 hours. I was told I was. Then the transfer desk staff continued to ask for my personal information so that he could 'check I got on my flight ok', could I give him my business card or email? and a lot of other personal questions. I was promised an upgrade as part of this compensation, then I was told at check in the next day that this wasn't true and that I would not be. I complained about the inappropriate behavior from the check in staff the previous night and was told to email them. The email exchange with their customer service has been outrageous. They ignore questions, refuse to elaborate and barely apologise for a member of their staff abusing their position and asking for personal information. I asked to be given another point of contact to be told; 'Having reviewed your case, unfortunately, there is no need for us to transfer your case to another Guest Relations contact. I can see that we have emailed you in February and offered 5,000 miles apart from the USD200 travel voucher you received. Might I explain that our offer remains the same. If you are unhappy with the above offer, regrettably, a phone conversation is no longer necessary. They point blank ignore questions and complaints and just repeat themselves. I never want to fly with them again and now have a non-transferable voucher for their services that they think is compensation when really it just means more money spent on Etihad. Lastly, they turn off their entertainment screens 30 mins before landing."

G Johnson",Boeing 787,20th March 2019,Business,Business Class,Abu Dhabi to Brisbane,March 2019,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,1,no,1, I flew Business Class on Etihad flight EY484 from Abu Dhabi to Brisbane [12th March 2019]. The Business Class experience with Etihad was extremely poor and stressful. The cabin crew were less than helpful. The cabin manager introduced herself but gave no advice on how to operate the seat or any of its features especially as the seat mechanism was different to business class seats on other airlines. The flight departed late in the day from Abu Dhabi and so the cabin crew were serving meals virtually from the time the aircraft left the ground but I was kept waiting for my first course until the crew was dimming lights and putting everyone to sleep. The steak was uncooked and blood oozing from the meat was turning the potato dish pink. I tried to contact the cabin crew but they said they were too busy and would come back to me later but they did not. I persisted as I was hungry and when I complained I was told that chocolate ice cream only was available which basically was my dinner that night as everything else had gone. I wasn’t given any other food until breakfast was served. I was unfamiliar with the mechanism for turning this type of seat into a bed - the upholstery was so hard that I got virtually no sleep. I complained to Etihad and received an unsympathetic reply. My purpose in writing this review is to warn other passengers who may want to fly with this airline that they should brace themselves for some very poor service.

I can only surmise that the 5 star rating for Etihad relates to its Premium and higher class products. Ecomony is no greater shakes and I'd strongly say from experience that Emirates and Qatar do a better job. We flew from Mumbai,  the A320 plane cabin looked tired and beige and brown not the most uplifting of decor. Professional staff but only two cabin crew to a whole section of economy seats were kept busy. Professional if a little distant . Would two staff cope in an emergency ? Boarding was something of a rushed affair but I noted that staff do assist confused passengers and with storing and organising bags in the lockers. Trolley service was followed by a very nice chicken curry, not so nice salad but jolly tasty pudding, no cheese and crackers and no hot towels before or after. No menu card either which are handy when passing across multi lingual passengers i.e. What is paneer? Reply, Well, its paneer ! Smooth flight, bilingual announcements. On arrival very poor assistance with transfers although ground staff met the plane, no interaction with transfer guests was noted. Flight to London was better. More cabin crew, attentive, professional but same meal plan, no menu card., no cheese and crackers and availability of wine with meal was obscure. I've never had a vodka and orange with dinner before. Washroom had no water supply. Deal fare was very good value."

Worst customer service at the boarding pass counter. It all started at counter where i was waiting to get my boarding pass with my infant. One staff offered me to join the business class line to get my pass quickly as he noticed my pregnancy and my cranky child and the fact that i was travelling by myself. I appreciated his gesture. But at the business class counter I was told told that i had an overweight baggage of 2 kilos on which i decided to get rid of the extra kilos, so i left the queue. After returning to the counter back I waied patiently for 40 min. That is when i got upset and raised my voice to say even i was a paid passenger and had solved the baggage weight issue so if he could please issue my boarding pass. Then they decided to check weights of all the bags and i had to pay extra for a couple of kilos.  The airline should look for some polite and well mannered people to serve at the counters. This incident was a nightmare."

Still, I was not allowed boarding because of overbooking? I was not given any explanation or whatsoever for I why could not fly despite having a confirmed ticket and having arrived 3 hours before departure! what kind of service is this? I cannot trust this company anymore. Because of them, I missed an important conference. I was given a ridiculous compensation of 300USD which sounds like a joke. I do not recommend this company to anyone, especially if you are traveling for business. They are not reliable anymore and they have zero respect for customers."

D Nasendra",Boeing 787-9,15th March 2019,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Abu Dhabi to Melbourne,March 2019,3.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,,1,no,1,"  I recently flew Etihad from Abu Dhabi to Melbourne and was extremely disappointed with their service. Their standards fell well below that of other airlines, especially Emirates. This 5-Star airline has evidently cut costs in all areas of their service, including their menu (e.g. the breakfast tray only has your meal of choice and a small fruit box). Passengers were encouraged to instead purchase food items from Etihad's overpriced ""Choose Well"" menu (see image). 3 hours into the 14 hours, the FA's decided to lazily lock 2 of the toilets that were messy to prevent them from being used instead of clean them. In-flight Wi-fi was available albiet only for 30 minutes after take-off and 30 minutes before landing. Considering the price you pay (US$30 and capped at just 100mB) I found this to be shameful. Emirates on the other hand charge you $15 for the entire duration of the flight and I had internet access for almost the entire flight. Etihad's prices are not competitive enough to justify such an appalling experience."

Not quite up to the standard of my previous Etihad flight a fortnight previous but not dreadful either. Check-in fine. Etihad use the generic lounge at Bangkok which, by current standards, is basic. More seriously, few if any power sockets. Fortunately power available on the aircraft. Boarding and takeoff delayed 45 minutes due to the tardy removal of the previous flight from the gate, as well explained by the pilot; few minutes late arriving. Crew attentive, regularly passing through the cabin with water and responding to ad-hoc drink requests. Also efficiently dealt with a medical emergency though the unfortunate lady's violent bout of vomiting may have had something to do with the food which, if she had the same meal as I, was grim; far too heavily spiced and quite inedible. Plenty of movies but nothing to see. Etihad offers little in the way of 'Hollywood classics' to pass the time. Deplaned through a gate rather than by bus, a rare event at Abu Dhabi airport. Bags promptly delivered."

Reviewing Etihad presents a problem: Do you benchmark against what was provided before the austerity programme implemented by the current management, or do you assess on the basis on what is available now in comparison to recent performance? In this case, the latter As a Gold Card holder who's been using Etihad for the past decade, there is little doubt austerity has taken its toll. Those little extras that were long one have long gone. However, based on my albeit limited sample, quality has stabilized. For UAE-based customers at least, Etihad's fares are substantially lower than Emirates. And if the company isn't paying, price trumps all else. The flight was unremarkable. A bus was used for boarding, actually preferable in a cool winter's evening as it prevents the crush as the aircraft entrance. Departure was a little delayed with around an hour sat on the tarmac going nowhere, however arrival was 20 minutes ahead of schedule the bags delivered immediately immigration was cleared, which never takes long in Singapore. The economy section was barely half full offering plenty of room. The special meal ordered - asian vegetarian - was passed around without the offer a drink; as always,paneer curry, daal and rice - it never varies. No breakfast only an unappetizing roll; better if they hadn't bothered. Movie selection on the IFE was a bit thin but I love the live TV feature, even if the football match being shown was rubbish - at least it sent me to sleep. To dispel criticism often levied at Etihad, the IFE was activated within 15 minutes of boarding and remained available, other than the obligatory adverts, almost to the arrival gate at Singapore. Whether the disco lighting is a feature of the 787 or a local initiative of the crew, a nice touch to relax the atmosphere on board.. Crew were attentive though loved to gossip - I was close to the rear galley."

I will not use this airline again. I don’t recommend Etihad and will personally stay away. They charge up to 30€ for your online check-in, because they charge you for the seats you choose. This is not acceptable. For the first flight, it was mandatory for me to show my payment card at the counter, so online check-in was off the table anyway. It’s probably some law or security measure, but inconvenient nonetheless. In addition, Etihad has sent me at least 20 Spam E-Mails. I want to know which genius in this company thought it would be a great idea and a sure way to convince people to upgrade to Business class, if you spam their E-Mail Account. Just stop sending E-Mails. Flights were alright, second leg was delayed by 3hrs and I was not able to choose the seat that I wanted. They ran out of beer on the second leg, too. Not that it matters that much, but a little inconvenient. I am tall, and legspace is a big issue. Seats with more legroom (i.e. emergency exit) cost about 130€ (for my booking class). Anyhow, seats are very uncomfortable, because of the back pocket in the seat in front of you. It is huge, it is sharp, it is right where my knee caps are and stuffed full of unnecessary advertisements and other stuff that no one needs. Food was good."

My husband and I have been flying with Etihad for the past few years, we both noticed the quality drop year by year. This time was our last time to give it try, we have been on both economy cabin and business cabins with them many times. I'm mainly sharing the lounge service in this review, cause it's important for an airline to make a good first impression to their client. We were quite disappointed with Etihad, we will fly with different airline the next time. We flew from BKK - London Via Abu Dhabi, round trip. 18 Dec 2018 to London, Jan 6 2019 back in BKK. We were extremely disappointed by the lounge where Etihad assigned in BKK airport, EY407 departs from BKK to AUH at 01:55am, we got to the airport around 11pm, after pass security and everything, we wanted to go to the lounge for some rest, Etihad don't have their own lounge in BKK, they are just the normal Miracle Lounge which anyone can pay THB1000 to get in. The lounge was horrible, not enough seats, horrible food and service. So we started our trip with a bad taste, when reach AUH, this airport is always so messy, the lounge is ok at AUH since it's Etihad's hub. Now let's talk about check in and lounge at Heathrow. Even budget airlines in Asia has better service than Etihad, the check in was so bad that the business class counter staff are all not paying any attention or care to you, instead they were chatting and laughing. The lounge, ok Etihad lounge at Heathrow terminal 4, near gate 10 this lounge's service ranked the worst lounge on my list. The receptionist lady was super moody, didn't say hi or whatever, all servicing staff were gossipy while walking pass you, not trying to provide any help. The only good staff were the bartender who was trying to make some effort! Come on, Etihad, make some training to your staff! On board service at least is ok, food really is a so so though. Most of the food seemed been packaged a long time ago, not fresh at all.  Time to move on, Etihad please do a better job!"

However she said I know what you have been told wasn't right and didn't accept to provide any written confirmation that I am allowed only 30kg. Etihad Airways charged me almost $900 additional weight - I have to pay because there was no time to negotiate as the flight was about to close.

I fly with Etihad long haul about 6 or 7 times a year. The improvement I see is in staff and the consumables at the seat and the general service level - staff moral is good. I have not traveled in Economy with Etihad for at least 5 years so I can only comment on the Business and First experience and that is much better than it was but not quite as good as I remember it to be before - still much better than other airlines I travel on.

Etihad Airways has really declined in service. I flew 6 months ago to Europe with them and they were very courteous and helpful. We even had our own sleep masks and toothbrush to make the whole journey a little more bearable. My only negative at the time was that my luggage had been damaged during transit and when I tried to follow up with them they had so many hurdles to try to jump through to make a claim that in the end it became too difficult to seek compensation whilst being abroad. 6 months later I chose to fly with them again as I was fairly happy with the service. However this time it was not a pleasant experience. There were no masks or toothbrushes on either flight. In fact we were lucky to even get headphones for the service. Someone came around to ask us if we wanted them and I apparently missed when this happened. The toilets were fairly dirty and smelly. The plane was also so hot that myself and several other passengers were trying to fan themselves throughout the flight. I could have flown on a much cheaper airline to have the same standards. I am not sure I will ever fly with Etihad again."

Bryan Carpenter",,14th January 2019,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Bangkok to London via Abu Dhabi ,January 2019,3.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,,1,no,4,"  Original ticket was from Chiang Mai to Bangkok and then from Bangkok to Abu Dhabi and Abu Dhabi to London. I booked my ticket many months in advance, Initiallly searched through Skyscanner and then through Go to Gate. After booking the ticket but before the flight I moved from Chiang Mai to Hua Hin. I assumed that as I had already paid for the Chiang Mai to Hua Hin flight it would be ok if I boarded at Bangkok to start the journey (I was wrong). When I arrived to check in at Bangkok I was informed by the check in clerk that all my tickets had been cancelled (including the return leg) because I did not board at Chiang Mai and if I wanted to travel I would have to pay a cancellation fee, an admin fee and pay to rebook all my tickets. I called the customer service desk at Etihad who told me that not only was the case but as my tickets were cancelled the plane at all stages was now full and I could not rebook onto my original flights (This was not true). This was told to me in a manner where the customer services clerk (on the phone) could hardly contain his eagerness to give me the bad news. I am a 73 years old pensioner travelling business class for the first time because of health reasons to visit my daughters and granddaughter for Christmas. I had already paid around 2,000 pounds for my ticket and now had to pay a further 1,500 pounds because I had missed a one hour internal flight. The money paid to rebook was money that I had set aside for Christmas presents and for holiday expenses. I was informed by the clerk that even if I had cancelled the internal flight all the other flights would also have been cancelled due to my booking having linked journeys and consequently it was classified as one ticket. I contacted Etihad to try to obtain a full or part refund but my request was denied. I wrote a letter (e mail) of appeal but that was not even acknowledged. I am totally disgusted and dismayed by Etihad and I will never fly with Etihad ever again."

Etihad had a significant change since my last trip with them 6 years ago. The online check-in process won't allow me to check-in as I need to choose a seat which isn't free and I can't complete my check-in without choosing a seat. This means that I had to check-in at the airport on the day I travelled. The check-in progress was fairly fast as there was no queue at the airport and staff at the check-in counter choose a seat for me and my sisters for free as I need to took care them for a whole flight. Boarding progress was organized as the crew called passengers by zone. The aircraft on first leg (A330) was old but the cabin was modern and clean. The seat I sit was at the front on the middle of the aircraft which had terrible leg room and uncomfortable, luckily I sit on an aisle seat but still interrupted by people walking pass through. After take off, a meal was served and I choose chicken. There was 3 options but it could be better if the crew handed out the menu. The food was fine but the rice was sticky. The toilet on an aircraft was modern and well designed but wet and small. I sleep through this flight as i was an overnight flight and didn't have time to look on In-flight Entertainment. The flight was delayed and arrived at Abu Dhabi late which I had shorter connection time. The security control of the airport was a fast but crowded. As I don't have a second boarding pass I need to collect one from transfer desk but the staff at the line said I should head to gate as my flight to London start boarding. I collect my boarding pass (including my sisters) at the gate. The staff was helpful and professional but the progress was disorganized. I boarding on time into my second flight (A380) which had a modern and clean cabin. The seat was huge and got lots of legroom but still uncomfortable. The flight departed on time. The food on this flight is better than the previous one. The toilet is bigger but had the same issue as previous flight. The IFE had wide selections of films, TV shows, games etc. The crew was helpful, friendly and professional. Some stuff like amenity kit or little snack must be paid which I think it was unacceptable. The flight arrived at Heathrow on time at terminal 4 which is old and small. In conclusion, Etihad provided a good service on both flights but there still some areas of improvement to compete with major rivals."

Having water on a flight is a basic right for passengers, but was denied water while in this dilapidated Boeing 777-300 from Etihad. Cabin crew was too lazy to put water into my own water bottle, and told me that she would do in her way back - walked past me as if nothing happened. Same woman, for the second said again that she‘d get back to me - she was collecting rubbish and had water in trolley, again she didn’t. Finally got water, but was being served as if I was demanding for champagne. Food was disgusting.

Online booking is open 48 hours, where you can check-in but cannot select a seat. That can only done 24 hr before. However if you check 48-24 hrs before you will not be able to change the seat allocated at check-in. SO really if you want to choose your own seat, you should only check in 5-24 hrs before. Not clear at all when checking in. Secondly I could not check in for the connecting sector. I had to do it in stages within the time limits even though it was one booking, which I could not as I would have been travelling at that time because of the large waiting period. The passenger sitting next to me on the flight from London to Abu Dhabi was rather large and something needs to be done about this. I was uncomfortable (even though I am small) and she must have been too as I was only able to use 75% of my seat comfortably. My return trip's baggage allowance was 23kg, whereas it was 30kg going out. My error in not noticing this but it does seems rather banal and even ticketing my agent had not noticed because nobody drew his attention to it. I believe this should be not allowed unless it is pointed out clearly (in Bold) when booking. Lastly on my return while I was able to successfully check-in and select my seat on BKK-AUH sector, I could not just do it for the AUH-LHR sector, so I ended up getting middle seat, which I find difficult."

There was literally a protest around one member of the ground team as it seems that Etihad Airways just are just too good at messing up such simple tasks it’s become part of their reputation, please do not choose this airline."

The security was tight at Cairo which is reassuring. It was a slow check-in process at Cairo. The lounge at Cairo used by Etihad was the Pearl lounge, which was fine and nice coffee and cakes plus hot food. A private booth chair and TV. The flight was after midnight and full. Nice staff but busy. Also nowhere to hang my overcoat as the wardrobe was full. Good service, good food and arrived on time into Abu Dhabi at 06:20. I made my way to the Lounge for my next flight to Dublin. I decided to take advantage of the Spa and had a massage of my back and feet. Great massage cost 30 - 40 euro. Took at least 40 minutes. Great way to spend your time between flights. I felt refreshed and had a glass of champagne before boarding my next flight. Again the flight was full and busy, but the staff were excellent. High quality food and wine. One problem I find with these pod type seats they're too restricted for my shoulders or to get comfortable in the flat bed position. They are fine for sitting up and eating. But the older style business class without pod seats are much more spacious and more comfortable then this walled in type seat. Other than that a pleasant flight. I arrived back in Dublin on time."

Staff was professional and helpful. 2nd flight from Abu Dhabi to Los Angeles I was in economy, no upgrade on this flight. The seat was pretty comfortable. Enough legroom, space to stretch legs; I'm 5'10 and I found it good enough. The seat itself was comfortable as well. The cabin crew made the flight painless, smiling and accommodating guests. When I asked for something they made sure I got it. Very professional. Etihad always highlight their premium cabins and products. So when booking a flight on Etihad, travelers expect that service and quality, but after booking the flight You can't select seats unless you pay for them. The flights seem to be overbooked, that leads to having no overhead luggage space, which is something you'd expect on a budget airline, not a premium airline. Also the cabin layout is very cramped and has incredibly small aisles, similar to a budget airlines. Overall I would recommend this airline."

I started flying with them in 2006 and became one of their first 800 gold members back then. Back then, it was obvious that the majority of the people I dealt with at Etihad did not care. They were among the worst airlines I flew with at multiple levels. They brag about new aircraft but nothing else. I stopped flying with them in 2009. Recently, I started flying with the them just because their tickets for my routes were the cheapest. I made it to Gold again this year but unfortunately, if anything, the airline staff, policies, and overall experience only got worse, if that is even possible. I can't start to describe the lack of courtesy they show to their guests, and continuous lies they keep making. They really do not need to think out of the box, their neighbors in Dubai run a very successful airline. They just need to copy them! Frequent travelers are never made to feel special, and their loyalty program hardly offers any benefits."

S Pallera",,20th December 2018,Business,Business Class,Manila to Rome via Abu Dhabi,November 2018,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,1,no,1,"  On 29 August 2018, I purchased a business lass ticket on Etihad to travel Manila to London with departure on 5 November at 5h55 pm and London to Manila with departure on 19 November. On 18 October, I called Etihad to have the ticket changed to Manila to Rome with departure on 5 November at 5h55 and unchanged return from London. For that change I was charged USD 209, which seems reasonable. On 5 November, my connecting flight to Manila, bought separately on Cebu Pacific, was cancelled due to heavy rains. I called Etihad and agreed with the Customer service that my ticket would be changed to “open”, as it was uncertain, when I would reach Manila. I arrived at Etihad’s check-in counter on 5 November at 9 pm. There I was told that I had two options for rebooking. I could travel departing Manila on 5 November at 11 pm, or the next day. In either case, the charge for changing my booking would be more than USD 2000, a few 100 USD less, if I would take the flight on 6 November. I decided to opt for departing on 5 November at 11 pm. For this change, I was charged USD 2594.70 plus USD 20. I accepted the charge, only expressing my surprise, because there was no time to lose to catch the flight departing at 11 pm. After my return, I received by email a questionnaire asking me to rate Etihad based on my travel experience. I of course gave the lowest rate. The system asked, if I wanted to submit a complaint, so I did that. The response from Etihad “Guest relations” was: “I have reviewed your booking to check the specific rules for your ticket, and can see the ticket you purchased was priced for firm travel dates. This was highlighted clearly during the ticket purchase process. As a result, your ticket is not applicable for a free waiver on your booked flights. Upon your call and request to exchange your ticket to the new chosen dates you had to pay the applicable fee and fare difference.” I replied pointing out that there had not been any change of date: I left Manila on 5 November and arrived Madrid on 6 November. Through several emails I requested a proper explanation for the very high charge. In response I received the following message from Etihad “Guest relations”: “Thank you for your reply. In my previous email I had explained you in detail, when you exchange your ticket to another date or flight that the applicable fare difference and change penalty fee needs to be paid. The fare rules of your originally purchased ticket were disclosed to you at the time of booking and send to you in a confirmation email. Unfortunately I am unable to reimburse you for the fees you had to pay.” Thus, a polite request for an explanation of extraordinarily high charge for changing a ticket is met with an explanation, which is not valid, being based on the incorrect postulate of change of date.

It was a long and tiring flight. We carried along five baggages. We were the last to collect our baggage inspite of having priority privileges. We later realized one baggage was missing. I reported this at the lost baggage counter whereby i was given a small note and promised that they have traced it and will send it to the hotel in Dubai where we were staying in the next 24hrs. It has now gone beyond one week. My kids have no clothes to change to and this has forced us to spend money out of our budget to buy few clothes for them. Attempts to call the airline as well as sending email seemed futile. Email not answered and airline taking no responsibility with people tossing us from one office to another. This is being very unfair. I now intend to travel to Abu Dhabi from Dubai to resolve the matter leaving my kids in the hotel. What a time waste. Officials from the airline need to get serious with their jobs. I have travelled many places in the world and this has never happened. What a shame!

I am never flying with Etihad Airways again. I am giving Etihad a 2/10 because of their inability to properly handle my baggage. I paid almost $2000 to fly from New York to Mumbai (return trip), and the least I expect is to have my checked-in baggage reach along with me (as anyone would expect). Butthis is not what happened. I checked-in two bags at JFK, but only one of them made it to Mumbai. I was told the other one was stuck in Abu Dhabi. Another staff member told me that it seems that it is still at JFK airport. The tracking number they gave me did not work either (it kept showing “tracking continues”- all in all, an utterly useless response). There have been 6 additional flights from Abu Dhabi to Mumbai after I arrived and yet my bag seems to be nowhere near me. As I am writing this review, it has been nearly 36 hours since I arrived and yet my bag can not be tracked. I have come home to see my family and friends for 2 weeks (after a year of being away) and my short vacation is being ruined because I am constantly anxious about my luggage and am fearing the worst. I suspect that Etihad staff at some point (either at JFK or Abu Dhabi) was negligent and left didn’t load my luggage. It is beyond infuriating to know that even after paying $2000, this is the kind of treatment a customer receives. It’s 2018. We have sent humans to the moon and beyond, and yet this incompetent company called Etihad Airways has failed to successfully deliver my baggage to me. I have recommended Etihad Airways to my friends and family in the past because they usually have comfortable flights and good food. But, this incident is unacceptable to me. I shall be avoiding Etihad Airways completely and will never be flying with this company again."

Clint Baker",,16th December 2018,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Abu Dhabi to Sydney,November 2018,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,3,no,1," My wife and I travelled from Australia to Rome return, via Etihad's hub in Abu Dhabi. As we had discovered on the earlier sectors it is not unusual for Etihad to split up families even when they are booked together, we had paid the roughly 40 Euros to grab a couple of seats in a twin row, so that we would have aisle access for the six hour plus Abu Dhabi to Sydney sector. (there are no free seat selection options). I also placed a NZD195 bid on a neighbour free seat on the understanding that should the bid be successful we would forfeit our 40 Euros. And then, with just on twenty-four hours till check-in I was emailed that our bid for the neighbour free seat NFS had been successful. So far so good! Upon boarding at Abu Dhabi we were surprised to find that the entire economy section appeared full. These extra bookings must have occurred during the twenty-fours hours immediately prior to take off, (who would have imagined) for them to have accepted my (minimum) bid for a NFS. The hostess was pleasant enough and checked all the seating allocations and the passengers were all in their correct seats, and our two originally selected seats were also allocated. (not to us) OK, so stuff happens sometimes! Now I imagined that I should be entitled to a refund of my NZD195 as I had not received a NFS and the 40 Euro seat selection charge as we hadn't received those either. And this is when the fun started, it is all but impossible to get through to Etihad. The one call I successfully made to our nearest call centre (in Australia from New Zealand) I received advice to email. Emails received replies to leave messages on Facebook. Messages left on Facebook received automatic responses that I should expect replies within twenty eight days. So, here we are more than a month after the flight, still waiting for Etihad to respond. Interesting note: Etihad's Facebook page is full of complaints from people who have unresolved complaints. Next time, before I choose an airline to send my money to, I will check their Facebook page for an up to date idea of their service / customer relations rather than a year old survey."

My daughter and I travelled from Brisbane to London in economy and returned a week later. The aircraft we travelled in were a Boeing 787 and an Airbus A380. Firstly, the 787 is a simple yet beautiful aircraft and the layout seemed adequate for a 14 hour flight. The seats are comfortable and offer a great recline. The in-flight entertainment was adequate if nothing extraordinary and was enough to keep a nine year old and a 40 year old entertained for a total of 40 or so hours flying. The A380 was in my opinion slightly more comfortable and appeared to have more room. My issue with Etihad is not with the aircraft however it is with the additional costs. I have flown over the years extensively with airlines such as QANTAS, British Airways, Singapore Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Korean Air, KLM and Garuda Indonesia. On these airlines, I have never, room permitting, been requested to pay USD$330 for my daughter and I to experience greater leg room in an exit row. In fact on the aforementioned ‘other’ airlines I have in fact been offered a seat with greater leg room (I am a tall man) or upon request, room permitting have been allocated a roomier seat. I have come to expect, despite the fact that I am an economy passenger, that these small but meaningful gestures from an airline and their staff are a standard when it comes to flying on a premium airline. The service was inconsistent. Some okay, some kind of interested and others seemingly annoyed by your presence. Don’t expect any initiative of any sort. Etihad has proven me wrong. I pre-selected my seats using the Etihad app which I was prompted to do on numerous occasions before all flights. I did select my economy seats however was told at check in that For whatever reason, the seats that I had selected were not the seats I had been allocated. I was however informed that for £490 I could ‘upgrade’ to exit row seats for both flights home. I politely declined and politely exclaimed how ridiculous the suggestion was. After a 6.5 hour flight from London and facing a 13.5 hour flight to Brisbane, my daughter and I had 45 minutes to negotiate Abu Dhabi’s security checks with a thousand other people all massed together like Sardines. Then rushed to our connecting flight and discovered that we were wedged in to another tight row crowded with similarly discontented passengers. I gave in and paid a total of $443 AUD to have my daughter and I seated in an exit row aisle. I will not travel Etihad again. I will happily pay three or four hundred extra dollars and fly with a carrier that doesn’t pretend to be classy but just is."

One thing that needs to be addressing I feel based on both flights & is a dangerous precedent that seems to be on the increase is the continued use of mobiles phones whilst taking off and landing. My first flight from Bahrain to Abu Dhabi on take off had a guy who was still talking on his mobile phone, even after the normal warnings issued by the crew! Then landing you can see folk starting texting and this was so evident on both flights. This is safety violations but as the crew are already in their seats none of them can see what’s going on in the cabin. The use of mobiles on take off & landing must be enforced & not one crew member is doing anything to stop what is becoming an epidemic on the most dangerous part of a flight take off & landing... apart from this observation both crews were attentive and one crew member on The Melbourne flight  from Serbia deserves special mention as she did take great care of me even if I slept most of the flight. Makes a nice change when a crew member makes a great effort & goes above the normal of what’s expected from a crew member. Need more of her type in the skies. The IFE seems to have improved as a lot better choice of films were very evident so Etihad must keep it up. WiFi need big improvement inflight though as connection just keeps getting disconnected many times. A pretty enjoyable flight this time around though."

Worst Customer Service Center I have  dealt with. My parents fly with Etihad Airways every year to Australia. Called customer service last August for my elderly parents who were trying to keep their air miles. They couldn’t fly last year due to health reason but in july 2017 they wanted to book Dec 2018 in order to save their airmiles. There was no flights available as it was too far out. When we explained it, we were told there was nothing we could do. Sept this year my mom gets a call from Etihad that she answered on her hands free as she was driving. She was told that they cancelled her return flight back to the UK and would she accept another flight back. She cooperated and said yes only to find out that the details of the new flight means she has to get a taxi to airport $90 and a hotel. She was quite distraught. I called and explained to be told that she agreed, therefore there was nothing that she could do. I asked to speak to a manager. I got a call from a supervisor. She couldn’t help, so I asked to speak to a manager. I was told on Sept 20th that a manager would call me and still haven’t heard from them. After complaining I was promised another call at 2pm. I then received an email at 3:20pm stating they couldn’t reach me. 3.5months later still trying to talk to a manager. This is my parents last flight with Etihad."

We live in Abu Dhabi really do not have any alternative to using this airline even though Etihad never fails to surprise me in the myriad of weird and wonderful ways it can think of to treat its customers badly and this flight was no surprise. I booked my ticket on the Etihad website; it had an Etihad flight number EY7854; I paid my money to Etihad. Then, we were not able to select a seat or check in online. So we went to Abu Dhabi airport early to select seats together and to enjoy dinner and a drink in the first class lounge only to find we were denied entry to the lounge because it was not an Etihad operated flight, but Middle East Airlines! We were told this was due to some contract between Etihad and MEA and that the information was available on the website (not true). When we left and were about 4 yards away, I turned around and saw that the lounge manager and door attendant were laughing at us - we are repeat customers - we are travelling again in December, January and February. Etihad do not let their customers, loyal or otherwise, ever have a win. You cannot select a seat in advance without paying about 1/3 of the original price extra even if you are a gold or platinum frequent flyer; they will separate you and your husband when it comes to their seat allocation; you only get one meal on the flight and that is served at inappropriate times so that if you have a flight of over 4 hours you arrive hungry; and all of this is on top of the creaky old planes with their ugly brown livery and small, narrow seats with minimum leg room. I don't know why anyone ever chooses Etihad."

Again another 8 phone calls to their call centre 5 I was hung up on within the first sentence to three others who placed me on hold for over 10 minutes to revert with a price on change to my ticket for the return leg, a Flex ticket to be told three different prices, all of which were higher that the original ticket being a ticket cost 1300 Eur to then ask for 1400 Euro for date change. While checking their website a brand new return ticket in the same class would cost me 900 euro. The mind boggles how this is calculated. Etihad need to get your act together. This combined with trying to have your miles credited correctly ever time you take a flight."

Good: Check-in open at least 4 hours prior to the flight. Not busy, efficiently processed and retired to the generic airport lounge used by Etihad for shower and change of clothes though somewhat lacking in facilities otherwise; very limited choice of food particularly for vegetarians and vegans. Flight not that busy, empty seat alongside which makes a big difference. Staff friendly and swiftly dealt with a conflict over seating without making a drama; a largish family group determined to take matters into their own hands to ensure they all sat together irrespective of the allocated seats. Drinks immediately served on departure followed by the meal - a vegetarian option for myself. Arrival in Abu Dhabi a few minutes ahead of schedule. Not so good: The aircraft was one of, if not the oldest 777 in the Etihad fleet and did it show. The brown interior decor favoured by Etihad never looked great but is now hopelessly dated and compares poorly to other airlines. There was no live TV available; generally Etihad's IFE is markedly substandard in comparison to other airlines, including low-cost carriers. Very disappointing on what should be a flagship long-haul service. Whether this was a function of the aircraft's age or a change of policy is not known, Likewise poor show for the failure of the crew to recognize that I'm a Gold Card holder. Finally, there is the near obligatory delight of being crammed into a bus for the grand tour of the wilds of Abu Dhabi airport on arrival - at least the buses turned up this time, unlike a previous occasion. So doing simply undermines the positive impression of the service offered at the departure airport."

Not only have I been ripped off incredibly by paying over $2000 AUD for a return flight (paid in October 2017), for seat check in, I needed to pay for the seat reservation. Are you kidding me? This was never something I needed to do with this airline. Also, on my way to Jordan (back in June 2018), I was not told about the recent luggage allowance change from 30 to only 23, which came into effect Jan this year. I was only 1.5kgs over by accident and the rude lady at the counter charged me 2kg excess. Why not charge only for 1.5kg? Why round it up? Couldn’t she have just given me a break and either round down to 1lg excess or none at all? Absolutely fuming at this airline carrier. Not recommending or flying with them ever again."

Economy class. The flight from Bangkok to Abu Dhabi (Boeing 777-300) was in my estimation no more than 75% full and took off within a few minutes of the scheduled departure time; arrived on time. Excellent service from the ground staff and from the flight crew on the plane. Liquid refreshments (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic) served regularly during the flight. Food was ""satisfactory"" although not as good as it was when I last flew Etihad six years previously (it was then outstanding). Entertainment availability was fine although more restricted than on some of the other Middle East airlines. Airport facilities at Abu Dhabi (both seating accommodation and available shopping facilities) much improved according to my recollection. From Abu Dhabi to London Heathrow (Airbus A380 - world's best aircraft for passenger experience, in my opinion) the flight appeared to be very close to fully booked and departure was delayed for around 30 minutes to allow boarding by passengers from a connecting flight that had been delayed - this a positive rather than a negative feature to my mind. Arrival at London was nevertheless on time to within a few minutes. My return to Etihad was largely as a result of the extremely competitive price offered for the (return) flight ticket. If the pricing and standard of service can be maintained I foresee that Etihad will become and remain my airline of choice for the time being."

November isn’t high season in Europe and one can only hope that long haul international flights aren’t full. Each of my Etihad flights were fantastic due mainly to the planes being half empty. All economy passengers had either a row to themselves or at least a spare seat in between each other. My husband and sons each flew different Etihad flights from Brisbane to Rome in November and experienced the same. Also, the interconnecting flights were less than two hours. The meals are small but tasty enough served with complimentary alcoholic beverages. Super impressed and highly recommend Etihad in low season."

Counter staff in BLR made a fuss about 1 kilo of excess weight on the hand baggage. I never want to fly with them ever. Better to use the European airlines as the experience is much better."

We flew Business Class from Sydney to Casablanca via Abu Dhabi. We were looking forward to experiencing a flight on Etihad. As frequent travellers we like to try different airlines. The reality was horrible. Really bad food - on the really long journey I was served an egg white omelet on the first flight and some appalling canned pumpkin soup on the 2nd leg. No other food was offered. The staff seemed to spent most of the flight gossiping in the galley oblivious to passengers. By the time I was dumped into the awful waiting room at Casablanca airport I was hungry. The wines were not up to business class standard. The seat was uncomfortable - ditto with the 'bed' and the amenities pack sub-standard. The worst aspect of both flights were the stinking toilets. They really smelt bad. Please can someone get into the toilets with hot soapy water and disinfectant and clean them? Is this too much to expect in a business class cabin? I have written to Etihad to complain as we are dreading the return trip. I got a response full of business jargon - a response which completely ignored my customer experience. Once Etihad has the customer's money, they just don't care. Their business class service is appalling and not worth the money. "

Even if I am tall (1.95m), the existing seat space was correct for the flight duration (8h + 6h). Good inflight entertainment. Meals were ok in terms of quantity/quality. Tickets price was the lowest I have ever seen for long haul flights! Some points to be noted: IFE was shut down 1h before landing and earphones collected directly (is that the purpose?). It is not the case on the other airlines. Every time a passenger or a kid call the steward via the button it rings very loud on speaker or headphones. Staff was professional but not specially friendly. Too much plastics used for glasses for the different services (water, dinner, break etc)."

And during hot meal service she looked at me and just ignored me, later on another flight attendant came and asked what do I prefer.  During my journey I flew with 6 different airlines and I must say that Etihad Airways was the worst. Turkish Airlines and Qatar Airways was way more better.

Initially, when we tried to book this stopover the price of the flights had gone up which meant a flight difference fee in addition to the change fee. The agent then advised us to wait and to see if the fare dropped so we could match what we paid. It did, and so we rang Etihad to book our stopover. We were genuinely shocked to be told that to change the one leg of our flight would cost an incredible €2,300 each! We were fully aware that there would be a change fee, no issue there. But to be told that our ticket would be cancelled and new ticket issued was ridiculous. This just cannot be correct. However, I recieved a call from Etihad and the agent said the fees to change were correct. No wonder Etihad are in trouble because now I am on for Emirates/Qatar/Turkish and Etihad have lost a loyal business class passenger."

This was quite a modern flight with inflight entertainment, clean and charging points.  We paid online for preferred seats as we were traveling with Kids and an elderly lady. Our seat allocation was six in a row. (3 in the right wing and 3 in the Isle). However when we boarded the flight the front 3 seats were vacant where my kids were seated, and therefore for easy communication I requested to move to the vacant seat(both in the Economy class) after it was announced that the flight was about to take off. However a member of the cabin crew mentioned that the passengers are still boarding and they will have to see whether the seat would fall vacant (I was surprised). However after I heard the final announcement that the flight was to take off, I moved to the seat in front where the kids were seated because I was sure that the doors were closed. I was then taken again by surprise when another crew member came and insisted me to get back to my original seat and I would be given the first preference if no passenger has booked that seat(strange how the passengers could enter with closed doors). However the flight took off with the seats still vacant but after about 25 minutes a passenger came right from the back and occupied the seat that I was promised first preference. I thought this was purely impartial treatment to prove a point by purely displaying unprofessionalism and inhuman behaviour the the crew members. To mention few of the other comments; Commercials are played over the public address system - this is not a sponsored journey so please respect others freedom of listening as it is not a safety announcement. No meal preference card in seat pockets or distributed to passengers before meals are served, being a full service flight. Entertainment choices are almost same across all sectors."

This sector was not available for online preferred seats (paid seats) The seats were allocated 2x3 rows for six passengers where three seats were available in the sector. These were system allocated seats. I called the Etihad office in Manchester to change this in to three in a row since we were traveling with Kids. Although the call center officer tried her best to help me, she said I have to get them from the Airport and it should not be an issue. When we reached the Airport we were dissapointed with the attitude of the Ground staff, where the checkin counter officer was rushing us to check in the baggage warning us the counter would be closed in 10 minutes and we would be off loaded (we had 1hr and 20 minutes at this point before departure) This looked like a scam to earn additional money from passengers who are over weight. Since we had little choice to rearrange our baggage, Out of desperation I paid for 5 additional kgs and left two baggages behind. We wouldn't have been over weight if we were not refused a Cabin luggage, mentioning it was oversized to go in as cabin luggage, although it was in the allowed cabin baggage allowance. I wonder why they did not allow the kilos that we were allowed in the refused cabin luggage to be checked in, since they refuse the baggage to be taken in the cabin. Also I was surprised how the same piece of baggage survived two sector belonging to the same Airline when we travelled to Manchester. It was very disappointing to see the treatment of the the other ground staff officer, rushing us to get to the boarding gate although we were traveling with an elderly lady. Finally I had to tell him that I made a request online for Wheel chair assistance where it was never offered to the passenger at check in. When we arrived at the gate, the passengers were still queued up. ""What was the mighty rush my the so call ground staff officer""? The biggest drama was when we boarded the Aircraft. It was hot like a sauna. Most of the lockers were full and I ask one of the cabin crew where could I keep the baggage and she replied ""The flight is full"" with a don't care attitude and just walked away. At that point a kind passenger was helping me to sort out my baggage. When I opened one of the lockers, the cabin member came back and said ""it is understood that the lockers are closed because they are full"" 'Oh Really"" that was news to me having, flown for several years. However the kind passenger (mentioned above)helped me out to sort out my baggage. Since the heat was unbearable, my wife pressed the button for assistance to get some water, but no crew member turned up. But soon I realised that we were not alone since I saw three more illuminated lights calling for assistance where no cabin member turned up. The flight took off around 8.45 PM. Around 9.45 pm we were served with some savoury biscuits (savoury biscuits at that time of the night?) Finally when the Dinner was served, it was 11.15 PM. At least the kids were not served meals on time. Few points to note to the benefit of other passengers- Although this is a long sector only 23kg allowed in Economy. Not a children friendly flight. If you are traveling with children and elderly people, avoid this flight as it is very unlikely that you will get any kind of assistance from the cabin crew. Should also mentioned that the seats were not adjustable although a button exist to do so."

I waited in the queue more than an hour (they had to open more desks as otherwise they wouldn't be on time to close the flight). First person I talked to ask for a flight that shows I am leaving Bali within a month, I completely understand that legally you need it but I explained them I have lived in Bali for 4 years (I showed them all my working permits and stamps) and I am waiting for a new working permit (also you can extend your visa at airport until 60 days so this could be also an option, but not). This person pass me with the manager, I have to wait as she is talking with other passengers, I don't understand why everyone is so tense, crew and passengers but I wait until there is a space for me. After explaining her the same she still requires the ticket and send me to buy it to the front (AirEuropa), they were also busy so I waited, when they were free they told me they don't fly to Bali and can not help me, why do you send me to AirEuropa then? I ended up buying the ticket online close to the crew of Etihad, they knew what I was doing, and when I received the confirmation they said the flight was closed and that i am not considered overbooking like another 5 people because I had no my flight in time. This was the worst treat I ever had, they were so overwhelmed because the company sold more seats than what they should. I followed every step they told me, they knew I was buying the ticket, they knew I live here in Bali and need to fly and still let me out, shameless. When they realised how bad they treated me and how unfair they were, they try to fix it and, of course, Madrid approved to reissue the ticket for the next day, when they were on it the central did not let them reissue, did they even listened to what happened at the airport? I called customer services several times just to be told I have to pay the change plus the no show fee, again, shameless, 500 euros. I ended up buying a new ticket as I would not accept a no show in this situation. Another 580 euros because the airline was too busy to attend properly to the passengers. The day after the crew apologised but nothing else they can do. I already claimed twice and did not even have an answer from them. Terrible customer service, terrible attitude."

My partner had the Pumpkin Pasta which turned out to be under cooked. The Passion Fruit meringue was on a stone hard base. A very disappointing experience.

In addition to that the cabin crew were really impolite and they kept hitting my shoulder as they were walking down the aisle and they didn't even bother to say sorry until I told one of them 'Hey watch it, this is the 3rd time you hit my shoulder' then he looked at me and continued walking? It was a morning flight so breakfast was served and I'm happy as hell that I ate from McDonald's Abu Dhabi airport before I board the plane - the breakfast Etihad served was so atrocious. The in-flight entertainment was mostly old movies and the alcohol served was mainly cheap brands - bconsidering how expensive Etihad flights are in general (around 1000 dollars for an economy seat yet they provide the cheapest alcohol ever). Etihad is a horrible deal with its expensive prices & cheap service onboard and impolite staff - an airline to avoid. I recommend Etihad becomes a low cost carrier with it's extremely bad services both on ground & on air."

Check in staff were OK but there were no proper instructions at the tome of boarding. On board, it seem, the flight crew do not have fine training. There is no menu card and staff did not know what food there were serving. When serving, he asked me if I wanted Chicken or Lamb, so I asked what is the dish and he said in broken English that ""it is like Chicken Pasta & Spicy Lamb"" So my wife & I ordered one each. What we got was tasted like Thai Green Chicken curry with Rice Noodles & Lamb Biriyani. After a 14 Hour flight, 2 hours before landing in Brisbane at 6pm, they started to serve a snack! When asked what it was, he said ""Vegetarian"" & I got a Chocolate Danish Pastry with Custard! The tray was left on our tables until 30 mins before we landed - the whole service was a mess. If I had a choice, I would prefer not to travel with Etihad but if the price is very  cheap, I may be forced to put up with the rubbish or take my own food."

Business, flight was very full - Check In/ Immigration a breeze . New lounge provided by third party is an improvement but food not great, quite basic and ok drinks. Right across from the gate , boarded early and flight on time. This was a 6 hour flight and the crew were average, seemed rushed and not very engaging - did the basics, slow service and lacked previous crews interaction and personal touch. Meal service was ok, a crab starter and a small main course .. wines ok.. though the service started about 2 hours into the flight and took too long a time with courses delayed and empty delph and cutlery left to long to be cleared. Arrived 30 minutes early as mentioned and into a bridge which was a plus. Overall not up to their usual standard and the service appeared unpolished and hassled."

Maria Teresita Samson",,21st September 2018,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Manila via Abu Dhabi,September 2018,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,1,no,3,"  I flew Etihad last 16 September from Frankfurt to Manila via Abu Dhabi. From Abu Dhabi to Manila, that is about more than eight hours (8 hrs) flight. After about forty five minutes of flying, a full meal was served which I am assuming to be breakfast. I chose a chicken with noodles meal. To my surprise, the thin rice noodles contain two small pieces of chicken, and it was extra spicy (which was not mentioned by the stewardess). To top it all, the appetizer was a mixture of some vegetables with the same type of noodles with a sour-sweet-spicy vinaigrette! I did not eat the bread as it is too much for me. I ate a small amount of dessert. Then, more than halfway of the journey, I was getting hungry already (we are above Bangkok). I asked the stewardess if they are serving food again and I was told 'Yes!'. So, the food came and it was a choice between sandwich or noodle in a cup! I told the stewardess I want both as I am too hungry! I was told 'only one, and if there will be extra, I will come back and give you.' The sandwich is a pan with mostly tomatoes (Mexican-type flavor),I ate all of it as I am very hungry. Later, the stewardess came with the same sandwich, and I politely declined. This is more than an eight hour flight, and for passengers two smaller meals will be healthier than one full meal. If you had a breakfast at 9am, after five hours, you will feel hungry, and want your lunch. I just felt Etihad is not sensitive to these passengers. Please be a little generous and give healthy food."

The most pathetic example of customer service I have ever experienced. The cabin crew unfriendly at every interaction giving a general sense of disdain for the passengers on board. Generally confrontational reactions to any request, including hour long waits for additional snacks (we only asked once), refusal to provide additional blankets to children and the elderly passengers. Unable to handle detour, exceptionally poor communication and confrontational staff. The flight could not land due to bad weather. Delays totalling 12 hours were experienced between landing in Toronto and departing Toronto the next day. A total wait in Toronto of 32 hours.  On landing in Toronto, a 5 hour delay during which no food or beverages were given and people were refused blankets because they were “reserved for the next flight”. On entering the airport all passengers were left to fend for themselves. No communication on where to go, who to see or what the detailed plan was. All we knew was that we would be put up in a hotel for the night. On the flight to New York, waiting for 4 hours for a 1 hour flight supposed to depart at 7pm but departed at 11pm. The highlights during this time being a rude “customer service” employee of Etihad making veiled threats to Muslim passengers who were understandably irate (as was everybody else). A pilot who called the police citing unrest on the plane due to many passengers questioning the air hosts about our departure time. We were then fed constant empty promises of departure in 15 minutes from 9pm to 11pm. The food was terrible.  I will never fly Etihad again. The customer service rot at Etihad runs right through the organisation, from the airline staff to the airport customer service staff, the call centre staff and pilots."

After paying close to full price on a couple of business class flights I am left significantly underwhelmed. Today after finishing off a phone call with an Etihad contact centre rep I feel disappointed. Ground staff at Abu Dhabi have been given next to no training in customer service and come across as disinterested at best. Staff barely made eye contact and blunt in their communication and generally obvious that they were unwilling. 2. Contact Centre: downright rude and unhelpful. I didn’t even get to finish a sentence and was ordered to contact my travel agent and then once I somehow managed to correct them (ie that the issue was not travel agent related) was ordered to visit the website to make changes. Website / apps are hopeless. Good luck trying to book a chauffeur service through this portal. Business class seats, now starting to show its age, not as comfortable on long haul as say a Qantas seat even though it looks more flashy. Food is hit and miss, some dishes were ok, some were way overcooked, overall average. In summary I am left considerably underwhelmed. Will be flying Qatar in my next trip who are much better in all the above."

Unfortunately, we got a 2 way ticket and have to return back home via the same airline. However, wouldn’t recommend or travel again with this airline. It was a sad, unexpected experience. Pros: - nothing (all airlines give the basic, infact the service by other airlines even in economy class is commendable) Cons: - a very inconsiderate & mismanaged crew staff (trust me, it matters) - we had opted for a baby bassinet, but after our 2nd layover we had to pay 120euros to get the baby bassinet (no courtesy in their ground staff either) - it would sound funny, but no toy for a baby. It was a first for me. Why choose this airline when there are other better options."

On boarding for the 13 hour flight which departed at 10am I was offered a glass of juice and my meal order was taken. I was told the meal would arrive in a few hours. Soon after take off the cabin crew darkened the window shades indicating they were encouraging passengers to sleep during the day time flight. I would have thought drinks would be offered and served soon after take off however this was not the case. There was no offer of coffee or any other drink. I also thought lunch would arrive around three hours later as promised. Nothing arrived. I didn't mention anything as I know how busy things can be. 7.5 hours after take off I was offered a coffee. Still no meal. I mentioned I was becoming hungry and have waited for my meal. No response. Cabin crew were largely invisible during the entire flight. 11 hours after departure the flight attendant offered me a coffee or pastry which I declined as I said was still waiting to be served lunch. He walked away. Soon after another flight attendant placed a bottle of water on my table and walked away. That’s the limit of inflight service I experienced. There is absolutely no excuse to have to endure a thirteen hour flight without a meal. Surely the flight attendant knew I was not served any food. He took the order. He knew the order was to be served. He knew it was not served. He knew he had not removed any plates from my table. I fly business class between Australia and Europe every year, usually on Etihad. My experience with Etihad is the service is inconsistent at best and to expect little. In thirteen hours I was served only a glass of fruit juice and a bottle of water. This is totally unacceptable in any class of travel. My complaint to Etihad resulted in an offer of 5000 points in their frequent flyer program. I am not a member. I checked and it would offer me a cheap cap for my trouble. Etihad customer relations seems to regard its customers with as much contempt as some of its flight attendants. I have already booked next year's flights to Paris, but with a different airline. Every year with Etihad there's yet another issue."

I really don't understand all the negative reviews here. I have read them all and was preparing for a horrible experience, but Etihad ended up being brilliant, and I can't wait to fly with them again. Moscow - Abu Dhabi flight. I have selected seats online before they discontinued the free seat selection, and surprisingly all my selected seats stayed intact. Check in was quick and orderly, boarding commenced on-time. Our 3-year old Airbus 321 was very comfortable, with wide seats and decent legroom in economy, as well as an updated and fast IFE system. Cabin crew were very pleasant, smiling, well-groomed and efficient. The meal service was without menus, but you could look up the meals for your flight online on Etihad website - it matched 100%. The metal cutlery made the whole experience classy. Meal service included complimentary wines, beers (Stella Artois and Budweiser), gin, whiskey, rum and vodka, plus non-alcoholic beverages. Cabin crew were generous with the drinks, mixing cocktails and giving out extra beer and other drinks to whoever asked them. I had the hindu meal, and it was very filling and healthy. IFE had few movies in Russian, but I guess that is to be expected, but the movie library in English was great and appealed to my taste. When I asked for a beer in the middle of the flight, the cabin crew member gave me two cans, saying ""why have one when you can have two"". Transit in Abu Dhabi was very quick and painless, but I wish we had jet-bridges instead of buses to the terminal. Abu Dhabi - Bangkok boarded via jet bridge, on-time once again. The flight was quite full, but I managed to score an empty seat next to me. Boeing 777-300 is a bit less comfortable than Airbus 321 due to seat width, but the seat pitch is still very much okay, and the experience is still good. The cabin crew passed with towelettes and water before takeoff, which was a very nice touch. IFE was a bit less responsive, but the content was the same. Meal service was amazing, I have never had such delicious dishes on the plane in economy. My hindu meal was simply mouthwateringly delicious, and I wouldn't mind getting this food in a cafe on the ground. My mother had Fish Sayadiah, which was just exceptional as well. Drinks were, once again, poured liberally and generously, with crew making a first full round of drinks with a small savoury snack before the meal, the second one with the meal and once more after the meal. Bangkok - Abu Dhabi. Check in was lightning fast, and the ground staff at check in and at the gate were lovely, smiling, cracking jokes and being efficient and the same time. Boarding was on time, very orderly via boarding groups, and done via jet bridge. The plane was a Boeing 777-300 again, and the onboard experience mirrored the one on the previous flight - a lot of drinks, friendly, smiling and polished crew, delicious meals, adequate seating, great IFE. Abu Dhabi - Moscow. This flight was on an older Airbus 320, with sluggish IFE system, but it still was perfectly ok. What was not ok, however, was the fact that armrests on this airplane didn't go fully up - only like 45 degrees. Due to the armrest situation I struggled to get comfortable and lie down. Cabin crew were amazingly friendly, polite and eager to assist for a flight that departed at 3am. The flight was quiet and uneventful. Overall, Etihad exceeded my expectations, and I will gladly fly them again!"

She even went out of her way and roughly “knocked” the toilet door at me and asked me to “hurry up, please” because an old lady was waiting her turn and was apparently in her way. Etihad needs to get crash courses from ANA, Japan Airlines or Qatar Airways on how to treat passengers. Also, who serves spicy chickpeas and lentils on a 14 hour flight!"

Airlines did not contact the phone numbers associated with the booking to let them know of the situation.

I was looking forward to my first experience with Etihad. I checked the check in time and was second in the queue. Checking in did not start until 30mins after the advertised time as the staff that were there, were engaged in admin, putting on roles of paper and checking the computers. When I went forward the printer did not work, the representative had problems with the computer and after a further half hour I asked to be referred to either another agent or a supervisor. She came along and said to her colleague and what’s the matter now, I think this was not the first time a problem like this had occurred. The whole episode did not give me confidence that my luggage would reach its final destination. No security questions were asked or covered which was perhaps the most serious omission. When I did get onto the aircraft it was delayed a further hour which would mean I would miss my connecting flight. No explanation or apology was given or any arrangements for connecting flight. No organisation is perfect and things do go wrong with the best of carriers, but they are remembered for what they do to put things right and this did not happen before, during or after the flight to date. This is submitted as a constructive review in the hope that training can be given within customer service to both meet and exceed customers expectations."

All apologies but didn’t make up for the fact that the service as abysmal. They took my name, tel number and email address and said they would be in touch, they got in touch and the reply was “sorry we’ll try to do better next time”. They have cut it to the bone.

Entertainment system is good otherwise, but this crazy policy compared with competitors who leave it on while on the ground is bizarre. As others have said they have recently introduced charges for seat reservations which have been applied irrespective of when the booking was made - if it's free on booking, it should be remain free! And the policy for exit rows is ludicrous - something like £140 per seat per segment, so as most people connect through AUH that would be £560 each for a return trip!!

Etihad have recently cancelled the ability to book / change Economy Class seats free of charge before the flight. What is worse is that when you try to book a seat using their useless ""Guest"" program it simply loads a splash screen saying ""unable to manage booking"" so you are left wondering if there is a glitch with your ticket. My ticket was issued early July and I changed the seat on my outward leg no issue. Turns out that this new policy was introduced from July 10 so because my return leg is late August I have to pay to change my seat. That seems doubly unfair as the ticket was purchased with the understanding that seat changes were a free option. To rub even more salt in to the wound apparently you can check in 48 hours before online but you can only choose a seat for free 24 hours before. So you are left with a Mexican stand-off between checking in and being auto allocated a seat or checking in ""late"" after selecting a free seat from a depleted choice! Cynical or what? And it gets worse. Both in my ""Guest"" account and using their web site I can't even access to pay for a seat choice! I fly Etihad on business monthly and this horrible, cynical, unfair policy is a deal-breaker for me. +1 lost customer Etihad!"

There was a severe crisis with floods hitting Kerala and the Kochi International airport being shut down. There was a long layover at Abu Dhabi airport as flights were being rescheduled to accommodate for cancelled flights. The staff were considerate enough to reschedule the tickets and provide the preferred airport considering my parents age. The service at the airport hotel where they were placed during the layover was exceptional.

Etihad needs to get a grip and not totally rip off their passengers. I wished to change just 1 leg of our 4 leg ticket to have a stay over in Abu Dhabi. I checked the current rate for the new date and it was practically identical to what we had paid. The current business return for the journey - all 4 legs - today is €2,250. Etihad wants the absurd sum of €2,300 to change just the 1 leg by 2 days .- remember, for which I had already paid.  A mere single simple change of 1 leg fby 2 days so we could stay 2 nights on Abu Dhabi for which we had already paid. Quite disgraceful. Getting onto their basic and clearly understaffed agents is a waste of time. I was left for 22 minutes before the agent cut me off. Today it was 18 minutes before I got any answers. What on earth do these agents to for the 6 minutes she went away for, after 12 minutes already, just to check the next day flight? A 5-star airline? Perhaps when they started but not anymore. Etihad is at best a 3-star airline. By the way, on the flight, they ran out of all our choices for dinner so we did not eat.Good planning Etihad. Well done. My headphones did not work. "

H Torken",,19th August 2018,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Pune to Dusseldorf via Abu Dhabi,October 2017,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,1,no,2,"  Pune to Dusseldorf via Abu Dhabi. Etihad shares incorrect pickup numbers (Rail&Fly) and lets the customer sit at the additional cost. In October 2017 my wife and I flew with Etihad from TXL via AMS and AUH to PNQ. Originally the flight was to go directly from TXL via AUH to PNQ. However, there was a rebooking due to the Air Berlin bankruptcy, so that our flight went longer than planned. Even worse was the rebooking of the return flight, which did not go to Berlin as planned but to Düsseldorf from where we were to continue with the DB. For this we were given pick-up numbers, with which one would receive the train tickets directly at the automat. The outbound flight went as planned. On our return flight we arrived in DUS with a slight delay and hurried to the station. At the Automat it turned out, however, that the pick-up numbers were wrong. A DB employee checked on the computer and confirmed that there were no orders for the numbers provided. Since we had already reserved seats for the train, we decided to buy train tickets at our own expense to finally get home after the long flight. The train tickets were accordingly expensive (205 Euro for two persons) Only a few days later I contacted Etihad. Some e-mails and phone calls followed, until I was told to fill out a form with the bank details for reimbursement and the train tickets should be enclosed. I sent the documents by registered letter to Etihad in Berlin. Of course this was accepted (registered mail). However, there was never a reaction. Since I didn't buy my tickets directly from Etihad but from Flighttix.com, which I contacted first and which told me I had to contact Etihad because Etihad gave me the wrong pickup numbers, I contacted Flighttix.com again in April 2018. The contact persons were very friendly and promised me to clarify the matter with Etihad. E-mail correspondence followed between Flighttix, Etihad and myself, after which Etihad finally requested my bank details again for reimbursement. After I transmitted it, I thought it was finally done and I could sleep peacefully again. Unfortunately, there was never any refund. With my inquiries to Flighttix I got several times feedback that they will inquire with Etihad. My direct requests to the employee of Etihad (Commercial Planning Agent), with whom the correspondence took place, all went to nothing. E-mails were never answered and on the phone came only the automatic announcement that the contact person was currently not available. It's really sad how Etihad has behaved here. You are prepared to accept a much longer flight, even if you changed your reservation to a train journey, and in the end you would be left with additional costs and would be ignored by the airline after investing so much time and effort in clarifying the facts. The flight itself was fine. However, I will avoid Etihad in the future. My hope of receiving reimbursement and an apology after almost a year is fading."

Very disappointed, ground staff totally unorganized, there was no specific check in counter for each destination, we reached 3 hours before and were standing in line but the others who came late of different flights were been called forward when we asked the reason they said their flight is before us so that we have to call them first even when they came late. Due to which after 2:30 hour standing in line when we reach on check in counter they said flight is over booked and we have to re book it again. Then we again went to another counter for re-booking the ticket, the guy on rebooking counter was so slow took 1 hour to book 3 tickets and was not even bothered about the line. When we at last reach on the rebooking counter they gave us a flight of 10pm which were reaching New Delhi at 3:30 AM. Since our flight was canceled we we’re eligible for 200$ discount on nxt flight, lunch&dinner voucher and stay in hotel until we get our next flight as per etihad policy, person on rebooking counter gave us 200$ voucher only and when I asked, is there anything else we should get? he clearly said no. Then we went to his supervisor to complain about this, he send us again to him for other things - he gave us breakfast vouncher which was of no use and when i asked 3rd time he only gave me lunch and dinner voucher but still no hotel stay.

At Lahore airport check in, I was only provided boarding passes from Lahore to Abu Dhabi and was advised that I would get the boarding passes for Washington in Abu Dhabi. When we arrived at Abu Dhabi, it turned out that next flight was overbooked and there were no seats. I was advised that all the flights to Washington were overbooked for next few days. The only option they gave me was to fly to Brussels the next day and then from there to Washington. We had no choice. It was very hard with the child traveling with me. Our travel duration suddenly went from 21 hours to 40 hours and we finally got to our destination a full day later. It was bad that they overbooked the flight but to make matters worse they failed to disclose it at the Lahore airport. If I was given a choice there, I would have opted not to board the first flight and gone over the alternatives with them there. I had the option of going home if things did not work out. But they never gave me that option and conned me in to boarding that first flight. They made our travel horrible and made us suffer. There were lines of people on transit desk arguing with them about the same issue. Is that how they would treat their own families. This was one of the worst air travel experience we had. Never Etihad. You lost at least our family."

After reading multiple mixed reviews, I thought I’d give Etihad the benefit of the doubt. I booked my ticket with them and paid a lot of money. I must say that I have been let down. I have been fortunate to fly many airlines and Etihad has been the least helpful to date. On my leg from Abu Dhabi to JFK, I was put in a seat that that had no cabin space above me for my hand luggage. As a result the air hostesses took my hang luggage and places it (split up) in various cabins down my aisle. When it came to disembarking at JFK, I forgot one of these items as they weren’t all in one spot. After realising that I forgot my item two hours later, I quickly returned to arrivals to try and find someone who could help me retrieve it - assuming etihad would have an office, station or even just a lost and found. I could not find a single Etihad representative and was told by many airport staff that they wouldn’t be around for quite some time. I had to catch my next connection thereafter. Following online instructions, I phoned the New York Etihad number. I phoned multiple times and had no answer. I’ve left messages. I’ve had no response. I emailed Etihad but the response here was that I should phone the New York etihad number. I’ve even phoned baggage services at JFK who have told me to contact Etihad. I am out of options despite the great efforts. I understand it’s my fault to have left an item onboard, however, one would think that they would help solve this issue and that a “competitive” airline like Etihad would assist in trying to return personal belongings to their owners. I have read reviews that other airlines certainly have. I’m really upset to have lost my belonging but even more upset to know that it is sitting with Etihad who do not care at all about their customers. Utterly disappointed and something like this will definitely deter me from using Etihad again."

I don’t expect any response from Etihad because they acted within their rules but it is important that people understand how these rules affect their Platinum members. I was recently traveling business class from Abu Dhabi with my wife for our 20th wedding anniversary. I also paid for my daughter, son in law and my two grandchildren to travel with us for a family holiday to celebrate. As Platinum members (through all our business travel) my wife and I are entitled to bring a guest each into the First Class Lounge. My youngest grandchild was able to enter for free. However the Etihad staff insisted on charging me 100 USD to admit my 7 year old grandson to the Lounge. I refused to pay such an extortionate amount for a 7 year old and we had to leave. My poor grandson then got incredibly upset as he felt he had let us all down. He was inconsolable. Nice work Etihad, because whilst your staff will not know my grandchild is autistic, their actions have consequences. Still at least you enforced your rules. Even better, didn’t get the 100 USD and as a bonus upset 2 loyal Platinum members on their 20th wedding anniversary whose loyalty to this airline with rapidly declining service standards is now severely strained. Can’t argue with that policy can you! Now where did I put Emirates phone number."

Paul O'Connor",A380,10th August 2018,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Dublin via Abu Dhabi,August 2018,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  Etihad Seat Allocation Policy is a major drawback. Seats can only be reserved by paying additional fees. At over $40 per sector (for non premium seats) this adds about 15% to the cost of the flight. Travel agent told me seat allocation is free at check-in. Online check-in opens 48 hours before, but again you can only select seats by paying, you only get free seat allocation if you checking within 24 hours of your flight. This is the only airline I have flown (apart from outright budget airlines) that have this policy. Be careful in comparing based on ticket price alone. Haven't even travelled yet and I have an unpleasant experience."

Sadly disappointing and a very underwhelming business class experience with Etihad. I remember the days when Etihad was at the top of its game. This is no longer the case. The aircraft interiors are ageing and they are no longer able to compete with the likes of Qatar or Emirates. I flew from Melbourne to Dublin via Abu Dhabi. The aircraft was old and dated. Seats much smaller than their competitors. Food was average - wine selection average. Their IFE system woefully average with only a handful of new releases available. Bathrooms are much smaller than their competitors. No pyjamas offered. The lounge experience in Abu Dhabi was average. Overcrowded and people lining up to use the one available shower. Our flight to Dublin was below average. The business class seats were much smaller than on our long haul flight from Melbourne. Staff were pleasant. I asked for an amenities kit only to be told Etihad no longer provided them on short flights - ask most people and I think they’d agree, 7 and a half hours isn’t really a ‘short flight’. Etihad now strikes me as a ‘budget’ carrier. Gone are the days of it providing a luxurious business class experience."

Tried the onboard WiFi but really it’s very slow & eats up your allotment very quickly so be warned if you decide to give it a go..it’s a bit of a con to get extra money from your pocket.

Thanks to the worst possible timing for a baggage delay, I have had to sink my savings to get backup, subpar clothes for what was otherwise a perfectly planned wedding! This is not the first time I've heard of Etihad's baggage handling issues, and I regret not listening closer to friends' advice. To add salt to injury, stewardesses on the flight were rude, one of which said during meal service, ""we only have the vegetarian pasta option, is that okay?"", with her hand already half outstretched with the tray close to my table. She could have some common courtesy and ask for my preference first! I have had better and more courteous service on Easyjet and Ryanair. Unfortunately I have a return flight leg from Kuala Lumpur back to London and I am nervous thinking about what problems are going to surface on that leg of the journey. If I could afford it, I would rather purchase another airline's tickets and take a longer transit than fly this airline again."

C Daile",,2nd August 2018,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Dublin to Brisbane via Abu Dhabi,September 2017,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  
I logged online to upgrade 3 of our 10 travelers to extra leg room seats. My parents and my partner and infant. When one of the seats was not assigned, even though I had paid for it, I called the help centre to find out why. When I spoke to the agent he told me I had not selected extra leg room seats, rather standard seats. These travelers already had standard seats allocated beside the rest of my family, before I went online to upgrade, so I ultimately chose seats away from the rest of our family for nothing, because I thought they were extra leg room seats. When I asked could I still get the extra leg room and pay the difference they advised me I will have to pay full price, the money I already paid 321 odd euro will be lost in the process. I am shocked and feel like I have been robbed. An honest mistake, which they found out about with 10 minutes of my doing So, meant nothing to them. Also, the seat I assigned for my partner and my child in the same transaction did not get allocated but I got charged for it. So they are also in the wrong. I am just been fobbed off every agent I speak to. Policy policy policy is all I am hearing. They do not seem to take general misunderstandings into account. There should at least be some sort of grace where time is concerned. They were aware I had made the error within 15 minutes. Why is there no proper customer service within this company. Nobody cares that I am in more debt with nothing now to show for it. My parents will have to suffer on their first ever flight, 24 hours long, with no space. This airline has absolutely no consideration for their customers if this is how they treat us when a mistake is made. They keep saying it was my mistake but they never allocated a seat for my partner so they too made a mistake, where is their liability? I am in dismay by the lack of understanding in a genuine case. I already had seats before I went online. Surely they could see this was an honest error made. We paid over 10,000 for our group trip, now an added 321 for nothing. Worse seats than what I had initially."

H Anderson",,26th July 2018,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Abu Dhabi to Bangkok,July 2018,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,,1,no,2," Abu Dhabi to Bangkok. This is a general review, I use Etihad quite often because it operates from my home city and the airmiles accrued through my credit card give me Gold Class membership which allows Business Class service prior to boarding the flight. About 8-10 years ago Etihad was my favourite airline edging out Emirates, Singapore and Qatar. It has steadily deteriorated since that point and for the last few years has felt like a budget airline. It feels like everything is run for the benefit of the airline and the customer is just a cash cow. It is the only airline I now that regularly boards the passengers one hour and 15 minutes before scheduled departure and is almost always late to depart. My last few flights menat that we were boarded almost two hours before take off and that makes a long haul flight that much more uncomfortable. During the two hour wait there are no refreshments and no entertainment. Two bum numbing hours without even a view out of the window as distraction. The refreshements seem to be fewer and further between, even the in seat call button frequently fails to get a response. During my last flight, the meal options were beef, chicken or vegetarian when I asked what the dishes were I was told again 'beef or chicken' I eventually established it was beef and rice or chicken and rice (I didn't ask about the vegetarian option). Airline food is universally mocked for being generally unpalatable but I remember that several years ago Etihad in-flight food as being something that I actually looked forward to. The food on my last flight (Bangkok - Abu Dhabi) was amongst the very worst I have ever had and I left all but small sample bites from the dishes. I also noticed on my last trip that Etihad are now offering an option to buy extra food items. A five star premium airline that sells snacks!! I'm sure that the decline in quality of the food and the introduction of paid for snacks is no coincidence. The entertainment system is still very good but it is switched off unceremoniously about 30 minutes before landing. Some airlines have the entertainment available from the moment you sit down until the time to leave and when I enquired why this isnt possible with Etihad I was told it was for safety reasons. Maybe Etihad have different safety regulations to other Middle East carriers but I suspect that it is so they can collect in the headsets early - which summarises the apparent Etihad policy of prioritising airline convenience over customer comfort. At every stage it seems that costs have been cut and cut and cut and has turned what once was a premium airline which was a pleasure to fly with, into a hollowed out shell with stressed staff, disgusting food, poor service, scant regard for customer comfort and an unwavering eye on the bottom line. In short a budget airline in all but name and price. Think twice before using this airline."

This service wasn't available on my flight and only found out on the day I flew out. The planes were both very uncomfortable, and no comfort kit or baby toys were offered (as Emirates and Qatar  do). Although I requested baby food, nothing was provided. During the flight no one of the staff came and asked if I, a mum traveling solo with a young child, needed help. (Last year Qatar flight attendants came several times making sure all was good and gave me baby food, toys and a pouch with baby lotions and nappies). The food for adults was barely edible and there was no meal choice. I think Etihad has to be considered a low cost airline not a 5-star and should definitely cost less, much less as it is so bad. Not worth the money! It cost more than Emirates and Qatar but it's worth zero compared to them. I will never choose Etihad again or recommend it."

C Leventis",Boeing 787 /A330,12th July 2018,Family Leisure,Business Class,Singapore to Athens via Abu Dhabi,June 2018,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1,no,1,"  Singapore to Athens via Abu Dhabi. The quality of this airline leaves a lot to be desired. Customer service is virtually non-existent. Even as a Gold member flying Business Class who had spent $25,000 on seats, I was treated by Etihad staff, with utter contempt and disdain. I flew with 6 family members, 2 of whom were infants. We spent more than $25,000 and 400,000 miles on our seats We were all in Business Class. I have been a gold member of the Etihad Guest rewards programme for 3 years. Despite repeated calls to the customer service line before we boarded, they did not manage to sit us together. Furthermore, the cabin crew did not help us to sit near each other, refusing to ask other passengers to move, even though those passengers were flying alone. The plane on the Singapore to Abu Dhabi leg has been replaced. Rather than the B787 which Etihad is quick to pretend flies on this route, it has been replaced by the aged A330, in which the business class offering is old and outdated. The plane is loud and most of all, extremely hot. When I complained about the offering, I was told that ""Etihad has the right to choose which planes it flies on its routes"". That is of course fine, but when you go to book the ticket online, the website clearly states you are paying for a seat on the Boeing 787. The bassinet seat I was offered for my daughter was above my head. She was able to wriggle out of it, and nearly fell out.  The customer services complaints officer has totally ignored my complaints and instead has either insinuated it is my fault or has said that I should have complained on the flight to the crew."

I decided to go with them because they were cheaper. After my first flight with them, I should've paid more for world class service from Emirates or Qatar. The staff at the check in were unfriendly, the seat recline broke which forced me to push my seat with my back the whole 12 hour flight. This gave me back pain days after. I couldn't find a flight attendant to notify about the seat. Its not just their staff that arent attentive, its their whole policy towards their less opulent customers. It is really difficult to get in contact with their customer service. To ""compensate customers"" for a bad flight they give something called travel credits which are worthless to you unless you want to buy another flight or buy overpriced seat selections. I do not recommend flying with them until they see the importance of all their customers and improve their product and policy."

E Lambton",,10th July 2018,Business,Business Class,Paris to Sydney via Abu Dhabi,July 2018,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1,no,3,"  Paris to Sydney via Abu Dhabi. Such a Disappointment. I have flown Etihad business in the past and what a fall from grace. As a frequent flyer who flies internationally at least 6 times a year and often in business, flying with Etihad is mediocre at best. 4 years ago it was fantastic and couldn't be faulted but now it is very average and nothing special. I travelled on points this time. The points for this Etihad flight are 30 - 60K more than their competitors which is a lot for their entry level business class points tickets. The crew on the CGD to ABU were average and did nothing to make you feel special. The plane was older and nothing special. The food was seriously no better than economy and in fact I have had better food in economy on other airlines in the past. The main meal I had I couldn't eat due to the meat being so full of gristle. There was so little food as well. On the flight from ABU to Sydney I asked what time breakfast was so I could set an alarm to wake up. I was told that Etihad no longer serve breakfast. The reason, 'people are on different time zones'. I said to the hostess that this is ridiculous and it was nothing but cost cutting. I also asked has management changed because something is clearly happening with this airline. I was told it is under new management and the staff are bearing the brunt of disgruntled customers. Maybe this explains why you don't see them much anymore. I must say the hostess I spoke with was really trying and stated I could I lodge a formal complaint with her. I felt that this would possibly be more effective and seeing by the amount of complaints on this site, maybe I was wrong. With regard to breakfast, you can order from the all day menu which includes pastries (2 small), cereal, egg white omelette, noodles or a steak sandwich. You cannot get a real egg omelette and breakfast is lack lustre. The main meal (beef) was so bad again it couldn't be eaten. It was as tough as a brick. I was informed this is because everything is reheated. Food is very poor. Apart from the food, the staff are not often seen like in the past. A few years ago, travelling Etihad business was a treat. Staff were attentitive & polite, food was wonderful and business was worth the money and/or points. Now it's get on, get off. Having flown Premium with another airline late last year, I can honestly state that their Premium was far more superior than Etihad's business class. C"

W Edmonds",A330 / A380,8th July 2018,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Edinburgh to Sydney via Abu Dhabi,June 2018,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,,3,no,5," Etihad is the epitome of 'okay'. The first leg of our flight was on a tired looking A330, the cabin of which was looking decidedly dated and the IFE hardware not particularly responsive. The flight attendants were not overly friendly or helpful which was fine but they did not give the impression of working for a premium, full-service airline and I've probably had friendlier crews on easyJet flights. The best that can be said for the meal on this flight was once again, okay, nothing to complain about but nothing exciting either. Although, the use of steel cutlery is nice to see. The primary benefit of transferring at Abu Dhabi is its small size meaning that its relatively easy to get from one gate to another for connections but it was also easy to tell how cramped and crowded it would be to spend more than an hour here for a stopover as the airport certainly needs to expand to meet demand. AUH's most interesting feature is its security policy whereby hand luggage is scanned and passengers made to go through metal detectors which every, single, person seemed to be setting off, including myself, despite having nothing on me and not having had any issues at EDI. This then means being patted down in a small curtained area with an unfriendly and unspeaking member of security staff. Not only this, but once passengers arrive at their gate everyone on our outbound flight (though only certain people on our return, we were waved through without searching strangely) was having their carry-on hand searched which seemed slightly excessive giving all the security measures passengers have already been through up to that point. The next leg of the trip was on a relatively new A380 which had a modern cabin and great IFE system despite the seats being uncomfortable this felt like a much better flight. The crew were marginally more friendly than the EDI-AUH leg but still did not go out of their way to be courteous or helpful for passengers. The most disappointing thing on this flight was the food, not its quality but lack of quantity. There are no menus in economy which is fine but would have been a nice touch. We were served a dinner after takeoff of which there were only two options left so I chose the pasta which was delicious and came with a salad, roll and small pudding. But during this 13 hour flight we were only given one more 'snack' of popcorn and then a breakfast of cinnamon roll and custard before landing in Sydney, at half past five in the evening. This was not enough food for the length of flight. Our return flights were of similar quality the only issue being the check-in staff at Sydney Kingsford Smith airport. Passengers were queuing for check in as it was shown as being open for this flight on the overhead monitors however, the ground staff were all standing behind one desk chatting, laughing, hugging each other and not one desk was open yet. After standing for half an hour and a now huge queue having developed with several people going over to ask what was going on check-in finally opened. Once we eventually got to the bag-drop counter we were greeted by an unfriendly man who answered my request to print off our boarding passes with 'obviously'. Not a good impression. Overall the experience of flying with Etihad was just fine, nothing more or less but I would definitely try another carrier for a long-haul flight before ever choosing them again as even though they were the cheapest option it certainly shows."

Really disappointed with the customer service I have received today with Etihad as I have been refused lounge access as a silver member. It clearly states on the website ""As an Etihad Guest Silver member, you also get lounge access, priority check in, 25% extra Tier Bonus Miles and so much more."" Apparently this is only in Abu Dhabi so I asked if they would make an exception today as this clearly needs rectifying on the website but was still refused. I will now return to Emirates as their customer service far outweighs that of Etihad. I'm still shocked that they wouldn't let me in as a goodwill gesture and to keep me as a loyal customer in future."

My friend told her get the extension and let him sit on my lap but she never agreed and forcefully held the baby and strapped the belt very tightly around him and he started crying loudly because of pain but she said let him cry but he will sit like that only.

The aircraft in the DMM-AUH sector was an old 320. A small snack was offered on that short flight and the IFE was unresponsive which annoyed me. We landed AUH on time but the connections in AUH is horrible. Very long queue for security check and I hated this terminal. The flight to BLR was delayed by 2 hrs because the aircraft arrived late. The boarding was extremely chaotic and there was no AC in the boarding area inspire of 46 C heat along with humidity later in the day. The aircraft was a newer A321 with good touchscreens but the selection of movies is not great The cabin service was good and food was excellent along with drinks offered. The downside was that one lavatory wasn't working which led to queue across the aisle .We landed 2 hrs later than our scheduled landing time .The cabin crew were really good.

Yvette Watt",,5th July 2018,Business,Economy Class,Melbourne to Frankfurt via Abu Dhabi,June 2018,3.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,,3,no,3,"  Well, I have to say my recent flight from Melbourne to Frankfurt with Etihad was without a doubt the worst travel experience I have had, and I travel quite a lot. Not only did they not supply my requested vegan meals on either connection, on the second leg one of the cabin crew spilled very hot coffee on me. Of course accidents can happen but despite letting them know my arm was actually burnt and I needed something for it I had to ask 3 times and wait over 20 minutes before I was brought a poultice. The flowing days my arm was red and a small section blistered. Not supplying requested vegan meals appears to be pretty standard as exactly the same thing happened on the same route almost exactly a year ago, and my colleague who flew the same route in reverse also did not have his vegan meals supplied in March of this year. A complaint to the customer service team was met with a pathetic response - 3000 air miles as compensation. But my flights were booked with Virgin Australia where my air miles are based, and they were not transferable to this program. And what kind of totally inadequate compensation is 3000 air miles to me anyway? As a Gold Velocity member I expect better of both Virgin (whose response was also inadequate) and Etihad. I will never fly Etihad again, and this will have a flow on effect to Virgin as I shift my alliance to QANTAS and affiliated airlines."

They lost my luggage, expected me to run across different gates in 20 minutes for a connecting flight which I missed and gave all the other passengers with me who missed the connecting flight smack. In fact, we had to fight to get them to put us up in a hotel and get us on the next flight. It took 3 hours to sort out everything. For me, they are the worst airline. This time I had to fly them for work - I had no say in the process and had to go with it. Wear and tear on the plane was obvious, food was mediocre and you could tell they had some cost cuts based on the amount of food that was served and the lack of menus. Flight attendants were OK, not the same quality you would get from Emirates/KLM/Singapore Airlines. I wouldn’t fly Etihad unless you really didn’t have a choice. "

Outside of the ground services being helpful at Heathrow on our trip from Heathrow to Bangalore, most things were objectively downhill. Seats in economy class are quite uncomfortable. The recliner in the seat did not work at all and the only option provided to us was to switch to an empty seat, if available. There was no vegetarian meal option, despite the fact that our fares included a meal option. The staff were discourteous and made no attempt to procure the same for multiple passengers who demanded it, and merely dismissed the requests stating that only chicken/lamp was available.  The food was extremely poor, and the vegetarian pasta which was ultimately given after protests was of very poor quality. I would not recommend ordering it, if given a choice. The staff onboard were not polite and were often dismissive. The entertainment onboard was very good and the headphones, screens etc. worked perfectly. Overall, I would not recommend flying this airline. It is neither the cheaper nor the more comfortable option."

So they go around and say ""Chicken or lamb"" up to you to work out what it is served with. No cheese, no bread roll. This is cost cutting taken to the extreme. You will also not see any wines or spirit on the trolley, by hiding it they certainly hope to reduce cost.

I am very unhappy with the airline website and their chaotic seating selection and bidding system for upgrades. I am an older flier and the seat comfort and accessibility is very important to me, but you are unable to book seats until 48 hours before take off, which I think is unacceptable. In addition to this you can bid for upgrades or neighbour free seats. We did this and were offered neighbour free seats on the Abu Dhabi to London leg of the flight, which were subsequently withdrawn. In the meantime we had paid for extra leg room seats and charged for these. On check in we did not have the extra leg room seats, and had been allocated individual seats in different sections of the cabin. The ground crew person at check in could not change this, so we were told to go to the transfer desk in Abu Dhabi where we were given the neighbour free seats we had asked for. It has since taken me 2 months to get a refund of the first seats. In general the seats were very cramped and uncomfortable, and on the first section of our journey we had no option but to sit in an ordinary seat. We are also vegetarian and I ordered an Asian vegetarian meal which is normally acceptable on most flights, however it was very poor. My husband found his lactose-ovo meal disgusting, and could not eat it. Abu Dhabi airport is also awful. It is cramped and scruffy with hardly any comfortable seating, and extortionately expensive food. I will never fly with Etihad again."

I ended up with back pain and at the end the weight ended up in the plane, only on my back! I don't see what's the point beside having unhappy customers (even premium ones). Etihad is on self-destruct mode after they posted massive losses and what's worse is that it was not due to operational costs but rather poor investment decisions that are being taken on their customers."

One of the worst airline I've ever been on. Very bad food and the plane is out of date. The in flight entertainment was terrible, both the screen (very pixelated and small), the headphone (fuzzy noise) and the content itself. We have to wait about 20mins after the flight took off to be able to use it and they disabled it 30mins before landing.  I thought I was just unlucky and after my transit, in Abu Dhabi we'll get onto a better plane; wrong, I didn't think this was possible but the plane we changed into was even worse. When we landed in Abu Dhabi we have to wait around 15mins for a bus to take us to the terminal. The airport was also not anything like other Middle Eastern airports like I've been to, it was dull, old and small. The food and service were horrible. "

They don't even have lotions in their rest room or provide a mini kit for long haul flights and encourage passengers to purchase instead. They did not have enough vegetarian selection and they had provided extra bread as a compensation on a 14 hr flight. Do not have snacks, again they have a selection of snacks for purchase. It was very weird to me as the other airlines I had travelled to NY before had been very different and much much better compared to Etihad."

I have been using Etihad for the last 7 years, initially we were happy with the service. Later on we joined Etihad guest programm, as 4 of us from our family traveling often , and that helps to earn miles. In the past we often didn't get credits for our flight, so we tried to do retroclaim by ourselves but sometimes it didn't work when we upgraded from the economy into business class. We would write to retroclaim centre and that would help, but sometimes even that wouldn't help and we had to ring, but eventually the problem would be sorted out. The last flight of my wife hasn't been credited for a long time but now we need these miles soon in order for us to book the next flight. Despite writing to retroclaim and ringing Etihad which has got the call centre in Belgrade, nothing helped. In the last 7 weeks I rang the Etihad call centre in Belgrade four times and was disappointed how they handled my concern. When I rang for the third time I explained tat I needed these miles in a 10 days time in order to book the next flight. I expected help as I earned the gold Etihad guest card after all these years. The operator  promised to me that she would personally take care of the situation and in 10 days she would update me with the progress by phone call. After 10 days nothing was done so I decided to ring. After waiting for about two and half hours and no one ringing me I rang back and this time spoke to a very rude person who kept interrupting me and basically told me to just wait as they can't help. I am thinking of flying with Qatar from now on as I heard they are excellent. "

Everything is by the book with this airline, won't accommodate any flexibility or minor requests. Simple request to have the new baggage policy apply for my trip (1x23kg vs 30kg total) and or options for bringing a second bag. No avail, only option was to pay for a second bag at a ridiculous rate or $900+AUD, even your call centre staff were appalled. I simply wanted to travel with 2 bags to ease the load, but no, you can't even accommodate that. Why is this flexibility important? If something goes wrong, I want an airline that can understand an issue from a human's perspective and not simply throw policy, terms and conditions."

Lady at luggage drop first discussed whatever it was for 10 minutes with another passenger, then let a couple unpack and repack their suitcases instead of sending them away to do that elsewhere. Luggage drop is luggage drop, please! My aisle seat that I had chosen during online checking was changed to a window seat. When asked why, no proper answer was given except that the plane was full, the plane is no more or less full whether my seat is changed or not, so this could obviously not be the reason and my aisle seat hat been free when i had checked in. Obviously, they gave it to somebody else who had checked in later than me. After boarding, cabin crew tried for a full half hour to find an aisle seat for a drunk passenger because he said he might need to go to the toilet quickly. I see, drunk hooligans get their wishes filled, on the expenses of other passengers! Then the crew ordered five (!) different people to take the seat beside me, only to make them change again to yet another seat and another seat. What good is online check in if you the crew changes the seats whenever and for whatever reason they please? If a family with 7 people is too stupid to check in online in due time, then let them sit in separate rows and distant seats and don‘t make it the problem of other passengers. Next, the crew chatted again and again with a mother with two young kids instead of serving my and other passenger‘s food. All in all, flight was heavily overbooked, check in and boarding complete chaos, and the crew openly and heavily preferred some passengers over others. I will avoid Etihad in the future whenever possible!"

Very disappointing that Etihad have twice substituted an A380 with a Boeing 777 on a 13+ hour flight from Abu Dhabi to Sydney. The Boeing is older, noisier with far less space than the Airbus. Etihad heavily promote the A380 on all their media platforms. I have paid on average about £3,500 each trip with my decision based equally on the aircraft as well as the airline. What is most disappointing is the lack of engagement from Etihad when I have complained. It appears the concept of customer service is quite an alien one. Oddly on both occasions when Etihad have used 777s instead of the promoted A380s, citing “technical issues”, the. A380 appears to be far from full as a 777 could not accommodate all passengers. Will think hard before booking with Etihad again."

I booked my tickets over the phone with a call centre and the experience was excellent. I was assured as a Velocity Gold Member I would have lounge access in Abu Dhabi both ways, in Sydney and in Rome. I was told only that my changed booking from Bangkok to Danang would not be with Etihad but with Bangkok Airways. I gave the call centre staff member all 3 Velocity membership numbers as we are a family pooler. They were recorded duly. So, all good. I then also, as a precaution, emailed Velocity and Etihad again to confirm lounge access and received a response from both airways advising of lounge access details. Everything was great at Sydney except I was told they could not print off my boarding pass for Abu Dhabi to Rome as there was a problem with their software. Never mind, these things happen. We experienced the lounge in Sydney and it was, it has to be said, pretty solid. Food and drink were on the mark, and service was good.  On arrival in Abu Dhabi, however, things started to unravel. We were shuffled to 3 different places before I was able to be issued my boarding pass. Then off we went to the lounge. On arrival at Al Rheim lounge we were advised we could not access as our forward journey to Rome was operated by Alitalia. Despite the emails I had from both airlines, no go, as it was a codeshare flight. I was advised to write a complaint to Etihad once we were back. So, we wiped our losses and paid for another lounge. On the way back, no lounge in Rome, but we were allowed access to the Al Rheim lounge in Abu Dhabi. However, when we arrived back, things grew worse. I lodged a complaint with the details and evidence. Then we waited for our points and waited. And waited some more. Finally we lodged a request with Velocity and waited the 2 months. We then contacted Velocity again and they said they would need to escalate the issue with Etihad. We were also told by the attendant at Velocity Gold member inquiries that Etihad were ""known"" for this type of behaviour and often allocated points and status credits incorrectly. It has been a lot of work to try and get this mess sorted out. Since January when we wrote a complaint to Etihad we haven't even had a response. It has to be said that for the 3 of us, it was our first and last experience with Etihad. What a disappointment."

On the flight however it was stated that it was not ordered and I must not have ordered in advance, I explained that I had ordered it several months in advance and confirmed but the impression they gave was that I was not telling the truth. The Senior on board provided me with some fruit and the salad from the meal but no real meal was able to be given. She was very apologetic and took note of it on the system so that on the return I would receive the meal. However on the return the same issue happened, the crew member was far less apologetic and insinuated that I had not booked it properly. I was given only an apple for the flight. I complained and Etihad stated it was a system error, just not sure how the error could have happened twice. Staff should be made aware that system errors happen and should not make assumptions that the issue is on the passengers side. Should possibly have more information of the ingredients (allergen list) in the meals provided so if the error happens you can see if any of the meals on board would be suitable."

We paid more for the flights with etihad over a lesser-known airline as we wanted to guarantee a seamless journey. Wrong. Firstly, we were sat separately on 3 out of 4 legs of the journey The online check in didn’t work, so we had no choice. 3 our of 4 of my seats did not recline, but the seats in front did. This meant that on each leg of the journey I was cramped up for several hours. I am fairly small, so I can only imagine how frustrating this would be for anyone of a larger stature. Next up, they overbooked the final leg of our flight by over 20+ people and point blank refused to let us on. They rerouted us resulting in a 12 hour wait in Abu Dhabi airport. No hotel. No apology. One extremely rude member of staff dealt with us who was nothing but arrogant about the whole situation. This delay has had major implications on us both financially (kennel for an extra day for 3 dogs and business implications) yet Etihad merely issued us a ‘meal voucher’ which afforded us a soft drink and pack of grapes. Utterly disgraceful. Also, do not be fooled by the ‘luxurious’ lure of this airline: the aircraft are old and uncomfortable. The screens are older than me and on each journey we heard at least 2-3 people near by whose screens didn’t work at all. No chance of changing seat in that case, they overbook each flight, remember!

I was very upset that to be seated separately so we tried to do the check in again so we can be seated together on our way back. I tried check in online and also tried to contact the customer services over phone but I couldn't do it, so we went to the airport very early and requested seats to be together and they passed the buck and requested to talk at the transit desk at Abu Dhabi Airport. The staff at the transit counter said the same thing that the flight is full and told me she would put a comment on system for the boarding staff and they may be able to offer seats together. At the boarding gate, staff mentioned that I will need to speak to the cabin crew. Cabin crew was very hesitant to speak to other passengers and finally I had to personally request passengers if they can swap seats so we can sit together. One of the passenger was so kind and he volunteered to change his aisle seat and took one of the other middle seats that was allocated to me. This is the worst airline I have travelled so far, although they had sufficient time to sort my request, they kept passing the buck and left me with passenger's mercy. The thought of what would have happened during an emergency situation if we were sitting separately still haunts me."

Typically, airline companies will ask for volunteers to take another flight. In this case I had no choice in the matter. Secondly, airline companies will usually re-book customers on comparable flights. In this case I was re-booked on a connecting flight even though my purchase was on a non-stop to Los Angeles with minimal compensation. When I emailed Etihad’s customer service, their response was that they would do nothing more than what they already had “in the event of denied boarding.” If Etihad feels that denying people who have purchased tickets is their right, I will no longer be flying with them."

I routinely fly business class and have flown business class on Etihad on many occasions but this flight from Melbourne to Abu Dhabi was the worst ever. Dreamliner does not accurately describe the aircraft and the cabin crew seemed less than enthused to be on board. The seat was extremely hard and very uncomfortable, although there are apparently features which should allow a passenger to change the softness/lumbar support etc they failed to make any difference. Previous flights on other aircraft have been better thanks to passengers having the ability to alter cushioning etc to suit. The ergonomics for using the seating area are not good. Tray table extends sideways from the console and cannot be moved back or forward, you have to move your seat to gain access to the table, touch screen tv or handset. Etihad has also downgraded the service, no decent amenity pack, no mattress, no pyjamas and food listed in the menu was not available even immediately after take off. The reduction in cabin noise was minimal in my opinion and the cabin was rather cold throughout the 14hour journey. Cabin crew did ask when I wanted to eat but ignored my request to wait for two plus hours and my meal was presented shortly after take off! I have indicated that I would recommend Etihad because of numerous previous journeys but although I have been happy with Etihad in the past I’m no longer convinced that the passenger continues to be considered as important and am not sure that Etihad will be my airline of choice in future."

Toilets and aircraft overall seemed grubby. There were no menus to check what was on offer and what was on offer inedible unless you were starving due to queuing for hours to check in (even after online check in).

Cost cutting evident, no amenity kits distributed with only basic eye-pad / ear plugs / flight socks available on request. Food and drink menu limited compared to what was available in the past - no offer of food on demand, the vegetarian fettuccine dry and tasteless. Staff attentive though not proactive with the distribution of water or other soft drinks during the flight. Entertained myself watching live English football and an early James Bond film. No free wifi. On time arrival on an air bridge at Abu Dhabi, which is exceptionally rare for Etihad.

G Mealen",A380,8th March 2018,Solo Leisure,First Class,Sydney to Munich via Abu Dhabi,January 2018,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,3,no,7,"  Sydney to Munich via Abu Dhabi. No chauffeur service except in Abu Dhabi or generally have first class facilities at many airports. The first class seating is  good although the narrow beds are desperately hard. Food has never been at the best standard despite great efforts by many of the crew. First class check-in at Sydney Airport was shared with economy passengers the reason given that there was only one first class passenger. In reality there were several upgrades. The lounge is shared with business class and is underwhelming. Service was poor. Upon requesting assistance to the aircraft I was advised as I was not a Residence passenger no assistance would be available. The person was close to being abusive. In flight crew were helpful and polite on both legs. At Munich Airport a car which had been ordered failed to turn up and a circus like series of telephone calls commenced. The airport bus proved more reliable. There are all the signs of serious cost cutting at this airline at every level and premium passengers are paying the price for seriously flawed management decisions made in the past. The ground staff at Munich have been wonderful, at least those working for the airline. There have been many forced redundancies and sadly some who have left were the competent and service oriented professionals at different locations. London staff are particularly unhelpful. The airline is clearly not interested in maintaining high level service. After perhaps fifty flights in the front section one has to wonder if it is worth the loyalty."

Etihad Airways delayed its flight from Perth to Abu Dhabi for 7 hours due to a technical issue with the plane and finally took us to Abu Dhabi via Colombo, where we stayed for another 1.5 hours. Upon reaching Abu Dhabi, I was given a hotel room for 12 hours for a layover of 17 and a half hours as I had missed my connecting flight and my new flight was arranged via Bahrain with a layover of another 7.5 hours and no arrangement for hotel or meal vouchers. My original flight was supposed to take 17 hours to the final destination and I got there in 41 hours. Most disorganised and unprofessional as far as customer experience goes. Will never fly with them again."

I am a gold member of Etihad Guest card, and Government Traveler. I flew with Etihad last month from florence to Abu Dhabi and I was flying Business Class. My first comment was on the food as the quality dropped big time. The second and main comment was regarding customer service and how Etihad Baggage claim center handled my claim of lost luggage. The luggage was missing with no tracing for 10 days, and I was trying to call claim center with no luck. I sent emails but the response was not up to the expectation. Finally, after 10 days I received a call from the driver who is delivering my bag with no previous communication and during my working hours. I was really disappointed from the way that Etihad Airways handled this case. I sent them an email last month and till now no one responded back to me nor call me to make sure that I received my bag or if anything is missing. I really hope that this review can reach Etihad so they can pay more attention to these details as they are my favourite airlines till this moment."

I was very disappointed, seat space seems smaller but my husband had no leg space. He's 6ft and so is used to be restricted but this seemed much less than Emirates or Singapore Airlines, I ordered a low lactose meal and was given vegetarian which was just cheesy vegetables. I explained that cheese is lactose and was told I should order the right meal. I told them I had but they had the wrong one, which they were very nice about but strange they didn't think of this before and instead assumed I made the mistake. I ended up getting a vegan meal which was fine. Also they ran out of diet coke at the first beverage service before they reached us. Not the end of the world but quite random seeing as we were 20mins into the flight and surely not a surprise that diet coke is quite popular? A sign of poor preparation. Flight from Abu Dhabi to Colombo seemed to be a very old aircraft but was fine. Entertainment options good but you cant start using it till after the flight has taken off. FYI all films are censored. Also you have to pay a lot extra for everything, extra leg room was £200 for one leg of the trip (4 legs in total- London to Abu Dhabi and Abu Dhabi to Colombo and return). It seems a bit of a budget pricing model. All round super average and not better than Emirates, Singapore Airlines, Qatar Airways or even BA (I know!). I probably wouldn't fly with them again."

Etihad was once perhaps the best airline in terms of service, value, food, in-flight services, and miles program. After years of loyal service with Etihad, I can honestly say they all of these once great features have become degraded to the point where I could rate many budget airlines better in every feature than that of Etihad. Only recently I had an issue whereby they increased the amount of guest miles required to make bookings to most destinations, and this happened to occur whilst I was making two online bookings, and happened a day earlier than it should have. After many back and forth emails and calls to Etihad, the outcome was that I was to blame, and that I made up the story to try and gain extra miles. They robbed me of 45000 hard earned miles and refuse to acknowledge any fault from their system or at the very least come up with a resolution or compromise. And I am apparently a loyal Gold customer and also a government employee, where we are given privilege treatment. I can only imagine how a ""regular"" customer would have been treated. This is only one of many issues I have faced as their services decline along with their money hungry cost cutting approach to virtually all aspects of their business. It is a real shame. Sadly they assume that customers do not see through their ways, but I can see from the ample bad reviews that customers are not at all happy with Etihad. Perhaps it is time they listened to their loyalty base. I for one will be choosing alternate airline wherever possible - there are many cheaper airlines which have better services now than Etihad."

The girl on registration desk saw with attention my documents about pregnancy and gave us seats no. 8. This line located in front on evacuation exit. It means the back doesn't turn down. We knew it just in plane, unfortunately. To be pregnant and seating during 4 hours in one pose impossible! Our return flight has a 18 hours transit on Abu Dhabi. We ask about opportunity to get free hotel. And answer was no.  Can we pay for the room? The answer was no. We will say no to Etihad next time, like they answered to us."

They moved her ticket to Emirates and My mum needs to change her return ticket and fly soon due to her mum being sick. I called them and they refused to change her ticket because it's been changed once. I kept explaining her ticket changed by force because Etihad forced her to change the airline only. Date of the flight was the same but they refused it again. Now my mum needs to buy a new ticket and lose $2000. Very irresponsible airline.

I needed to make sure that my partner could pick me up from my destination so i had to hang up and call again the following day. I had no choice but to pay for the change. I then proceeded to call the customer services again the following day and they said that the cost is now £357. It was explained that the £260 was a special price on the day. With no choice I had to proceed. The plane was dated and overall staff made the journey the worst flight I have ever experienced."

Checked in for the flight at Heathrow - am Etihad silver so can use the Business class desk to check in etc. Had a good chat to the lady who once she saw I was going to Manila was interested. Collected by boarding passes for the 2 outbound legs and headed to departure area. I was sat in boarding zone 5 so lot of people in gate area. Handed pass to be scanned and was pulled to one side and given a new boarding pass having been given an upgrade to business class which was a very nice surprise. Boarded via the upper jetway, warmly welcomed by cabin crew and took my seat. Had a glass of orange juice and made my food choice from the menu. The whole upper deck on Etihad A380 is premium seating and was very comfortable. 4 seats across in 1-2-1 arrangement however some seats are rearward facing. Seat was comfy and converted into a lie flat bed. Seat has a lift up space for anything loose you might have ie phone or book etc. Large touch screen with side control for the inflight entertainment system. After take off more drinks were served and food service began. You can specify a time to eat on the menu as well. Crew member prepared the table for my meal which I thought was delicious. After clearing away the meal service I settle down to watch a film or 2. Choice is good and operation of the system is quite straightforward. The external cameras on the A380 are a nice touch. Flight departed on time and arrived on schedule and after clearing security made my way to my next flight. Abu-Dhabi to Manila is a Boeing 777 which was looking a little tired inside (12 years old) and I was back in economy. Still a good flight with reasonable food and good cabin crew. Managed to sleep. Flight on time Manila - Abu dhabi flight was the same Boeing 777 and again the food was fine and crew attentive. Flight on time Abu dhabi to London - again on Airbus A380 and was upgraded to business class again. Flight was very good. Food was excellent. Choices were made from the menu before departure. The only minor snag I had was that my seat would not convert to lie flat bed. Cabin crew were able to resolve quickly. Overall I found the business class experience to be very good and would recommend to anyone."

However, our luggage were missing in Delhi (we had to pass them through custom) and we had to spend numerous filling forms. Arrived in Cochin, we expected to get our luggage the day after, but it didn't went like this. We had to Call numerous time to Etihad, Delhi / Munich / Amsterdam airport to try to find our luggage. Nobody seemed to know where there were. Finally Wednesday the 20th of December, almost one week later, we got our luggage back.  The problem were not finished. The day of our return flight, 3rd January, we were informed at the airport that our return flight Cochin-Abu Dhabi-Amsterdam-Oslo was cancelled, because we weren't on the flight on the way to India. I was standing there early 2am in the morning with my 2 children in the airport, the Etihad staff telling me that we had no way to come back to Oslo before one week later, since all flights in the following days were fully booked. In addition, I was supposed to pay for the return flight myself. I had to book a new flight with another company and got back to Oslo 36 hours later (!), with exhausted kid, and shocked by the service Etihad airways gave us."

The flight from London was delayed by 1 hour which is no big deal. During the flight as we approached Abu Dhabi, we ended up circling due to bad weather. On asking the flight staff, no one was able to advise what the next steps were. We eventually landed at Abu Dhabi and were advised to go to the Transfer Desk. They told us our plane was still there and to go to the gate. We go to the gate only to be told our seats had been given away and we had been offloaded. We questioned why and they were rude in their response and told us to go to the transfer desk. Someone 'helped' us by walking us to the transfer desk. All we wanted to know was when our next flight would be, which we only found out after queuing behind a 100 people and found out that it was in 7 hours. At no point was any rest place or accomodation advised or given and we had to argue in getting food vouchers rather than being offered them. We managed to see through the next 7 hours only to be confronted with more difficulty. We queued for our connecting flight only to be told we need to check in our hand carry. We insisted we were carrying medicine which we needed to keep, at which point the attendant shouted and threatened to deboard us from the plane if we didn't comply. After much stress managed to eventually get on to the flight. We arrived in MNL and waited for 2 hours in baggage only to find out 2 out of 3 of our checked in suitcases did not make it. As a result we were unable to give gifts and presents to our relatives for Christmas plus our clothes and personal effects were missing. On questioning where are luggage was, there was no explanation and we had to wait 24hrs before they could track our baggage. Etihad eventually got our luggage to us 3 days later although frustratingly no arrangement was made to drop it. They decided to call at 3am and demanded they drop it, irrespective of how inconvenient this was. We decided to rebook our return as the issues and delays stopped us from doing some important things. We called Etihad only to be told it would cost the price of 1 full priced ticket for us both. We explained our challenges on our outward trip but no attempt was made to assist us with our return flight. When we asked them to proceed on the back of the conversation the previous day they opened our ticket (essentially cancelling our original return ticket) they went on to explain it would actually cost the price of 2 tickets rather than 1 which they had previously advised. We argued that we would have only been happy to pay for the price discussed the day before and was not happy they had misinformed us. They left us no choice but to buy new tickets at full price due to an error on their part without considering the previous problems. A lot of this could have been avoided if they looked at helping their customers. Issues happen but under no circumstances should the customers be dealt with such blatant disregard. We have been lucky enough to have travelled with Emirates, Cathay Pacific, KLM, and Singapore whose customer service has been great and unfortunately Etihad do not deserve to be held anywhere near the same level as them. Their lack of professionalism and customer care left so much to be desired. Their follow up and lack of attempt to assist frustrated and tired customers also was shocking for such a high profile company. Avoid using them!"

The seats are slightly larger than they used to be, the staff are friendlier and they have a full entertainment system for their flights to Calicut unlike the others that fly the same route (except Qatar Airways). I had requested for the Low Calorie Meal which was served much earlier than the rest of the passengers which is always an advantage. What I did not appreciate was that the airline had to add more fuel for the flight to AUH from DMM since it did not carry enough. There was a fog in Abu Dhabi and they were advised to do so, delaying the flight by an hour. We landed with an hour to spare for my connecting flight. After another hour of delays and waiting on the runway on the plane to CCJ it finally took off. I don't blame them for the delay since the fog was really bad."

The journey from SFO-HYD was decent. They have comparable cabin service to Emirates, but their aircraft are somewhat old. The problem was during the return leg HYD-SFO. Don't ever go to their HYD check-in counter with even a single KG of extra baggage. I had just 1.1 Kg of extra baggage in my combined check-in luggage of 46KGs. I should have accounted for the Finance Textbook I added at the end. But little did I know that it would cause me so much hassle. First I thought they would be lenient and just let it go, but the guy was at the counter was rude and wanted me to pay the extra fee. I agreed to pay the additional price for the extra KG, but supposedly they have a flat rate of $125US. The guy was hurrying me to pay the additional fee and threatened me to get out of the line and to come back after throwing my luggage. He even mocked me that I will get further 15KGs if I buy the extra baggage and I can fill my bags with the Karachi biscuits they were selling at the airport. Terrible service. I was upset by this treatment as I didn't pay so much for such service. I called the manager, who was nice, but he wasn't helpful either. I was ready to throw my luggage, but I was not going to pay after the humiliation. I read their luggage policy and decided to carry my Textbook as a personal item (since they are not allowing an additional laptop bag, but a personal item now which they don't tell you about). It was a horrid experience. I will always avoid Etihad after this incident and wouldn't recommend the airline to my worst enemy. Stick to Emirates if you can!"

What a shambles. First time flying with Etihad and will be our last. Flew business class with my wife from LHR to Abu Dhabi and then onto Male. First flight was late leaving by an hour and despite being first off the plane the transfer at Abu Dhabi, it was shambolic. I have never seen crowds like it or so disorganised. It took one hour to get through and when we arrived at the lounge we had 5 mins there before boarding, time for a coffee only. Boarded the Male flight that departed at 8.40 only to be surprised they were serving lamb and chicken for in my view breakfast. We had lamb at 10.30pm UK time on London flight, was really looking forward to breakfast so ate nothing for a further 4 hours. No snacks, sandwiches or any savoury option available. So thank you Etihad I had no food for over 10 hours. You should be totally embarrassed by the fiasco at your main hub. Clearly you have significant transfers here and it is not fit for purpose. No priority channel until you get 2 yards from business security. This is entirely unacceptable and your food choice should be so much more on a business class flight from your hub.  I paid for business class for my wife and I on a wedding anniversary trip and got a poor economy service from Etihad. I had heard so many good things before flying, my experience is entirely different. Finally seating in business class was a fiasco too, we booked flights 5 months ago and still couldn’t get seats side by side in either flight. When we questioned this on the second flight they found 2 business seats together but why couldn’t we book them? Far from a great experience and look forward to reporting on the return leg very soon. Etihad you need to up your game, terrible experience and very poor value."

Extremely disappointed with the poor service and below average standards on our flights. We visit family in Germany every year and having flown other airlines (business class) we took our agents recommendation and flew Etihad Airways for the first time and most definitely the last time. I am taking the time to write this review just on 24 hours from getting home because my husband, daughter felt that we were (and other passengers) inconveniencing the crew. Their negative attitude and lack of professionalism were not acceptable. On a positive note checking in at Frankfurt Airport was excellent, easy and staff were friendly. However, from the moment we entered the aircraft we noticed the cabin crew rushing around, looking very stressed and un politely pushing passengers aside saying, “please move” to get past. At no time were we properly greeted or welcomed on board. The aircraft on our first leg of the journey was old and a bit shabby and the seats were not really comfortable. When we ordered our meal (I requested the lamb dish) I was told they had run out! After dinner was served the staff disappeared and were pretty much non-existent. Fortunately, it was only a 6.5 hr flight. However, the second leg of our flight 12.5 hrs was dreadful. Larger aircraft and seat/bed comfortable, our biggest disappointment again was the cabin crew. Except for one crew member who was somewhat polite the rest of the crew were unprofessional and just not visible during the flight. I requested a meal at about the 6-hr point of the journey and had to wait an hour – the food however (Grouper) was really good! My biggest shock came 1.5 hrs before landing in Melbourne when I woke up and requested a cup of coffee and some breakfast (they did not come to me I had to go to the galley). I was told by the female attendant that the ovens were turned off and they had no hot meals left. I explained that I had several hours in Melbourne to connect to Sydney and asked if I could maybe have a coffee and some toast to which the female crew member said, “you could get some breakfast and a better coffee in Melbourne”. I could give you more details about our whole journey but want to limit by saying I will not recommend Etihad to family and friends and certainly not fly Etihad again. I know that it is not Etihad's fault but Abu Dhabi Airport was also a nightmare - understandably a larger airport than Sydney but even though we were in transit everyone had to go through security checks (applaud this) but was chaotic and over crowed and understaffed.

S Fouris",,15th January 2018,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Abu Dhabi to Geneva,January 2018,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2,no,2,"  Abu Dhabi to Geneva. Extremely disappointed with Etihad Airways with which i am a GOLD member and frequent flyer to multiple destinations. My wife, my son and I were supposed to fly from Abu Dhabi to Geneva on January 3rd 2018 for a winter vacation. Upon check-in we noticed that my wife's visa starting date was on 4th of January (which is one date later). We were told that she cannot fly and hence requested to re-book the whole 3 of us for the following day and i showed willingness to pay extra fees for the reschedule. Howeverthe surprise came when we got told that if we do not take this flight 'Jan 3' we will lose the tickets since they were booked with miles. I called the Etihad contact center but there was absolutely no sign of cooperation. The tickets in dollar value are worth more than $5,500 - and I now had lost them all without 1 cent being returned except the tax which was around $510. I have tried all possible and proper ways with Etihad but not one time i was shown any kind of cooperation, their call center agents are all always in a hurry to finish the call as this is a dead case for them. I urge each and every one of you to be careful when booking next with Etihad as i have learnt it the hard way."

It was below average experience with a few good things to consider. Check in process was pretty efficient at Heathrow. The cabin crew were pretty serious and not even saying 'hi', overall pretty average. The food was surprisingly nice, the leg room was alright and the seats were comfortable enough. The entertainment system was ok, but it didn’t work for the first half hour and the last hour of the flight, when I questioned I was told that’s Etihads Policy, which didn’t really make much sense to me. It was pretty boring to sit and watch the flight map for the last hour of the flight. The other interesting thing was the first officer announced that we are traveling along the “Arabian Gulf”, I thought it was called “Persian Gulf”, I checked my google map again and I am certain it is Persian Gulf, it is like saying welcome to Qatar or Saudi once we land in Abu Dhabi. This was pretty stupid to me as I suppose the airlines must be accurate with their announcements. The last thing is Abu Dhabi Airport itself, I know it isn’t much to do with the airline or flight quality, but when you travel with Etihad you have to go past the airport and that airport is terrible, small and cramped with people with super dirty toilets. Overall, I would rather fly with Singapore Airlines, Emirates or Qatar much more than Etihad. A little saving not worth it."

Truly satisfying experience. The planes are very new and clean. All flights on time. Very professional ground staff and cabin crew. Very useful assistance during transfer in Abu Dhabi. Extremely comfortable seats. The entertainment system is great - lots of excellent movies and music, not a single chance to get bored. Quite interesting inflight magazine too. There are things to work on, though. The food quality have dropped significantly during the last couple of years - the meal was surprisingly mediocre and not tasty. Also, the Etihad mobile application tends to crash and depict errors causing the necessity to dial the call center for simple operations. The call center is rather useless though. For example I had failed to change my seats via application and asked to do so via call center, but the guy there was trying persistently to convince me, that the seating I required was not possible. Of course the issue was solved in 1 minute by the ground staff at the airport, luckily the seats that I wanted were still available."

This is the third time I have flown with Etihad and the service is just going downhill. The first leg of my trip was in Business Class and the second in Economy and there is definitely a difference in the way we are treated. The service in the first leg of my trip was excellent, the cabin staff were cordial and approachable. The second leg was  rubbish, they treated those in economy badly and I'd have to say it's just disappointing. My daughter wasn't feeling too well during the second leg of our trip as it was a long flight, the staff was very rude and passive aggressive to her and it was very frustrating to see. Will never fly with Etihad again, and I do not recommend it whatsoever."

I was flying from Toronto to Hyderabad, via Abu Dhabi. I would classify the service provided by the airline as very poor. It all started when my meals had to be served, I was offered a vegetarian meal, and I told the cabin crew very specifically that I would like to get a Non-veg meal. She made me wait for about 15-20 minutes and came back and firmly told me that there was no other option but a veg meal. I then requested for a drink, and was told that it would take about 15 minutes, I waited for about 30 minutes and then pressed the attendant button, the next attendant took another 15 minutes to fetch me a drink. My second leg of the trip was from Abu Dhabi to Hyderabad, and believe it or not, I once again was forced to have a veg meal. On my return from Hyderabad to Abu Dhabi, I was to break journey and head to Dubai by the travel coach provided by the airline. I tried to find out where I was to board the bus, but not too many people at the airport were friendly enough to give me the details. On the final route from Abu Dhabi to Toronto, I was confronted at the entry gates by a person who weighed by cabin bag, which was about 1 kg over the restriction, and they turned me back asking me to have the weight adjusted. I couldn't believe that they would be so strict with 1 kg. My overall experience puts me to think if I ever want to fly with this airline again. The cabin crew and the check in crew appear to be doing all the passengers a favor by working for this airline. I am sure if things don't change fast, this airline wouldn't last too long."

This last time I waited for 38 minutes before I was connected and the agent hung up supposedly because he couldn't hear me. Besides this, every agent that I spoke to is extremely rude beginning with an endless stream of questions to verify your identity all asked in the most impolite manner. I am already not looking forward to a pleasant experience when I fly tomorrow. I am rating the ground service, seat comfort and cabin staff service in advance since these are mandatory fields."

H Saunders",Boeing 787,6th January 2018,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Perth to Abu Dhabi,December 2017,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,4,no,5," Perth Airport was its usual excellent self. Unlike others, Perth appears to have little difficulty organizing hassle-free check-in and loading using an air-bridge to ensure a prompt (on the nose) push-back. Can't be faulted. For the flight, the seats on the 787 offer room enough for a six-footer, if a bit hard, but remember to bring your own eye mask and earplugs as these have been consigned to history by Etihad in the name of cost-cutting, probably best to use your own headphones too as those offered were defective. The ordered special meal - vegetable curry - served on departure was perfectly edible but likewise the little extras that Etihad once offered have disappeared. Deja vu as exactly the same meal was served again prior to arrival, which I could not be bothered with - some variation would have been nice, the second meal is not necessary on a 10 hour flight, a good quality snack / sandwich far preferable. Crew attentive throughout so no issues there. Like the live TV on the 787 but otherwise the IFE has similarly been cut back of late. Touch down at AUH was a few minutes early. However, as is the norm, for operational expedience the plane was subsequently parked at a distant location. Suffice it was an hour and a quarter before I eventually arrived in the terminal for the most part stuffed like a sardine in a cold, chronically overloaded bus with many elderly passengers and children. 5 minutes to whisk through the e-gate to pick up my bags that had arrived long since. Rather sad when the management of an airline and / or its principal airport hub treats luggage with rather more respect than its customers."

Still good but standards have slipped and they are clearly trying to economize. Little things like no pyjamas, no amenity kit on day flights, no a la carte menu in the Melbourne lounge. Nothing major but it does all add up. Entertainment this time around was a bit boring. I really struggled to find anything I really wanted to watch. We were in the Boeing 787 going to Dubai. Lovely plane. Only two working toilets though ( I think there should have been three) which meant we had to queue every time once for 20 mins which is a bit ridiculous. They’ve stopped offering chauffeur service outside of the UAE which is a real shame."

I had the most unpleasant traveling experience because of Etihad Airways! Due to time constraints, I had to purchase an airline ticket in a hurry, I chose Etihad, and I paid $2600.00 for a round-trip ticket for what was listed as Economy Flex. It was economy alright but the Flex part was an extreme exaggeration or someone's idea of a cruel joke on the unsuspecting traveler! I saw absolutely no difference between the economy class or the economy flex when it came to the room, as claimed by Etihad. The service was quite below standard, I had ordered a Kosher meal and when I got my meal in a box, half of the items in the kosher meal box were frozen. When I informed it to the air hostess, she told me that she couldn't do anything about that since she cannot microwave the food. I will not choose Etihad Airways for future travels."

I called their head office several times and got 4 different numbers to call. One was to their old baggage claim partners, who don't work with Etihad anymore. One number was out of service. One was to an office in Abu Dhabi, which was closed, and after 40 min on hold, I gave up on getting through to the 4th number.

They wouldn't give us a boarding pass until we entered the airport. During the flight the stewardesses were really nice, but the food was very limited in economy.

The flight crews are more attentive and smiling in providing quality service to passengers. A big change from past experiences. I had a combination flight of Business (Manila to Abu Dhabi) then Economy (Abu Dhabi to Brussels). In both flights, service was almost impeccable. There was also an impressive and much-welcomed amelioration in the lounge for Gold members who can now access more exclusive lounges: if flying from Terminal 1, it is now the one beside the Al Reem, which is much cosier than the latter and the food choices are a plenty. If flying from Terminal 3, Gold members are allowed at the Business Class Lounge. Before, I would only have access to this lounge when I flew business. Now, on economy flights, Gold members are welcomed here. The only area that still need improvements are the ground crews in Brussels. You hardly find anyone friendly here in the past but maybe now, I probably was just unlucky to be attended by someone new. Nothing of what I requested was arranged and he was not aware of the protocol for Etihad frequent flyer members. But the one whom he consulted (I supposed someone more senior) was already much better when he assisted, much better than the usual staff you find in the Etihad Brussels counters.  I just booked my children's flights with Etihad for January!"

First time on the new Boeing 787 and the cabin was new and well laid out. There is seating in the backward position which quite a few passengers were not keen on I noticed along with myself. Flat bed was still very narrow compared to Qatar and Cathay and  its very hard to move & turn over so it does feel a little claustrophobic. Get out of the seat to get into the aisle is very narrow and  not easy to do & I have my doubts if it was in emergency this would greatly hinder you chances of escape. Food was good on this flight and could be had at your pleasure when you needed to. Sadly the IFE is still poor and especially movies are not up to date and lacking in choice! Cabin crew were at-tentative until it was lights out then disappeared unless you buzzed them. Flight left late as seems to be the norm with this airline and arrived late as a consequence. On time departures must be tightened up as after all this is supposed to be a 5 star airline...

Not even a razor is supplied any more. It now basically contains only what the Etihad former business-class kit contained (which has been discontinued). The whole flight through I was never addressed by name, drinks have been only re-filled upon request and even for a hot towel after dinner I had to ask for. Upon arrival we could not de-board first (door 2 was opened first) and were brought late to the arrival hall in an overcrowded economy-class bus. At least passport control was fast and all my bags were on the belt when I finally arrived there."

How does Etihad get 5 stars rating, when their true standards are more like 3 stars? I chose them because they were the cheapest ticket (even less than China South Airlines!), but wish I had paid more. Seats were truly cramped, and the aircraft looked tattered but worse it was quite dirty. Bathrooms were disgusting near the end of the second flight. Food portions very small and cabin attendants seemed very unhappy to be serving (or not!). Used Qatar Airways last February and they are so much better."

She offered me another seat by the emergency exit row, which did not make any difference. Return flight from Abu Dhabi to New York was not a full flight yet it took nearly half an hour for the cabin crew to respond after hitting the button. Finally, we ended up walking to their kitchen every time we needed water. Food from JFK to AUH, the dinner was awful. Coming back to JFK from AUH, the food was excellent! Etihad did not offer me a choice of food for breakfast. Etihad needs to improve the cleanliness of their economy class cabin. Etihad could offer wifi onboard for free or at least improve the service. I purchased 5MB for 30 mins for $4.95 but it lost the connection within the first five minutes, while I still had 4.8MB left. Very disappointing!"

Lynn Wang",,12th November 2017,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Dusseldorf to Phuket via Abu Dhabi,November 2017,,,,,1.0,,1,no,1,"  Dusseldorf to Phuket via Abu Dhabi. Several people in Etihad’s customer service (by email and on the hotline) gave us different answers. This is disappointing and confusing for us. Several times their customer service confirmed to accept our ticket via email on 20.08 and hotline on 07.11 that we will able to check in. They booked us into their system (however only the return flight instead of both flights). After we called customer service on 07.11 again, Etihad employee sent us a ticket (both ways), and confirmed again that with this ticket we will be able to check into our flight. Since on 10.11. one flight was still not visible on Etihad website, we called the hotline again. We were then informed that they won't accept our ticket. We are left confused if Etihad will honor their previous promises. Also we are very unhappy with this behavior. If they make promises they should keep them. If they don't intent to keep promises then better don't make any promise at all. Now we have buy new tickets shortly before we fly, which are very expensive now, comparing to 3 months ago. I already contacted the consumer protection organisation about this topic. Also I want to warn other potential customers to be very cautious before putting trust into them by sharing my story."

This is not review about the flight itself but the customer service and the user experience. The problem for me started when I arrived at the airport and they noticed that my wife switched my name and surname when registering the ticket. They notified me that the ticket is invalid and I cannot use it at all. I had to buy a new ticket which cost me 2x more than the one I already had. Since the problem was that only name and surname were switched, this is something that is totally unacceptable to me. When I arrived at Bangkok I tried to get in touch with the airline to learn if I can be at least partly refunded for the ticket that I was not able to use. On the web they say to contact them over Facebook page so I did. The response on the messenger took a few hours but they said to send the question over email. So I did. No responses after 5 days. I found online also the email address to where I wrote the same question. No responses yet after 3 weeks except the autoreply that they will look into my request. After not getting any response I tried also calling them. Their phone service is terrible. You are guided through multiple level of selections such as ""for english press 1"", ""if you bought your ticket online press 1"". At the deepest level you always reach a stage where they say they explain that you should find you answer somewhere else and that the call will now end. Horrible service, especially since these are all international calls. At just one of these deepest levels I was able to finally get a person to whom I was able to speak. They explained to me that the ticket cannot be refunded and that I can even be happy that they don't charge me additional money for not showing up. The last straw for my dissatisfaction with the airline was the checking in to return back home. I tried to check in online one day before and all seats were already marked as non-available. I assumed I simply need to choose the seat when I check in at the counter. I was one of the first people at the counter 4 hours before the flight. The person who checked me in was a trainee without any experience. She said that there are no seats available anymore next to the window on the two connected flights that I had with the airline. This is simply unbelievable and it's simply a way for them to charge additional money for people being able to choose seats."

The next leg to Manchester was very different with a much older plane, rather poor entertainment and food was no where near as good as from Singapore. Then, when flying back from Manchester it all went rather wrong. We had to queue up for well over an hour and a half, when we eventually arrived at the at the check in desk the guy wanted an 150GPB to check in the bike I had brought from Singapore to Manchester without any extra cost. He stated we were only allowed one bag each, there seemed to be time so I wanted to repack my bag slightly and only check my bike bag, he would not allow me to do this an insisted we paid the 150GPB or we would miss our flight. On the next counter to us a couple were having similar issues. We tried our best though there was no other airline staff around and the check in staff are not employed by Etihad so there was nothing they could do really. We paid up and then got to the boarding to find out the flight was delayed an hour, then it was delayed even longer which meant we would miss our connecting flight. It wasn't all bad as we were put up in an excellent hotel with great food and the plus for me was that I was able to now watch the McGregor vs Mayweather fight. The other upside is that we chatted with the other couple who had isses in the next isle to us and they informed us about the regulations. If a passenger flying out of the UK is more than 6 hours delayed they are entitled to 600euro / person. After lots of emails and proof of our flights we eventually got our 600/each from Etihad. I'll pay the extra and fly with Qatar Airways next time for sure. I will add my scores would be much better as the Singapore side is excellent, the Manchester side really let's the whole airline down."

J Coney",,7th November 2017,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Rome to Melbourne via Abu Dhabi,November 2017,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2,no,1,"  I flew from Melbourne to Berlin with Etihad Airways, as I am gluten intolerant, I had ordered a special meal - on one leg of the flight, this was given to another passenger. Because Etihad code share with Air Berlin, with Air Berlin going into liquidation, our return bookings were cancelled and changed around 4 times. I was supposed to be flying out of Berlin, but they thought it would be easy to just fly out of Dusseldorf or Munich - both 5 hour train trips or maybe to get across to Serbia and fly from there. The final solution offered was to fly from Berlin with Alitalia to Rome, hang around in the airport for 8 hours and then join up to Abu Dhabi and fly back to Melbourne - this equated to a very long journey. On checking in with Alitalia, they decided that my 15kgs of extra luggage would be charged at Euro 344 for the journey. Note that I had tried to put in the excess baggage through the Etihad website, but it does not allow you to do this - so you are zapped at the airport with a large charge that you are then not in a position to find options for. The travel documentation indicates that the cost for an extra bag is US$ 185.00, however this is not the case. I shipped a 30kg suitcase door to door from Germany for Euro 280 so you can see how bad this charge is. On the flight, once again no special meal so the crew had to find bits of fruit for me to eat - they blame this on Flight Centre and Flight Centre say the meal request was definitely in the system - who is lying? Both totally incompetent. A totally dreadful experience and will never fly with them or recommend them again. Beware, the flights look cheap but you get what you pay for, squashed seats, bad service, indifferent staff and dreadful food. Add to that dirty bathrooms, in one, no toilet roll and do yourself a favour and fly another airline."

The first flight from Jakarta to Abu Dhabi was an Etihad operated flight, the last two flights were Air Serbia operated flights. For those, who do not know Air Serbia: Etihad owns 49% of that airline and manages it. The first flight was a night flight, departing 0:10 am. My seat was not reclining as it should. It was going back to normal position, when I leaned forward a little. The flight attendant confirmed that the seat has a defect, and told me, she would try to find a solution. Well, nothing happened, not even a feedback. After 23 hours of travelling with Etihad (including waiting times at the airports), I was about to start my final flight to Berlin at Belgrade on time. While waiting in the airplane I fell asleep, just to wake up 20 min. after regular departure time, because of the pilot's announcement: All passengers would need to leave the airplane due to a technical error. Then, we needed to wait, without knowing, what would happen next. This took around 3 hours. The airline provided water and apple juice for free but no information. Then, the flight was cancelled. The ground staff told us, that we would get new tickets immediately and after that we would stay in a hotel to catch our new flight connection on the next day. What they did not tell us: Everybody would need to wait until all new tickets are issued. No option to buy food is available at that part of the airport. After that, we would be transfered directly to the hotel. This happened another 2 hours later. While waiting for the new tickets to be issued and in the bus for the other passengers whose tickets have not been issued yet, no food was provided. So 5.30 hours after the regular departure time, I was checking in at the hotel. It was 11.40 pm local time and they were about to pick me up at 4 am the next day, so that I could catch my flight in the morning at 6.35 am. At the hotel we were finally provided a food bag, with a sandwich in it, an apple, drinkable yoghurt and chocolate mousse...The hotel kitchen was closed already...too late. The spa was also closed by the way. Well, I did not get any sleep that night, because I was so afraid of missing my next flight, because I was super tired. All in all, the way I was treated as a customer was semi-professional. I would probably choose a different airline next time."

The team had a very hospitable and caring attitude and never seemed like we were bothering them at all if we needed anything. My husband was very sick and had sinus pressure pain in his face, one of the girls kept coming to check on us and got us a hot towel, and followed up later on to check on him. They really went above and beyond compared to other airlines we have been with before. I even forgot my phone on the plane when landing in Chicago and the captain and manager took it and saw me running back and returned it to me, then followed up with us a few minutes after about our baggage just to check on us. The most professional and kind international team I ever flew with. Recommended for anyone traveling to or around the Middle East."

J Kaiser",Boeing 777-300ER,27th October 2017,Solo Leisure,First Class,Munich to Abu Dhabi,October 2017,2.0,3.0,,1.0,3.0,,2,no,6,"  Munich to Abu Dhabi in First class. I flew Eithad to the US twice before from the UAE in first and raved about the food, service and comfort on its 380. So roll on three years forward and a business class booking where I spent good money to upgrade to first from Munich to Abu Dhabi​ where​ the experience could not have been more different and disappointing. The outbound flight EY04 Boeing 777-300 seat was the first shock since clearly these seats had seen a better day and for the most part unless fully extended was uncomfortable. The leather padding kept moving around and thus prone to slide in the sitting position. Unlike the two prior trips where the first class seating was big enough to seat two people these seats were not. The aircraft seemed old and worn unlike the new 777’s which are great to fly. The food options were greatly diminished from prior Etihad flights and I was a bit shocked to see just how uninteresting the menu was. I ordered food but then decided to cancel since sleep was needed. I did not feel like I missed anything and other reviewers confirmed it. I would have liked something to munch on even though the plane had less than an hour before landing but the answer was no. Really not even a breakfast roll? I had to keep asking for coffee refills but at least I got that. Very different from my prior Etihad flights​ where service was outstanding​.​ ​ The movie selection was mediocre and not worth turning on to watch the films available. The other on board surprise was the FC toiletries that were handed out. An oversized bag with tiny samples of lotion or toothpaste. Etihad no longer carries the Bergamonte brand it did ​previously​ and clearly my bag was exactly the same as business. Etihad use to be much more generous in its offering both size and quality of products. Once I passed immigration I decided to stop into the arrivals lounge for a bite to eat since I missed my meal and the food offerings there were a joke. Some tiny sandwiches tea, juice or coffee. So I passed and decided to wait until I reach my hotel. Etihad has also cheapened its car service by insisting you buy a full fare ticket before you have access to the service. At first their worthless customer service said no but I tried requesting again online and got a confirmation of service so I was able to use it. The supervisor in the line of cars awaiting Etihad passengers had to argue with four of the drivers before one would agree to take me as I was not that far from the airport. I was shocked to watch them go back and forth. The value if I had booked a car service they recommended for the discounted FC passengers from AUH to ​the Intercontinental​ $35. Now Etihad has become so cost cutting that on a $5500 ticket they didn’t want to cover the $35 cost or even pay for the $20 taxi ride to my hotel? So average service, mediocre food, worn out first class seating, unnecessary rules for first class car service; just adds up to a second class airline in all major categories when looking at their competition. It was the initial pricing and prior experience which hooked me into grabbing a seat. I just wish I had read the other reviews before booking as I would have taken another choice."

I have to share the sentiment of most of the recent reviews about Etihad posted here. I was happy to get an A380 from Paris to Abu Dhabi compared to a. ageing 777-300 I flew recently and then a 787 for the second flight. Both aircraft were nice and new but the service and food were just lacking. What was particularly frustrating was that the entertainment system offers a food and drink section but it was always unavailable and never worked on either flight. Food was average and as others said I wasn’t given a choice for the second meal on the Brisbane leg of the flight. The in-flight service was very disappointing as I rarely saw the flight attendants at all and I had to press the call button just to get a tiny cup of water. I have flown other airlines that have been very attentive but Etihad seem to train their staff to do as little as possible in order to save money on snacks and beverages. The entertainment on offer is also limited compared to other airlines. I’ve been with Qantas and Emirates who have a much wider variety of films and tv shows to watch than Etihad do. What also annoyed me is that on the Paris to Brisbane leg they locked the tinting on the windows so it was really dark on the aircraft despite being daytime. I was looking forward to seeing the beautiful Western Australian coastline from my seat but was prevented from doing this by the flight crew. I was unable to edit the window settings as they had been locked out. There does seem to be an element of cost cutting at play which has resulted in poor service. I feel that Etihad may have once been a good airline but they have gone downhill. Avoid and fly with someone else.

Had to ask again and wait another ten minutes before the wine bottle came by. No amenity bag, but ear plugs offered on request! Cost saving measure? Cabin crew seemed to be a bit inexperienced and swamped. Not visible in cabin other when rushing back and forth to seats, which may explain they were on a minimum number. More cost cutting? The Miracle lounge prior to departure was okay, rather a bar with snacks than a fully fledged business lounge. The outbound flight was okay but not any of the ""wow"" experiences I have had in the past with other airlines. Altogether, not overly impressed. I could recommend compared to KLM or any American airline, but compared to Singapore Airlines and Qatar Airways, no."

Airport staff was helpless as well. Eventually I received my baggage after two days in my destination airport after frantic private phone investigation at airlines and airports.

Richard Clarke",Boeing 777,10th October 2017,Solo Leisure,First Class,Melbourne to Abu Dhabi,October 2017,1.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3,yes,6,"  Etihad have this system that you can bid on a flight upgrade and I decided to give this a go and got upgraded to First Class on my Melbourne to Abu Dhabi flight. Cabin had only 8 seats and you had good privacy. The staff were very professional in catering to your needs. Food was very well prepared and tasted good, you could eat whenever you needed which is a given in this class of cabin. The First class seat is such a big disappointment as its only on a par with Qatar's business class seat. No mattress was offered, no proper pillow either and these seats have aged a lot, it was very uncomfortable lying down I hardly got any sleep. Again TV on demand was only average compared to Qatar and Emirates and we are talking first class here. I don't think its worth the upgrade from the business class offering but at least you are given the chance to bid which is fun."

Horrible economy class experience onboard Etihad Airways. The service was very bad, the cabin crew did not show the service standard that they should have, no menu provided. After the meal service, there are no water services. The configuration of 777W is horrible, the economy class seat was old and uncomfortable. The meals tasted alright but there is not enough food for the flight from Sydney to Abu Dhabi as the flight is around 14 hours. There is no choice for the second meal service."

J Lim",,5th October 2017,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Ho Chi Minh City to New York via Abu Dhabi,August 2017,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,1,no,1,"  Ho Chi Minh City to New York via Abu Dhabi. Stay, stay away from Etihad at all costs. I had one single trip booked from SGN to JFK, with worst experience ever in my almost 30 years of flying. I've read good stories and recommendations on Etihad, and conveniently there was a good flight from SGN to JFK with one stop at (Abu Dhabi) a very convenient time at 8:00pm, arriving around 10am at JFK. Flight got cancelled and booked for another flight 9 hours later: aircraft issue - understandable. I was offered hotel and rides back and forth upon my arrival at the airport - still understandable. I did not take this offer because I wanted to spend more time with my family. Due to this flight delay, my whole itinerary changed: SGN-AUH-IAD-JFK. There was another flight straight from AUH-JFK but regretfully missed by few min, but they weren't going to let me on that plane anyway - I paid for a one stop flight. I was boarding for flight from AUH and heard an Etihad staff yelling at a passenger in a line to move away? The passenger looked so dumbfounded. Extremely unprofessional behavior. Arrived and found out flight was cancelled from IAD to JFK. They did not offer me hotel (did offer a discounted rate), nor another method of ride to JFK that night. Had a meeting at work the next morning, how inconveniently arrived just a night before the meeting due to delays and cancellations. Therefore, I decided to take a train, but I had to wait for my luggage at an office, and the lady there, who was associated with JetBlue, got me on a free shuttle from IAD to JFK (Which I truly appreciated). Overall, my flight was extended by 12 hours, arrived 15+ hours later than expected, extra costs I spent at the airport. After this incidence, I requested for a refund of my ticket or at least get compensated for the cancelled flight that I never took and for the major changes (one stop flight -> two stops). They did offer me some compensation after 2 months, and I received 15,000 miles on Etihad. I can't even go anywhere with 15,000 miles. I argued that I deserve more, but they reviewed and concluded that was enough for me, they said. I received the miles just because I might be able to transfer these miles to another airlines that I take, if not, it's just going to rot there. I will never be taking Etihad again, and will strongly recommend against it. Just thinking about my experience with Etihad makes me so angry.."

Michael Goczol",A330,3rd October 2017,Couple Leisure,First Class,Frankfurt to Ho Chi Minh via Abu Dhabi,September 2017,3.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,2,no,2,"  Ho Chi Minh to Frankfurt return via Abu Dhabi. Etihad Airways losing its stars and reputation. After a disappointing outbound experience I hoped for the better this time. But check-in in Frankfurt was very bad, again: Staff seemed to be demotivated, overworked and arrogant. Our request to add an extra bag within our maximum weight allowance was rejected and ground staff even started to argue with us that the information on this matter given to us by Etihad before in writing was wrong and that we were lying to them. The Etihad-lounge in Frankfurt, before one of the best lounges in the world, was shut down. Instead we have been offered Lufthansa Senator-lounge, which is a business-class lounge only. So no first class lounge access even for a fully paid first class flight and instead of a steak grilled to order or other individually cooked items only turkey sausages were our hot dinner-option in Frankfurt, since we wanted to sleep on the short night flight to Abu Dhabi. The next bad surprise was that Etihad – in order to cut costs – does not even cater on board any local newspaper or magazine from its departure-countries any more. Only English and Arabic language papers from Abu Dhabi were available – which were outdated. Staff on board was friendly and professional, and we had a good sleep on board. Upon arrival in Abu Dhabi, priority delivery-service was not working and we had to wait for about 45 minutes for our luggage. Etihad also cancelled it’s free chauffeur service. The counter after arrival was closed and we have been sent by a cheap 8-seater-taxi to our hotel rather than a limousine. Check-in at Etihad’s 1st Class counter in Abu Dhabi was again a disaster: bossy staff that neither greeted us nor helped re-packing our baggage because one piece they said was overweight, even though we checked in the same piece with Etihad in FRA 2 days before with no problem. My request for helping us with some Scotch-tape to re-seal the 2 boxes we had to open for re-packing was ignored, the check-in lady did not even leave her chair to look for it, and instead we were requested to seal them for a hefty fee by an outside supplier. Because of the request of re-packing without proper packing materials some valuable crystal items arrived broken. Communication was very unfriendly, too: instead of asking my wife for her passport, the check-in agent was just waving my passport at us and asked us: ‘who flies’? The agent also checked not our seat-requests and we first did not get our assigned seats. Our flight was leaving from T1, yet no information at check-in that Etihad only has one first class lounge in T3 - where we checked in. So we walked more than 15 minutes through the hectic Abu Dhabi airport from T3 to T1 and back to T3. At least the service on board was spotless, even though you could feel the cost-cutting when it came to the food and beverage-selections. Upon arrival, we were greeted by the airport manager, who helped us through passport control. In conclusion, savings in catering and staff, resulting in overworked and arrogant check-in agents, stop of chauffeur-services and denied access to a 1st class lounge are making even 1st-class flying with Etihad a pain. The only good thing is that the staff on board still remains friendly and professional, as before. Other than that Etihad does not live up to its 5 star rating."

M Kumar",,2nd October 2017,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Manchester to Sydney via Abu Dhabi,September 2017,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,,1,no,1,"  Manchester to Sydney via Abu Dhabi. Extremely appalling service by the callous staff at Manchester. I am a frequent flyer and travelled all the continents. This time I was carrying my usual hand luggage and they did not allow me to carry it as its small wheels were not fitting in the frame. Whilst I stated that I have been using this in many flights none had any objection they did not budge. We are different was their response. Then to add insult to injury asked me to pay £160.0 as it was the airline fee for additional bag. As my first check in bag hardly had 16kg, I was told to transfer stuff in it and throw the hand bag away. When I tried to transfer stuff in checked in hand bad it became 24.0kg and they would not even allow for that. I have been trying to contact their UK office and spoke to them three times regarding my luggage issue. They make notes but when you ask them to refer to those they come back saying we do not trust these notes we will listen to the recorded communication and get back to you. They never come back. This airline is pathetic with callous staff. This is my last booking with them. "

So disappointing after expecting a good standards airline. The lounge in CDG was nice looking, but food choice very bad. Seat was okay, but Boeing 777 was dirty cabin and seats smelled, portion of the food served worse than economic class, and the experience was very discount. Staff were nice when I saw them but they have to be called for and they are not in the cabin like most airlines. Abu Dhabi airport stopover was a busy time and the lounge space very bad, we could not find 2 seats together. I read 2 weeks previously this airline was in a bad position and think that the flight standards would not change, but everything about this trip was below normal business class levels."

Having made the decision to go business class, we were very disappointed with the cabin service in particular. After taking our order, it took at least an hour for the meal. One meal was 3 hours (had to be rerequested) and one was 2. One coffee never arrived. The staff after finishing meal service, disappeared and there was no way to call for service apart from finding them. Neither could we find a service bell. Wifi didn't work on any leg, and we couldn't charge iPads. The seats on the plane from Perth were uncomfortable, but did fold down to a flat bed. Same movies on all 4 legs, over a month apart."

Not anymore. Since Etihad is in financial turmoil and cost-cutting became its No. 1 priority, lounges are closed, service turned sour and savings on dining and wining even in Etihad’s First Class are the new, disappointing standard. Because of staff-reductions, we had to wait 15 minutes at check-in at SGN-airport. Reason: staff was checking in Business-Class guests at Etihad’s First-Class counter. Formerly an absolute no-no. Boarding was chaotic, as well: no priority boarding and we had to queue with all other 200+ passengers. The welcome on board was warm, yet the standard of service is dropping down: instead the traditional collection of 3 different snacks only nuts were served and even though it was only 3 passengers in First, my wife and me could not get the requested mixed vegetables, because they ‘run out of it’ already. The amenity-kit, formerly a traditionally designed and waved pouch of high quality was replaced by a cheap plastic version and mine was used already (pouch with lip-balm, etc. missing). The interior of the aircraft, an old A340 was outworn and some of the buttons for the remote of the Personal Entertainment system and the seat were not working properly any more. Staff, however, was friendly and caring. On the stopover I also visited the Etihad 1st Class lounge in Abu Dhabi, which is excellent. But waiting times in the restaurant increased significantly and waiting more than 2 hours for a morning-shave is unacceptable. Our continuing flight to Frankfurt was on a remote gate. Yet, 35 minutes before boarding no bus for 1st and business-class passengers was available. Had to wait with all other passengers for more than 20 minutes. No seat available, thus standing. Entering the aircraft by stairs was hectic, people were squeezing each other, so we decided to board last. Pre-flight service was hectic because the bus arrived just 5 minutes before departure but at least the inflight-service was flawless. Upon arrival no arrival service and our luggage was delivered late, even though we had priority and first-class stickers on them. I always have been a fan of Etihad and enjoyed its perfect lounges, services and friendly staff. But cost-cutting effects even Etihad’s most loyal (Platinum-member) and revenue-contributing (flying 1st-class) customers to such a degree, that the great flight-experience, I am paying for, hardly exists any more. No first-class lounge-access except Abu Dhabi, long waiting lines, worn out cabin interior, bad catering, no luggage-priority, no free chauffeur-service (except Abu Dhabi, were taxis are offered instead). All in all a very disappointing experience."

As I approached the check in area the check in staff were having a conversation. I waited for them to finish there said conversation before I handed my passport. After a few security questions I was checked in and directed to the fast check security , I did so and was greeted by the most welcoming man with a warm smile (a Heathrow staff member) who checked my boarding pass and wished me a safe flight. After browsing the duty free shops I made my way to gate 10 where the Etihad Airways lounge is located. On entertaining the lounge I met two lovely welcome hosts who asked if my luggage and suit bag would like to be stored. She then offered me the WIFI slip. The first impression of the lounge was dark and small. I passed about 6 staff who were standing there like zombies no more then a smile. I had a walk around before I sat in the ala carte section where I thought I would have a nice lunch. There were pre set menus on the table so I had a look and went for the salmon salad of which I ordered after attracting the attention of one of the staff. I asked for a glass of Chardonnay and some sparkling water and was told I had to help my self from the buffet area. I found that very strange considering I was sat in the restaurant area expecting restaurant service? The salad arrived in super quick time (with no salad only x2 baby potatoes cut into 4 pieces, green beans, 2 cherry tomatoes also cut into 4 pieces and a splash of balsamic dressing) -  the salmon was very moist clearly being sat in a steamer until an order came in. After my salad-less salad I fancied a coffee so decided I leave the lounge and head to Costa Coffee as the Etihad coffee machine had seen better days. Boarding was called and like you'd expect everyone marched up to the gate in one go only to be turned away as there zones were not yet called. A warm welcome from the crew as I boarded and found my seat 16A. Business seats are incredible and should be rolled out on all Etihads long haul business class. The flight was fantastic, service standards won back from that I had in the lounge. Only downside they have taken the wash bags away and only offer these on night flights! Explained by the crew member with a nervous smile. Items like toothbrush, socks were available but you had to ask. Cutting back things in the premium cabins never goes down well with crew or the paying passengers who expect it. My connection in Abu Dhabi was very long so enjoyed a bit of quiet time and sleep in the lounge. when I finally boarded my flight to Phuket I slept most of the way. Overall opinion on my experience was a fantastic airline but need touching up on the outstations service style to be more consistent."

Flew out of Sydney in business class on a Boeing 777, my first time on Etihad Airways since 2014, and what a major disappointment. The airline is clearly suffering big time after all the losses I read about, but what is worse are the cutbacks they have made. No proper amenities, pyjamas etc available, and food was really no different to economy class standards on Thai Airways that I flew via Bangkok in April this year (except on Thai it was served hot, and cooled down to almost cold on Etihad). I spoke (complained I guess!) with two very nice staff about the cuts and they expected much more to come and seemed very downbeat about their jobs. After suffering the appalling zoo of Abu Dhabi airport my connecting flight to London was an A380. While the plane was nicer, it was a repeat showing of a sub-standard business class. I nearly booked business with Qatar Airways but chose Etihad as they were AUS$200 cheaper - a bad decision!"

My daughter and myself had a return flight (Economy class) from LAX to IKA. The flight was scheduled for 4:55pm. We arrived at the airport around 2:15pm and waited in the line for the checking-in process. After around 50 minutes, it was our turn. When the lady with light brown and skirt weighed our 4 luggage pieces, each had between 2-3Kg overweight which was a bit higher than what we had found in home weighing them. In fact, by seeing the overweight of the first one, she did not want to weigh the rest of them which we insisted to see if the total was lower than the maximum allowed weight when she finally agreed. When she saw the overweight, she asked us either to pay the overweight fee or reduce the weight somewhere else and then go to the end of the line and said that it was the policy. This was unfair to us which had waited in the line for about 50 minutes which was long and also the check-in line had not been shorten by then anyways.  Also, nobody had told us about the policy and asked us to check the weights before it becomes our turn for check-in. We reduce the weight to below 46 Kg for each of us. Then, I complained to the lady who said that she was the supervisor and finally, as an exception of the policy, she directed us to a different line than the normal one which took us the same time as that of the original line. The check-in finished around 4:00pm (close to two hours for the check-in process) and we had to go to the passport control and security check with the 55 minutes left for us. This took longer than usual. Finally, we got to the gate five minutes to departure gate when luckily there was about 30 minutes delay of departure time which we did not know. Now, that you very strict on the maximum allowed weight, you should let your passengers know ahead of time about this and ask/direct them to weight their luggage pieces in the airport with scales that are in the counter before staying in the queue. I guess that that is the minimum that I could expect. The airline might consider us as just two passengers not caring about this insulting experience but this was my first and probably the last flight with Etihad Airways and I will not recommend this airline."

Rather shocked to hear this I asked her to confirm the bassinet arrangements for my infant. She was rude and petulant - unbecoming of a good customer service agent. The service on board was nothing to write home about. We had an A380 on the London to Abu Dhabi sector and an A320 for Abu Dhabi to Kochi. The stewardesses hardly cared or bothered how we were coping with our little baby. It seemed just giving us a bassinet was the most they could do. One Arabic boy who cried a lot got a lot of attention. I felt there was preferential treatment toward people based on their appearance and ethnicity. Most of the cabin crew seemed to be Eastern Europeans or Arabic. The meals were disappointing: portions were small and not very tasty. The only good points were the aircraft, which were in good condition, and the inflight entertainment systems. I thought overall the airline was lacking in basic customer service skills and I would avoid it in future."

My inbound flight to LAX from AUH had no issue.

What they did serve seems to confirm everything I had read that Etihad is in trouble! Small meal portions, poorly heated and well below biz class standards. Part of my trip out to Singapore GP this was a cheap late ticket, and I am so relieved we are booked with a group to fly back on Qatar Airways, who seem to be one of few airlines to maintain their quality standards.

I have flown this airline a number of times in the past, but I will do everything in my power to avoid doing do in future. This airline has been cutting corners for a while now, despite the contention that it is a five star airline. This is a long distance budget airline. It cuts costs by, for example, in Dublin, sharing the budget terminal with Ryanair. Recently, like other budget airlines, it has been enforcing carry on baggage rules - 7kg for a carry on bag, 5kg for a second bag. They will force you to juggle weight around your various hold/ carry-on luggage until you meet the required standards. They quote ""safety restrictions' despite the fact that even other 'budget' airlines allow a carry-on limit of 10kg. They won't listen to reason if you point out that the plane will carry all the combined weight of one's luggage in any case. They will insist that you go to the end of the queue to carry out this farce. And finally, if you have anything fragile, they won't, of course, allow you to carry it in the cabin, but will force you to put it in the hold. They broke my guitar in this way. They even forced me to sign a waiver, stating that I was not entitled to any compensation if it should get damaged on route. When I refused to sign the waiver, they said they wouldn't take it. The result, of course, was a cracked and unplayable guitar. Thanks Etihad, thanks for breaking my guitar! If this isn't enough, the old terminal in Abu Dhabi is an outdated, confused mess, with constant queues for malodorous, inadequate toilets, and smoking rooms that resemble old telephone boxes. I will do everything in my power to use their competitors for that route, Qatar Airways, Emirates or Turkish Airlines and urge others to do the same."

Lounge in Abu Dhabi fine, but the airport is creeking at the seems, all flights were by buses with the exception of BKK. Lounge in Bangkok small but fine. It is now evident cost cutting is now severely in place, no more Limos, no more wash bags, cheaper wines and the food onboard is Economy. It was a joke, outbound to BKK was a two egg omelette, with a tomato/ bread and tea. I kid you not, they have reduced the snacks to three offerings being chicken and crisps. The return was soup or mezze, mains were insulting with Biryani (rice), chicken breast with mash or Veg pasta. I must say the outbound crew were super and professional but the return looked like they all hated each other and the atmosphere was evident. Standards are slipping badly but to top it off the attitude of the ground staff has never been good in Abu Dhabi, they all need intense training on customer service and get them engaged or else fire them as they have a rude, lazy, arrogant attitude. One particular was the man boarding the outbound flight to BKK, he snatched my passport, didn't even look at me, was too busy laughing with his colleague and then with out looking at me still, thrust the passport back in my face still laughing with his colleague.

We flew MRS to AUH via Paris CDG, arriving in AUH at 7.30pm, and in spite of a 2 hours transfer lag our 5 pieces of luggage did not make it to Abu Dhabi, like the luggage of another 20 people, even if our luggage were appearing as loaded in Etihad system. After being asked to wait for an hour or so, as they were confident they would locate the luggage in AUH Airport, we were finally asked to file a report as the luggage were definitely somewhere in Paris CDG Airport. Finally left the airport after 2 hours and a half of confusion and chaos as the baggage claim department is undersized, especially since this was a very busy week end. We had high hopes that our luggage would arrive on the next morning as an Etihad flight arrives daily as well at 6.40am from Paris, but unfortunately we saw in the baggage tracking website that they were planned to arrive only on the 7.30pm flight. So 24 hours after our original flight we rang Etihad who informed us that someone would get in touch this same evening to arrange the delivery of our 5 bags. The next morning, as we had not heard anything from Etihad, I rang the luggage service a dozen of times, before getting an answer, to learn that they finally only had 4 of our 5 bags, in spite of what was told us the night before. After insisting, and shouting a bit, they finally went to look for the 5th bag and rang me back to tell me it was finally found and that we could come and pick our 5 bags. Delivery was not possible due apparently to some new requirements of customs who want people there in case a bag needs to be opened. At 6pm, so nearly 48 hours after our original flight, we reached at the airport to collect our bags and there they tell us they have only 4 bags out of the 5. And the cherry on the cake, is that the missing bag is not the same as the one that was thought missing in the morning! So they had found all 5 and lost one again. After another bit of shouting and a couple of hours, we were promised by the supervisor that they would find the bag and bring it home the same night. Drove back home with the 4 bags, and at 9pm received a call from a guy on his way to deliver the 5th bag, which finally reached us at 10pm. Apparently the ""you need to come and pick up because of customs” rule had mysteriously disappeared. I could sincerely not believe to have this type of service and complete lack of professionalism from a so called 5 Star Airline. No information if we had not called (on line tracker has still not been updated 2 days after), understaffed baggage department that never picks up the phone, complete disorganization, poor management and complete lack of customer service. If you add to this the very poor service onboard and the low quality of catering, this leads to a clear decision : never again Etihad."

A 13.5 hours flight with 2 meals only.  The first meal was an indian breakfast served after 4 hrs in air with no other options and I don't eat spicy food saying that the second meal will be a 3 options meal. After 11 hours comes the second meal where I was expecting a decent one but Etihad Airways continued to surprise me with a vegetarian meal saying that this is only what is left, which i didnt accept. One of the senior cabin crew members came for appologies and offered me a crew meal saying that Etihad Airways will contact me about this issue but that never happened. My return flight September 4th, I checked in online and chose my seat which was 45D. When i dropped my baggages at the check in counter and i was boarding, i found out that my seat was changed to 67D on the boarding pass. I asked the guy at the gate and he says that seat 45D is a paid seat and he had to move me to 67D. How did you let me check in and choose a paid seat without telling me that or asking for an extra fee? And how do you change my seat without at least notifying me or asking me where i would like to sit? What if i wanted to pay for that seat even though the plane that day was half empty. Shame on Etihad Airways to have such a bad service that i have never seen before even in small airlines companies.  Well you really disappointed me and im never booking again thats for sure. "

My bag was delayed, arriving Chicago the day after I arrived. That happens occasionally, and in itself would have been acceptable. What is not acceptable is that Etihad took many escalations over 8 days after arrival to trace and deliver the bag. Further, Etihad is trying to avoid issuing the nominal reimbursement I sought under the guise of legalese. This is absolutely unprofessional behaviour all around. Once the bag arrived in Chicago airport, it seems to have vanished into a black hole. The status file disappeared from the baggage tracing link on Day 2. On Day 3 and 4, Phones to the number at Airport were not picked up. Emails sent to airport got no answer. Tweets to etihad got no response. It took three calls to Customer Service (over next 4 days) before I reached a manager who could reach airport manager who initiated delivery. Its been nearly 5 weeks after the travel date, but Etihad is unwilling to initiate a reimbursement. My mistake that I was trying to be nice in making the claim. On tweeting about the reimbursement, Etihad said their records showed baggage delay of only one day. This, when I have mail from Etihad baggage team more than a week after my arrival, trying to plan delivery. Amazing lack of customer centricity. From an airline which gets rated as one of the best!"

We returned to Abu Dhabi on 9th August. We are booked to fly to Lahore on 13th August 2017. This was a family holiday and we were all very excited. We had heard great things about Eitehad and had very high expectations. Unfortunately our experience with Etihad has been just average. The only incredibly positive point was the immigration at Abu Dhabi Airport which saves the hassle of long waits at JFK after a long flight.  The flights on the 20th of June had a staff which was curt and not at all interested in going the extra mile. The staff on the 8th August flight was much warmer. But we had another disappointing experience when an elderly lady who was traveling alone, felt unwell and was weeping with extreme cold and discomfort we reported it to a female stewardess. She gave her hot tea and told her, rather firmly not to weep. My husband asked a fellow lady passenger to put on some socks on her and comforted her. The lady stewardess never returned to check on her even once. This was when 6 hours of the flight were still left. This is not the kind of care and attention one expects from any airline, especially the one which claims to be the best. The food quality and taste was below average on all the flights. The flight to Abu Dhabi on 8th August served a meal which was vegetarian only, had no other option, and the taste was disappointing. They had nothing for the kids other than the kiddie meal, which was the same Pasta both times. There were no extra Chocolates, crisps or cookies available. Kids do tend to get hungry on a 14 hour flight. "

Flew Cochin to Zurich via Abu Dhabi. Hugely disappointing. Had in my head that Etihad would be as good as the other UAE airline. I was wrong. Etihad has a confusing business strategy. They purport to be a premium airline (which perhaps they are in the premium cabins but the best airlines get it right across all products. These were my first flights with Etihad, there was nothing really bad about the flights but there was just nothing really right about them either. Seats on both flights were tight, not very comfortable. Food on the first flight was ok but the food on the second flight was awful. Drinks selection very average. Abu Dhabi airport is at best underwhelming, chaos, perhaps the new terminal will improve things. I don't drink booze flying but had I wanted to I didn't see any on offer. Service was lacklustre on the 787. The 787 as with everyone that uses this aircraft should have been a chance to really improve customer experience, with Etihad there was nothing dreamy about this dreamliner. I got the flight with miles so at least it didn't cost anything to find out that its not an airline I would choose to fly with again. Very average all round. Oh one good thing the ground staff in Cochin were very helpful."

The legroom was far less than on the B777 we had on the outbound flight, and I also felt the seats to be narrower. Food was very average, with only two meat options offered and not even a piece of cheese. Service was also minimalist, as no one bothered to offer us any drinks outside of meals, on a 7 hours flight.

My wife, myself and our two young children (2 years and 6 months old respectively) flew last night from London to Abu Dhabi. Had our flight left on time we would have had two hours to catch our connecting flight to Male. This didn't happen and our flight left London roughly two hours later than it should have done which put our connecting flight at risk. That said we had made up some time and landed at 8am with our connecting flight was at 8:40am. The warning signs appeared on the flight when the crew were evasive when asked for advice, simply telling us to talk to the Etihad 'transit staff'. After we rushed off the plane we were apprehended by the transit staff who made us sit in a waiting area for ten minutes without offering an explanation. We gave up on this and ran to our gate, arriving at 8:25 only to be told we needed to have been there five minutes prior to this point in order to Board (20 minute limit is imposed). We were carrying exhausted young children and at this point my wife burst into tears. We were then shuttled to another transit area, on foot which took ~30 minutes, half dragging/carrying our poor kids. The line at this location was about an hour and a half long with one staff member dealing with ~60 similar issues by themselves. If you ever need to see how a company treats its most vulnerable, captive passengers this place gave it all away. Most of the women were in tears. At this point our children were close to breaking point but we were fortunate to find a kind Etihad employee walking by who took us to alternative transit area. There we were told we had been re-booked on a 00:55 flight and we would be put up in a £40 a night hotel 37km away. The staff in the transit area were aggressive and refused to discuss the logistics of how we were supposed to get two small children, without buggies/strollers, to this destination. Most importantly they refused to discuss why we would have to wait 15 hours when the airline could not have waited five minutes for us to board. Eventually we were able to relocate to a closer hotel but I write this 7 hours later and we are yet to receive a call telling us where our luggage is. We critically need this because our 6mo old son needs milk, nappies and a change of clothes. Taking him outside in 45c heat to try and find the above is not really acceptable. My final gripe, and I appreciate this is a high quality problem, is that we have now missed a night in a hotel we spent a year planning and saving up to visit. Etihad refuse to discuss compensation and their website doesn't offer any advice. I also believe we are entitled to EU flight delay compensation but they're attempting to use the loophole that since we were changing flights outside of the EU this doesn't hold! Please take care when flying in economy with this airline. Their regard for passengers below business/first class is appalling as is their indifference to the conditions young children travel in. "

If I knew or it was clearly stated, I would have bought two legs separately because there is no concession if ticket is bought with return.

I got to Jeddah airport 3 hours before the flight and was able to easily get through the check in and immigration procedures and was on the plane by about 4.15pm with the flight due to depart st 5pm. Unfortunately the flight did not depart at 5pm due to Etihad deciding to wait for passengers and eventually departed over an hour later at about 6.15pm. We were due to arrive in Abu Dhabi at 8.40pm and my connecting flight to Melbourne was at 10.10pm. I anxiously hoped we would pick up speed and get there on time but we arrived at about 9.30pm instead. I desperately needed to make my connecting flight so I checked the gate number on the screen before we arrived and it was gate 61 which was in Terminal 3 and we were arriving in terminal 1. As soon we disembarked I ran as fast as I could to gate 61 and made it to the gate and through security while others were still boarding. As I was about to get on the flight the Etihad personnel said that I was rebooked and could not board the flight. I explained that I had run from my previous flight and there was still 25 minutes till the schedule departure and that I should be allowed to get on this flight. While we were debating several other people who came after me were allowed on the flight which I thought was just wrong. They eventually sent me to the transfer desk who arranged a hotel and meal voucher for me. I was expected to sleep in my already sweaty clothes and come back in the same clothes with no compensation or allowance for some temporary clothes. I asked them to allocate me the same exit row window seat that I had on my original flight and they were not willing to do that. They did not even arrange for me to have my special meal on my rebooked flight. I eventually ended up at the hotel which required me to pass immigration and leave the airport and then after about a 20 minute drive get to a hotel. There is a Transit hotel in the airport which would not require you to leave the transit area or the airport and clearly to save money they booked me into a Holiday Inn outside of the airport. I then about the meal voucher and it was limited to 50AED. That amount would only pay for a sandwich but not even a soft drink which is again ridiculously cheap. I then had to be ready for pickup at 8am in the morning for my flight at 10.45am. I was taken to the airport and as my bags were checked in I was sitting at the gate over 2 hours before the flight which was completely unnecessary as I had to rush out of the hotel and didn't have a chance to shower before I left and now I was stuck waiting at the gate. If they has just booked me into the transit hotel in the airport I would not have this situation. I asked if I could use the lounge to pass some time and was refused. I then realised that all of this hype about Etihad being the world's best customer service airline was a big scam. I would advise anyone who expects good customer service to stay away from Etihad."

Even though I had to go to another desk to pay cash for my excess baggage, I was through to my gate in 20 minutes! On the plane, I was asked if I could move to a seat behind so a mother and child could sit together which was fine. The food was good, I had mac and cheese although I did not like the bean and peas vegetable mix and would have preferred a salad. For entertainment there was a good variety of Hollywood, European, Indian, and some Asian cinema as well as TV shows. I would quite like to see more Asian movies as there were only around three. Seat-wise, I had enough legroom in a normal seat as did the gentleman seated next to me. After a while, I got a little sore but who doesn't when they are seated for hours on end? The staff were attentive and professional, even when there were pesky passengers rushing down the aisle to the doors literally as soon as the plane had landed and had to be repeatedly told to go back to their seats. All in all, a great flight."

Starting from check in, asking us to repack because of one extra kg in one of my bags. On board, the crew is unproffessional. At first they gave my 6 yrs old son a pack of games and coloring booklets and ignored his 8 year old sister sitting next to him. For meals, they only had veggie meals. They said the beef and chicken meals they had are much fewer than veggie and they ran out of it very early! I had two veggie meals in the 14 hours trip. After finishing my meals I waited for about 30 minutes for someone to collect the trash. Overall, highly overrated, unfriendly crew. "

Boeing 777 was a tired old cabin with very cramped uncomfortable seating and my knee kept knocking against the tray table support. Food was below standard and the IFE was pretty awful with very limited choice, hardly many up to date films available unlike Qatar Airways. Although the seat transformed into a flat bed it was so narrow you had no space to turn over and the blanket just kept getting dropped into the aisle way of the plane. Crew were good which was a saving grace, but this plane on a major long haul flight of 13hrs+ desperately needs the new model of business class and a more spacious seat when it comes to sleeping. The A320 from Abu Dhabi to Dammam was a more modern aircraft and pleasant to seat even if it was designed for short haul. Bothe flights left on time and arrived early so hope Eithad continue with on time schedules."

Flew Abu Dhabi to Brisbane. Good: Business class suite in dreamliner was extremely comfortable for a long-haul flight. Great lie-flat bed, comfortable pillow and blanket and bed made up by cabin crew, comfy pyjamas supplied, lots of space to put your stuff, nice toiletries provided. I slept well for about 7 hours. Food was excellent, as was the service. The cabin crew were extremely attentive and helpful. Bathroom for business class was not as cramped as economy, with hand lotion and face spray on offer. Questionable: The entertainment on offer fell far short of virtually any other airline I have flown - there were very few quality movies or TV shows to watch. A bit disappointing for such a large airline. The lighting and different buttons for everything needed quite a bit of explanation. Outgoing flight delayed so my baggage missed the connecting flight in Brisbane."

The return flight was delayed due to technical issues but overall the flights were comfortable given I was in economy class. My gripe was with the appalling standard of the food. I've flown Etihad many times over the years and at one time the food and in-flight service was very good in my opinion. That's all changed. The fodder they dish out now (in mean portions) is dreadful. In years gone by you received a little menu describing the meal choices available. That has been replaced by the cabin attendant shouting, ""chicken, beef or pasta?"" over the noise of the engines. Many people would argue that if you want decent cuisine you should fly business not economy. Perhaps but the food in economy was unacceptable. Next time I will choose another airline."

Generally excellent albeit I was avoiding the horror that is a transfer at Abu Dhabi airport. Check in was slow with only two desks open for economy passengers, a long queue ensuing. Push back was precisely on time, as it generally is at Perth - which must be among the best performing airports in the world on this measure, with a 30 minute early arrival in Abu Dhabi on an airbridge - a rarity. With the flight less than half full plenty of space to stretch out. Notwithstanding, leg room on this newish plane was ample, far better than Qatar for example, the seat comfortable enough. Excellent IFE selection - I passed the time watching the men's semi finals at the French tennis open live from Roland Garos / BBC news reporting on the election - with large high quality screens though these were not without issues namely light and distraction, I question whether it is appropriate for films with extreme violence such as The Revenant to be made available on IFE, especially when you have no choice to switch off. Crew attentive throughout with regular water runs but no recognition of my Gold status. The two special meals supplied - vegetable curries - were tasty if a little basic, no sweet. Extra plus point, however: I was provided with my choice of drink with the meal, a matter invariably 'forgotten' by crew on previous flights. Wifi was available but not used. Bags delivered within 15 minutes of leaving aircraft. In the taxi on my way home 25 minutes after the wheels touched down."

I am extremely disappointed in this airline I have had numerous problems occur within one trip with them. Firstly they overbooked my flight by 4 people and I was one of the people who had to go on a different flight, I was unhappy so they gave me a $300 Etihad transport voucher to compensate. That was fine however when I landed in my destination my luggage had been mishandled by Etihad in a transit through Brisbane. I didn't get my luggage until 2 days after I had landed. When my luggage arrived to my house the handle on my suitcase had completely broken off and it was fine beforehand. I tried to at least earn miles from this awful experience. I joined the Etihad guest membership online and followed the instructions to claim miles with them through email. I sent an email to them 3 days ago still no reply other than an automated message saying ""we have received your email we will reply asap"". So I wasn't able to claim miles for my flight. I wanted to use the voucher given to me worth $300. I often fly to the UAE so I found a flight to Abu Dhabi partly operated by Etihad airways via Hong Kong from New Zealand. I called them to confirm I could use my voucher on a flight which is partly operated by Etihad and I was told I could but I have to call them directly to make a booking. I called again to make a booking and was told I couldn't use my voucher on a flight partly operated by them. I can't use my voucher on any flight operated just by them because they don't fly in or out of New Zealand which is where I live. I'm very angry at this company and their unprofessional staff."

Going out I would have said it was one of the best airlines I had flown with but changed my mind on the return flight with the abysmal treatment I was given by a belligerent staff member at check in at Manchester airport. One of the reasons for picking the airline was that I had a 30kg allowance and on fronting up to the desk my bag weighed 29kg. The staff member said it was too heavy and when I explained I had the 30kg allowance she would not accept this and told me to empty some into the rubbish and queue up again. I did this and 2 1/4 hours later I was at her desk again. My bag now weighed 26kg and she said I had to pay 94 pounds and could have 32kg. Not only had I run out of time to retrieve my goods from the rubbish I then had to pay this amount and carry on. I was appalled at the treatment and really disillusioned by the whole process and would be reluctant to fly with this airline again! My hand luggage complied with the rules.

Check in was smooth, baggage arrived intact, connection was a breeze, and the US pre-clearance meant that exit at JFK was easy.

The screen in front of me was a low resolution and small screen. After an hour, they served curry chicken meal. It was quite awkward to have lunch at breakfast time. At landing at Abu Dhabi, the plane did not stop at any gate bridges. The passengers were transported in busses. I saw a lot of gate bridges empty but I don't know why they did so.

To my surprise, she told me that she couldn't do anything with a big smile on her face. I had to rotate back and shout at their Mum. The kids stopped for a while but then they started to kick my chair during the whole flight. I convinced myself to watch a movie in that bad screen to watch a movie to forget about that kid. Every 10 mins, the movie stopped automatically and switched back to the main menu. The passenger beside me had the same thing with his tiny screen. The second leg was an annoying flight.

When I inquired with one of the flight attendants why the change of equipment he insulted my intelligence by saying the outbound service is on a Boeing 787-9 and the return is on an A330-200 which is impossible as the same aircraft that leaves has to return. The seats on the A330-200 are better than the 787 but the entertainment system is outdated and the toilets are tiny and have an annoying angled wall that makes standing awkward! The service was very good but the steak I had for dinner was badly done and had strange smell to it just before arriving I had a cereal . Arriving in Abu Dhabi was slightly delayed and we had to use the staircase which is always annoying , the connecting flight to Doha was also delayed and for a strange reason the pilot took us for a rather long taxi which seemed more like a tour of Abu Dhabi Airport, actually it felt longer than the short flight to Doha, but the service was also very good and the arrival in Doha was smooth.

I had booked a return journey 8 months prior to the trip. Before the trip I had received 3 emails about my return flight stating that my flight has been rescheduled, but the difference was 10 minutes only. (ie. my 10 pm flight was rescheduled to 9.50 pm). I had booked the meal and everything was fine. On the day of the travel, me and my wife boarded a below par airplane from Hyderabad to Abu Dhabi. The charger point was not working, the food was served 2 hours afted the departure with no refreshments. Even after pressing the call button to get the flight attendent's attention i did not get any response. The food was not great and nothing except the dinner was served. My next flight from Abu dhabi to Paris was slightly better but again food served was mediocre. The main story started in the return leg. As mentioned, i was suppose to travel back at 9.50 PM from paris. when i arrived to drop my bag, I found that my flight had already departed at 10 am that morning. I was told that the same was informed to me via email. Luckily i had not deleted any mail from etihad and i was able to show them that the flight change was for 10 min not 12 hours! I was scared as this was the first time such thing happened to me. They told me to talk to the reservation website. Luckily i had booked the flight from etihad website itself and therefore I was able to push them to call their reservation desk. The manager came to me and started talking to the reservation office. It was realised than an email was dropped to me 20 days before the travel date with the mentioned changes. I was able to find the email but it just provide the receipt of payment with no mention of details of change in time. Etihad was not able to explain the reason and as there were seats available they were able to book us on the same flight after a lot of argument. Even though it was the airline that was at fault the manager had the audacity to tell me that I should be more careful next time. Then one more issue presented itself. The flight I booked had 2 hours of waiting time in Abu Dhabi. For the flight that etihad gave me later I had to wait 8 hours at Abu Dhabi airport. I was so frustrated and tired that I did not argue and just wished that i reach my home. Again the food and service in the return flights were mediocre. "

The crew were great, the aircraft getting a little tired. The big size PJs were back in stock and the service left on time. I'm a big guy, the business class seats are only just big enough for me. The table is a bit tight on my guts so I lean the chair back. Qatar Airways tables have more room, I have no issues with them. Etihad remain my first choice but seem to be losing ground with tired aircraft interiors in the older fleet. I wish I could get some sort of wifi frequent flyer before I fly - I'm always scared to buy on board."

The gate was pretty full, but the airport staff handled the situation very well. I pre selected our seats for free, we had the last seats in the first economy segment. There is no restricted recline, which is very nice, because you do not bother anyone by reclining your seat. The staff was attentive and the food delicious for economy and the IFE was good. They offer a solid economy experience. I would fly them again, but I still prefer Qatar Airways and Emirates."

The 3am run to Doha uses an old aircraft crammed with workers in transit. Business class is not much different to economy, and it's often full of people who have been pumped up. This is a hardline, workers transit flight. If your flying business don't be fooled, nothing fancy on this leg. The good news is if it's part of a longer haul flight the other leg will likely have been awesome - Etihad awesome, which is fantastic."

A recent family trip to Frankfurt gave me the chance to travel with Etihad Airways and I had high expectations in terms of their service. Unfortunately, the experience was an unforgettably horrible one. As I was boarding the gate in Manila, Etihad’s ground staff informed me that my seat did not recline and had no light or power. To add insult to injury, the seat area had a pungent odor. Since this was a family trip with a connecting flight and nobody could offer me a workable solution, I had to have the seat manually adjusted to a flat recline and endure a 9-hour flight without lights or power. To cap it off, the stewardess directed me to go to the toilet at the back end of business class when I went to the business class toilet near the cockpit, as if I was bothering them. To make up for my discomfort, I was handed a letter saying that they have given me free miles equivalent to a polo shirt from their souvenir store. As a frequent flyer, I found this an unjust compensation for the level of distress I experienced on such a long flight, so I decided to return the letter and reject the offer. I then proceeded to email a formal complaint to their customer service only to receive the same proposal despite my objections the first time. I decided to raise my concern to their CEO and was surprised and disappointed to get the same reply from a customer service agent who continued to insist on their offer. I just want to share how let down I felt as a customer of an airline as purportedly reputable as Etihad Airways."

Where their competitors serve a full tray with tea or coffee and other one with warm sandwich, cupcakes and juice. No drinks were offered and they disappeared after serving this ""meal"". Second flight out of Abu Dhabi to Kozhikode was light load and early morning departure crew were very attentive and smiling throughout which I was very much surprised to see. Especially the supervisor everytime she pass by the cabin, was found smiling to the passengers. May be because the flight was not full and they were not under stress. But the breakfast served was complete bland with only two choices, pre packed cold croissant was offered and portion size was very small. Overall still surprised by the fact attitude of the crew has been changed in both sectors. A good note to the airline"

They told me that my luggage was still in Berlin as it had not made it onto the plane.  Again, they said they would keep me informed and let me know the status of my luggage. After hearing nothing from them the following day (3rd day) and having to call in again, I was finally told my luggage was in Melbourne.  After countless calls to customer services and email correspondences between Etihad, a month later, I finally received my money back. On my way back to Budapest from Melbourne, I was told to pick up my boarding pass from Etihad services in Abu Dhabi for my next lay over in Rome. I was shooed away by Etihad staff and told I would receive my boarding pass in Rome. When landing in Rome, I was not allowed through security as I had no boarding pass and no one at Etihad services would help me. I finally made it through after a struggle with security. "

Got special assistance to get through passport and security-checks. Very friendly staff. Welcome on board was warm and efficient, the food and beverage manager even remembered me from an earlier flight. My seat was changed from window to a center-seat without even informing me. Seat (business-class) very narrow and under par from key competitors with a 50/50% divide of seat and a 'side-table' (where the guest behind puts his feet for sleeping). No head-rest cover (unhygienic). No amenity kit any more for a long haul overnight flight (staff informed me that they discontinued offering them). Eat-when-you-like option is nice but dinner is served on a tray like in economy-class. Flight crew were efficient and friendly throughout the flight. Bad sleep because of no eye-shades offered. Flight arrived on time so easy to make my connection to Frankfurt. Etihad lounge in AUH overcrowded, hard to find a seat. Service on my continuing flight from AUH to FRA was excellent again. My lunch-choice was not available, yet they managed to get it for me. Again no amenity-kits. One of the bathrooms was wet and dirty, so better to keep your shoes on (I didn't) because of lack of slippers. Couldn't sleep because of day-flight and no eye-shades offered. Could not freshen up before landing because no razor-set or even a tooth-brush offered. Arrived Frankfurt on time. My verdict: while service at Etihad is still excellent the seats in business-class are small and uncomfortable because of bad design and the airline seems to cut costs by lowering its standards in business-class."

I had some expectations which have't been completely fulfilled. Well this is how life is, you can't have it all even from a 5* airline (for first class cabin, though). Flying economy didn't seem like a 5* airline at all. And the seats were incredibly uncomfortable, and in the Boeing 787-9 the configuration is bad. You don't really feel it until it is completely full, like the last haul when coming back (night flight) from Abu Dhabi to Dusseldorf. When 3 people are sitting next to each other, no matter how big or small it is almost impossible to sleep. Another bad thing for me was that the entertainment system closes 45 minutes before landing (really?) and it is available only after take off after the proper altitude has been reached. You just have to do something else 45 minutes before landing. The screen were big enough and the variety of programs was good. As a platinum Etihad Airways frequent flyer I was allowed to use the very nice first class lounge in Abu Dhabi. An inconvenience happened in Hong Kong, when travelling with my girlfriend and being on the same reservation together, it was just me who got an invitation to join the departure lounge of Hong Kong Airlines. This I found really impolite and if this means customer satisfaction by cutting costs, then they are cutting in the wrong place. We refused to use the lounge and went for a drink at one of the cafes in the airport. The food onboard was probably not a lot but the quality of the products was the best in economy I had so far. I have prebooked a vegetarian meal and they were pretty nice and paid attention to these details. The best from all the flights was that they were ahead of schedule in all the flights (sometimes 30-40 minutes) and this means they are interested in getting you to your destination in time, which is a big plus. As an overall rating I would give them 3* for economy, this is where they are, according to my personal view."

We first flew from Dublin to Abu Dhabi using Etihad and thought that the poor service could have been a fluke but we were wrong. On our direct flight home from Abu Dhabi to Toronto the service continued to go downhill. The flight attendants were rude and not helpful. It took over an hour for someone to come to us when we turned on our attendant light. Attendants would see the light and walk right past us. Passengers around us also had this problem and we heard chatter about how the staff was rude and they had received better service on other airlines. The food was not good either. I understand that plane food usually isn't great but after following Etihad on Instagram and reading other things online I expect better, especially on such a long flight. I have had better food and service on one hour flights with other airlines. Also, there is a lack of organization at the airport for this airline. Getting through the gate was a logistical nightmare and the Etihad staff did not communicate effectively with patrons. Everyone was everywhere and did not know what was going on. All in all, poor customer service and poor organization led to a very negative experience flying with Etihad."

The so-called breakfast was a soggy little meat pie soaking in potato mash. On the bright side the cabin staff were cheery and did as much as they could with what they had to work with. The second leg of this journey from Abu Dhabi to Milan was with Alitalia and the staff, comfort and catering were excellent in every way. Next time Alitalia all the way or Qatar.

Inconsistent product, the first leg was 9 out of 10, apart from check in being slow and some uninteresting food on board a very obliging and caring crew who looked after the cabin perfectly. Check in was one of those times when 2.5 hours ahead of the flight joining the economy queue would have got you to a check in agent faster than being in the Business queue. Redirected to another agent after about 15 minutes, the delay at the Business Class counter being a complicated upgrade. The lounge at EDI is really poor, you are better going shopping. However on the plane, despite the older cabin, for the most part it was what flying should be where you felt spoilt. Lounge at AUH was quiet and the food was OK, lots of variety and a good bar service. On board the 787 the service to BNE was much poorer, while the crew were pleasant they weren't proactive. No water offered at night, had to ask for salt and pepper and a glass of wine with the meal. The second meal was not offered and had to be requested close to arrival. The food on this flight was of a much lower standard and was overcooked both times and cold the second time. If you asked for two things (e.g. jam and cutlery), the crew member came back with only one of them stating that it was a long flight and they were tired, knowing they had forgotten something. Except for a refresh of bubbly before landing you had to request everything. Tone however was very pleasant and apologetic tone. Wine was really great on both flights and on the second flight I decided to sleep in any case given my fatigue and the lack of attention being paid to passengers. Bags off really fast. Limo at both ends is a wonderful service. Sadly the expectations from the first flight were so high and the second flight was a let down as more of a 4 out of 10."

The 787 cabin is much nicer that the others in the Etihad fleet that I have travelled on apart from the bed is harder that the older A330. In every other aspect the 787 is a superior product and the high quality of the experience really ramped up once onboard with a wonderful and obliging crew. The food on the first 787 sector was superb, the beef fillet was perfect and the meal service top notch. Wine on both flights were exceptional. The second flight had a less warm and competent crew and the food for the main meal was overcooked and half of it not edible. It was still a pretty comfortable flight overall with the majority of time spent sleeping. Bags were off really quickly and with the free chauffeur waiting we were at our hotel less than an hour after the plane touched down.

I prefer the Business class seats of the Boeing 777-300 as opposed to the ones in the A330s as they are a little wider and provide more comfort when sleeping."

Connie Tang",,25th March 2017,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Perth via Abu Dhabi,March 2017,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,,1,no,1,"  London to Perth via Abu Dhabi. Etihad was disappointing for such a large airline with a great reputation. I had expected them to be amazing but have had quite a negative and frustrating experience with them especially when I had an issue with them. Overall experience with the ground staff were that they were nice but didn't go above and beyond to make me feel like a special guest. Cabin staff service was average. While the staff were nice, they seemed only do the bare-minimum. They were slow with my requests and at one point, forgot my request for tea, which after 30 minutes of waiting I had to get up and get my own tea. The airplane was nice and the seats were quite comfortable but the blankets and pillows were mediocre. The blankets were quite thin and flimsy, where I had to have two to feel warm. The meals were served quite often though but they were quite bland and I was generally not impressed with the taste or variety of the meals. While the above experience was not great, what made it worse was my experience with the customer service staff regarding my luggage and I would like to warn people the policies regarding checked-in luggage. I had checked in my luggage (after paying an excess baggage fee of £97.50 for being over the limit, which I accepted) and had expected my luggage to arrive at my destination in the same condition. However, when I received the luggage the handle did not come out anymore and was clearly damaged during the transfer from London to Perth. When I approached the ground staff, they advised me to contact their online customer service regarding the matter but there was nothing they could do at that point. I did contact their Baggage Claim customer service department and received a generic response telling me that their policies state 'they are not responsible for damage to luggage due to wear and tear or damage to handles and wheels' so they asked for my 'kind understanding' to accept that policy but they would gladly write a note to my travel insurer so I could claim through them. I was not pleased with this response because I would be out of pocket again to claim through my insurer and asked to be referred to someone that would be able to deal with me as a person and not reiterate their policies. The response I received was quite antagonising and frustrating, they said they couldn't do anything because 'they couldn't confirm the cause of the alleged damage' and they referred me to another department which after 3 days still have not responded to my query. This ordeal has been over a week and I have been pushed around to different departments and ignored and left with no satisfactory response to my situation. I'm quite disappointed with Etihad's response (or lack of) since other airlines would have quickly resolved this issue without making the customer go around in circles. Etihad has a good reputation but be warned that they do not treat their customers with respect and listen to their situation when things go wrong. They are generally quite unhelpful and will provide generic responses or pull policies on you. For such a big company, I expected some flexibility especially if an irate customer has approached them several times to give them the opportunity to rectify the situation. I would not recommend Etihad, there are other airlines that can provide much more superior service for the same or cheaper price."

Very poor economy product overall that was destroyed by the new Etihad 'smart seat'. This seat may be smart for reducing costs for the airline but it is like sitting on a wooden bench. Having recently flown Qatar Airways I would say the Etihad economy product is far behind. This seat is totally not suitable for a 14 hour flight and I would challenge the airline CEO to sit in this seat for a long-haul flight to see that it is not fit for purpose. Staff seemed like robots only doing the minimum required. Overall the A380 Etihad economy product is below par and at the bottom end of the market. Would rather use other carriers in the future.

The staff at check-in and on the flight were all excellent, but the actual aircraft for both legs of my journey felt incredibly small and tight. I am a tall man (190cms), but the 787-9 was especially small and a struggle to fit my legs into the space provided. When the seat is reclined, the bottom part moves forward which gives me even less room. If the seat in front is reclined, it is very difficult to eat food from my seat tray. This has its advantages as the food is probably the worst I have experienced on a flight. If all the other airlines can provide edible food, there is no excuse for Etihad, especially as it constantly touts itself as a premium airline. I got the very distinct impression that they really do not give 2 thoughts towards economy passengers and its all about the bigger margins in business and 1st class. The Business Manager for Etihad could do themselves a favour by travelling with Emirates in economy and see what can be done for the same price. The 2 airlines are not even close in comparison."

For some reason, this is always the case with Etihad-not sure if they are short staffed, have antiquated systems, or just simply do not care about the 95% of passengers who fly economy (of course, there were copious staff for business/first checkin who were doing nothing). Flight was on a new Dreamliner-seats were much tighter than other Dreamliners I've flown with other airlines, but not terrible. Great entertainment system.

Abu Dhabi airport was nowhere near as bad as previous reviews. Yes it was busy but then what airport is quiet at 06:00? Security check was no more than 25 minutes in a cattle line. I found the economy seat on the A330 very hard and uncomfortable. The IFE was as good as Emirates, crew were multinational and friendly. The breakfast snack was a joke and they are very stingy when it comes to drinks - all drinks, including water, are served in plastic cups. Crew were nowhere to be seen, except chatting at the back, after the meal was served - to few juice and water rounds. I booked the transit hotel (airside) in Abu Dhabi as our connecting time was 8 hours - well worth the $149 for the room for six hours and an hour in the lounge.

Manchester ground staff were lovely and are not included in this review. Firstly we booked tickets and due to circumstances we wanted to change the name on one of the tickets. Even though myself and my husband paid for these tickets apparently we don't own them, they belong to the person whose name is on the ticket. So now a person who didn't fly or pay for the ticket no owns a free ticket to use for themselves!? No money can ever be returned. We had an accident at the airport which meant that we couldn't fly on our original flight. And we were assured by Etihad Airways management that we would be put on the next possible flight with minimal costs to us. £20-30 max, however the truth is it cost us an additional £1900! Why when the accident which required my 2yr old to be rushed to hospital from the departure lounge! Assurances and results seem to be very different from management at the ground to the sellers on the phone at the head office. On the new flights it seemed completely unorganised and irresponsible that Etihad Airways thought it was perfectly fine for my 2yr old daughter to be sat on her own without myself or my mother who was attending the flight just to help with the children. The ground staff in Manchester worked tirelessly making sure that this was corrected before we boarded. However it seems that Abu Dhabi staff are less interested and treated me with disrespect and disgust. I stood at the gate for over an hour trying to sort out the mistake they had made to be told by their manager that I can either board the flight and have my 2 yr old sat alone or I can stay in Abu Dhabi, my choice. I was also traveling with my 1 yr old son who I bought a seat for as the flight was too long for him to not have his own space. Now I as told that passengers with infants get priority seating i.e. The space and the options of bassinets for baby's which was one of the reasons for booking with Etihad. However I was not given this either other parents were but I wasn't. I boarded the flight to be told on board that my daughter could sit alone and my mother alone elsewhere on the flight and myself to sit with my son on my lap. Without the seat I had paid for him! And this to the staff was completely acceptable and because I was getting increasingly distressed at the prospect of my 1 yr old without his seat or a bassinet and my 2 yr old sat alone for a 14hr flight, they dealt with it by stating my son doesn't have his own seat and that if I didn't calm down I would be escorted off the flight! The air staff took my 4 boarding passes from me and never returned them. An Australian member of ground staff, who treated me very disrespectfully told me as I had no proof of my 4 boarding passes lost by the staff I had no right to the additional seat for my son. If it wasn't for a couple giving up their seats for me and my children I don't think I would have ever taken that flight. We took off with my son without his seat and my daughter sat beside me and with me in an attempt to try and hold down a 1yr old and 2 yr old myself. All in all my family and I paid up to £6k for these flights which I have to say was possibly the worst 32 hours of my life because Etihad Airways have no respect or helpful approach to traveling families in Abu Dhabi. They were awful to deal with and deny that they made mistakes like sitting a 2 yr old on her own! Or giving me a seat which I paid for. Terrible service and never fly with them if you can help it."

I went to the Maldives with my wife. Since this was booked as a package holiday it unfortunately only included economy seats. So we asked the check in agent in Munich for a paid upgrade, which we were granted. I paid the approximately 700 Euro (for one of the four segments) by credit card and was handed over the business class tickets. We went off to do some last minute shopping at Munich airport when about 10 minutes later an public announcement (probably airport-wide, since we were already in the central area) was made that asked us to return to the checkin counter. At the counter we were told by the Etihad ""Guest Services Agent"" in charge that ""unfortunately"" our initial tickets were not upgradable and we cannot not keep them (not even by paying more etc.). No choice, no regret, no sorry. While I do understand that there are corporate policies regarding ticket upgrades, the described behaviour (of recalling already issued boarding cards) is unacceptable. It doesn't even make sense from a corporate standpoint since the seats remained empty for the flight. Furthermore our initially reserved economy seats were given to somebody else in the meantime. That also meant that we didn't even receive our pre-ordered special meals. According to the cabin crew member somebody else got it instead. I complained to Etihad about this but got nothing but a dull and worthless standard letter. By no means was this middle eastern hospitality or ""five star"" service. Two lessons I learned from this experience: Book business class right away and avoid Etihad Airways (not only for the experience described above but also for the horrible and dirty airport in Abu Dhabi which would be another story for itself)."

After flying with this airline in the past both business and economy I vowed never to fly them again. However, as I was looking for a cheap flight back to Thailand after a trip to the UK for a family bereavement I went for the cheapest one-way and they were the cheapest at the time of looking. In Manchester, at the check-in which was in itself an ordeal, I arrived 3.5 hours before departure only to be in a huge queue that stretched back around coffee machines and public toilets due to lack of space. This was because only 3 check in desks were supplied for economy, the rest were for online check in. In other words, don't check in online and you will be treated to being tended to last and at the back of the queue. I wouldn't have minded but those who took a chance and went to the online check in were still seen to despite not having checked in online, which resulted in chaos for the rest of us who tried to go by the rules. Then, I had to put my hand luggage into this metal cage to check for size. My hand case was 3kg under the 7kg allowance, but wouldn't go in this metal cage lengthways as it was 2cm too long. They then informed me that to take my hand case onboard, I would be required to cough up GBP155. Due to my wife's quick thinking, as the case wasn't new, we discarded it and put the contents into plastic bags. With reluctance, they agreed this was ok so I lost my case yet didn't give them the satisfaction of stripping me of GBP155. After trying to recover from the stressful check-in, once on the aircraft, we had to sit for 1.5 hours due to the usual delays. Then, chaos ensued at Abu Dhabi transit. Hundreds of people fighting to get through with no organization and a gate area so small that everyone was queuing for what seemed like miles outside the gate area.  To be fair, the crew on both legs were attentive and very good and no complaints with regard to them. Etihad are a disgrace and I won't be flying with them again!"

I seek a help of one of the airport guys saying that I need help to reach the gate quickly to which he asks someone to help only to find that guy is busy over speaking on his mobile. Seeing that, the airline staff guides us to go through a lane that could clear the security fast and it was such a haste and hurry in the process forgot to pick up a few things that were put to security check.

Self and my wife booked our tickets 3 months in advance. The airline refuses to pick a seat unless you pay for it, so we allowed the airlines to allocate the seat. We were on a Boeing 777 (Toronto to Abu Dhabi) and quite shocked to see we were right on the tail even though we booked the tickets 3 months in advance. The seat was very narrow and extremely uncomfortable added to that the seat I was sitting was defective - would not move, so I had to travel 12.5 hours in upright position. Added to that, the entertainment unit was flickering non-stop so I could not use the unit as well. The airline requested us to update our profile so that they know our preferences in advance. However, it looks like a gimmick. The menu card was provided on one side but not to us. When the crew came to serve us, they said all that they have was vegetarian and we accepted but the quality was just horrible. Overall, it was horrible experience. Our flight from Abu Dhabi to Mumbai was on A340, the seat was better but service was a stinker. Again, we were seated right at the tail end and they could only serve us vegetarian! On the way back we were on A380 on BOM-AUH. Great experience, the seats were good but again, we were on seats 85E/F - the tail end. They could only serve us Vegetarian but this time we refused to eat. We asked for a glass of water and my wife took a glass of Sprite.

I did manage to get some red wine (served in plastic cup direct from big bottle). I am not impressed and will not seek them out in the future. Also, entertainment system was poor: buggy, bad reaction to pressing, poor selection, fuzzy screen."

Carry-on luggage was being checked for size. Many cabin luggages not passing for being too long for Etihad Airways cabin bag allowance. The bag shop at the gate was packed with Etihad passengers. I too bought a new bag in order to board the flight. So, if you think you are a traveller who never had issues with your American Tourister or other cabin-sized bag, be ready for a surprise."

Flew Manchester to Ho Chi Minh via Abu Dhabi. Arrived at Abu Dhabi to be told we had been moved onto a flight 24 hours later, this despite people still boarding the flight we were booked on. Got told to go to the transfer desk, who informed us we would be sent to Bangkok instead and then be given a transfer from there. As we were in time for our original flight I asked to speak to a manager to which I was told that no managers or supervisors work at Abu Dhabi airport. I checked this several times and the woman was insistent this was the case and we had to get on the flight to Bangkok otherwise we would have to stay in the airport for 24 hours. Reluctantly we agreed. The flight to Bangkok was awful. The inflight entertainment system wasn't working. We got given breakfast and then left with the trays for over an hour before they bothered to clear them away. The first drinks were served 4 hours into the flight. At Bangkok we were then put on a Vietnam Airlines flight to Ho Chi Minh. Upon arrival, 3 hours after we should have arrived, we found our bags had been left in Abu Dhabi. Everybody from Etihad had left for the night. We were left without our luggage for over 24 hours. Just the winter clothes we travelled in (not pleasant in 30+degrees). Etihad refused to reimburse us for any essential clothes and toiletries we had to buy as a result. Took over 4 weeks to respond to a complaint. As we got no response we posted our complaint on their Facebook page. After we did so we then found our return seats had been moved from being sat together to being sat apart. I can only advise others to avoid this airline. "

I could not fault Etihad Airways in anyway on our flight from London Heathrow to Melbourne via Abu Dhabi. We had superb service at check in in London. The staff solved the problem of my husband not having a visa for Australia with aplomb and speed. We were happy to be informed in advance that our flight was delayed for 3 hours which meant we could leave our home in a leisurely fashion. The Business Class lounges in London and Abu Dhabi were spotless and the spa area in both, were a great place to get a most excellent massage. We were delighted to be upgraded to First Class on the long flight from Abu Dhabi to Melbourne. The service was First Class and the food delicious. Thank you to all those people who made our trip unforgettable

Did not make the connection in Abu Dhabi because of a minor 30-minute delay departing from Kolkata, and the pre-clearance was already closed for the second leg from Abu Dhabi to San Francisco. The pre-clearance in Abu Dhabi is Etihad's main selling point however, it's actually a huge pain and causes lots of passengers to miss their connecting flights. Etihad automatically rebooked me on a later flight to LAX, then LAX to SFO with American Airlines, adding 10 hours to my original trip. All they did was take my boarding pass to SFO and give me the new boarding passes to SFO via LAX without any explanation. No lounge access or hotel was offered to me. No one was able to tell me if my luggage would follow me, which was really frustrating. Got a middle seat for the Abu Dhabi-Los Angeles which lasted 17 hours. Also, cherry on the cake, the LAX-SFO was cancelled due to ""air traffic"" and no one told me, so I ended up flying United back home, arriving 13 hours later than originally planned. Finally, my luggage did follow me - surprisingly after so many obstacles. Anyway, easily the worst trip I've ever had. Not flying Etihad ever again, the onboard experience was a 3/5 but the ground experience 1/5. More importantly, just stay away from any pre-clearance in Abu Dhabi, you're likely to miss your connection and waste a huge amount of time as a result."

The apartment is superb. Much more refined than the Emirates suite, and in a different league from Qantas or BA First. The separate seat and bed set-up is excellent, there's a great feeling of spaciousness, and lots of storage. The vanity unit is a nice touch. The whole thing exudes class. Unfortunately I didn't find the bed desperately comfortable. It is extremely hard, even for someone who likes a firm bed. They need to invest in some thicker mattresses to deal with this as a priority. The shower is good, though not close to the quality of the EK bathrooms. Amenity kits were nothing special and didn't include deodorant. When I used my own, the spray set off the smoke detector and I was interrupted when only half-dressed by three crew members rather aggressively demanding to know if I was having a cigarette while showering. The toilet lighting was very dim on all four sectors which was a bit frustrating. The on board chefs were all exceptional in their attitude, and happy to make bespoke dishes (within reason), the F&B managers more varied and I didn't really see the point of them. Other crew were consistently very good indeed. IFE was ok with a pretty good selection of recent and older films. Transfers in AUH were speedy (though not well signposted) but First Class priority at security was not open. The (shared business and First) lounge at LHR was quite small but ok. Spa treatments for First passengers complimentary. AUH lounge not especially spacious either but with spa where I enjoyed an excellent massage and paid a small amount for a traditional shave (which was superb). A la carte breakfast was very good. SYD business and First lounge pleasant but no spa. Very friendly staff. Flights on time and any issues always explained. One big annoyance - at check in in Sydney I spotted that my confirmed seat had been changed to a much less attractive one. The senior customer service representative couldn’t work out why and after several conversations and calls discovered a couple travelling together wanted to be in adjacent seats, but hadn't reserved ahead. They had persuaded somebody senior, who should have known better, to displace me without asking. I was extremely displeased, not least that the change had been made unilaterally, for non-operational reasons. I had it changed back and received an apology from the agent (though not the person responsible), but it left a sour taste. Overall, however, easily now my favourite first class, and I wouldn't hesitate to fly them again."

Definite dip in quality over last few years with Etihad. Movie selection really poor - around 30 English movies only. Food poorer quality than I'm used to on long haul flights, and on an 8.5 hour flight we only had a ""snack"" (inedibly dry cheese roll) then 6 hour gap before breakfast of pasty eggs just before landing. Alcohol service awful. Surly and annoyed looks from cabin crew when we ordered a glass of wine to go with dinner - huge sigh, ""well I'll need to get a piece of paper"", then long wait until after dinner service finished to bring drinks. I understand it's an Arabic airline but surly attitude from crew unnecessary and Emirates etc much better for this. Cabin horrendously cold - everyone around needed extra blankets.

Staff are attentive for me. Lounge at Melbourne Airport is superb. I'm a Virgin Australia platinum flyer so I get to use the first class lounge in AUH which is a bonus. For the Edinburgh flight you need to get a bus to the plane which adds time so not ideal. Food and beverage onboard is good with a broad selection and my first choice has always been available. The one beef I do have (and this has happened to me twice now) is that the concept of priority baggage seems to not be a benefit. Twice my bags have been last off which defeats the purpose of being first off the plane. It's a stated benefit so they should make sure they deliver on it. Not exactly the worst thing but it meant I waited 45 mins for my bags. One other thing, still not been credited with status points and I flew three and a half weeks ago."

AUH lounge in T3 was full and had to wait 10 mins to get a seat. For return flight the lounge in CDG was very good with great service. On board I did not get a welcome drink or hot towel when boarded the CDG-AUH flight despite the flight being slighty delayed by fog. Flight crew where not caring when calling them thru the ""call "" button. Flight was late at AUH and no information where given about transfer. Security check crowded and I had to tell the staff I was a business passenger as there was no dedicated line. For AUH-BKK flight, again, no welcome drink or hot towel. After ringing cabin crew with no answer several times I had to stand up and go ""disturb"" two female cabin crew chatting in the galley to get my welcome drink. The plane config was old with very tiny business class sleeper seats, no space for personal items to put even a newspaper or glasses. The only good thing on this flight was a cabin manager who was very caring and without the good service provided by this person my flight would have been a totally disastrous experience. Thanks god I had this ticket at a discounted price. Will certainly not choose Etihad if i have to pay a full price business class ticket.

Once I showed them the email with my original seat and after a lot of standing my ground they finally gave us seats behind and infront of my child - I still couldn't see him but was at least close to him. On boarding I had to deal with an angry passenger who said I had taken his seat, the cabin crew did not assist in anyway, thankfully once I explained we had lost our seats he calmed down. They couldn't explain why they had given my prebooked seats away. The food on board was awful and half way through the flight they ran out of lots of the food - I don't understand how this could happen when the flight had left from Abu Dhabi which is their home, so if anything it should have been better then the flight that left Heathrow.

A cramped old narrow bodied A320 was deployed on the Cairo-Abu Dhabi sector. I had paid extra for an exit row seat but felt cheated as it only gave me an extra inch or so. Cost cutting was evident as Etihad have cut back on all the touches one would expect from a decent airline. No menu cards, no hot towels or even cold wipes, no blankets, no desert with dinner (only a small low quality chocolate bar). Most of the crew were grumpy, although some passengers did stretch their patience. The 2 cramped toilets at the rear were not in a pleasant state by the end of the flight.

Flight seemed about 50% full in economy. Cabin very clean and tidy with a very comfortable seat. Service and food very good. When I came to my seat at the time of boarding there was a medium sized cake box on the empty adjacent seat which I assumed another pax had left with intentions of returning to their seat. When doors were closed, I mentioned to the cabin crew checking seat belts that the box on the seat next to me did not belong to me. They asked passengers nearby and nobody claimed it as theirs. The box was then placed in an overhead locker near the galley area. I was surprised they did not make a cabin announcement requesting ownership prior to departure. The sector to London was on an A380 and the flight seemed full in economy. Seat was comfortable and cabin very clean. Entertainment system excellent with a wide choice of programs on both flights. The economy food on the AUH-LHR sector was not as good as expected from a 5 star airline. Room for improvement on this front. Disembarking at LHR seemed to take a very long time for pax seated to the rear of the aircraft. I guess this is the peril of flying in such a large capacity aircraft. Both flights were good value for money as I booked 6 weeks in advance. Both flights were on schedule so no real complaints and would definitely fly again with Etihad."

Food wasn't bad, though I wishes I had two full meals on 14hr flight - but it was one full and other was light, with in between ice cream. Seat was comfortable and had good chance to stretch being at the back of the aircraft. FAs were courteous and caring. Inflight entertainment choice wasn't great. For the inflight wifi I paid $20, which otherwise is free on Emirates A380. "

At the check-in they had some problems with a women at the online check in gate, so they took me to the business class check in. Boarding was no problem and it was very quick. I think this flight was only 40% full. One issue - from row 39-40 the inflight tv were not working,  so was advised to sit some rows in front to see it. I had 2 seats for me, so I had no problem to sleep on the 13 hours journey. The tv was later working, but there were no sound. So I watched on my macbook.

I eventually became regular with Etihad and silver class. This time I tried their Business class from Doha to Chennai via Abu Dhabi. I was surprised with the staff attentiveness and availability in business class which was far lower that in economy class staff. During the 4 hrs night flight the cabin became too warm and business class passengers became restless pressing the calling button for help, but in vain - no flight attendants were available for long time. At that point I felt economy class was better than business class for attendees availability and service. On contrary my return flight business class was fantastic. "

I'm a Gold Frequent Flyer member of Etihad and I find this an effective marketing strategy from their end as it encourages me to fly with them more often given the perks (priority boarding, extra luggage allowances and lounge access) even when not flying business class. But the service of the FAs often does not follow the kind of service-oriented profile the airline aims to put forward. I am often tempted to go back to other competing airlines due to this. The FAs projects a feeling of boredom with their jobs and and an obvious lack of passion. In my recent flight for which this review is anchored, service was no more than okay. They followed basic service protocols bu not more than that. It's a culture of service that has to be seriously introduced."

First Class on Etihad Airways was an interesting experience. While the seat and meals were good. I did not appreciate the lacklustre service from the flight attendants. They seemed embattled and soulless. Etihad needs to do a better job to incentivize their staff to encourage them to perform better, keep passengers satisfied and build their frequent flyer base. If not, this will ultimately lead to their demise in a currently challenging market that is seeing even the best airlines making huge losses. The dismal service is ironically more apparent on business class and first class flights rather than economy class. Aside from the service, the range of beverages have taken a drastic turn for the worse, with Johnny Walker being left out of the menu and San Pellegrino sparkling water being swapped with a local cheaper brand 'Al Ain' water as part of an obvious budget cut (even on First Class). The food range was alright, particularly, the steak sandwich and poached eggs."

First impressions of the plane were terrible. Really dated and I almost couldn't fit down the aisle (I am a size 10 woman) with my handbag it was so narrow. There was no organisation from staff during boarding. Zones were called too close together which caused busy queues and confusion. The flight itself was smooth however the food was absolutely terrible and even my partner who will eat anything could not finish.  The service was also below average. There was one notable flight attendant who had a smile on her face. The others were distant, providing no customer service to the passengers, no smiles or anything. They were even leaning over passengers in the middle section of seats to reach another air hostess because they had ran out of items. Too busy talking between themselves to care for the customers. On our second flight from Abu Dhabi to Heathrow we were about to take off and a man stumbled on and plonked himself in the spare seat next to us. He was drunk and I was shocked they would even let him on the flight in his state however I have a feeling the stairs had been taken away and it was more hassle to remove him. As the plane was taking off and accelerating (no exaggeration!) he was falling into the aisle and crawling to the toilet at the bag of the aircraft to be sick. He moved seats several times as he couldn't remember where he was. That was pure luck however the reaction of the staff was terrible. They obviously helped the drunk passenger however no apology was made to us for the inconvenience or the smell. Not a single acknowledgement. We didn't want an upgrade or anything but a simple smile and a sorry would have been nice. I was shocked that for an airline supposedly up there with Emirates this was our experience. I unfortunately booked a return and I am dreading it and I will definitely by taking my own food and snacks.

The economy-class seats are comfortable. However, we were quite disappointed with the on board service. In the Abu Dhabi flight to São Paulo there were 3 options in the dinner menu: lamb with Indian rice, chicken and a choice of pasta (gnocchi). We were in row 24 and when the service reached our seats, there was only the lamb option, all the others were already over. Most of the passengers around us would also like another option, other than the lamb, the only one available. The crew politely told us that due to the profile of the passengers, the menu had been constructed as having lamb as the preferred option. I believe that in flight to Brazil, the menu profile should be improved. Following meals included a frozen chicken sandwich, a pack of sliced apples and a snack of sweet popcorn. Light dinner at the end of the flight had one option only: chicken with penne. There were no small snacks available during a 15 hours flight. The lack of vegetarian options for those on board, came to my attention, since some people in row 23 were out of meals at the final light dinner. Onboard service is incompatible with the company's reputation.

The A330 had a dated look and the business cabin feels cramped when its busy, as was the case on this flight to Manchester. All seats feel narrow but aisle seats are to be avoided as aisles are very narrow and you are likely to bumped by everyone who walks past. The crew were ok, not particularly warm or friendly and there was no personalized greeting from the purser or cabin manager. Food was okay. Better than on the flights to Asia, but with apparent cost cutting from previous standards. The tomato soup tasted like tinned and the beef cheek was ok, but not business class standard. The supposedly ""ripe boutique cheeses"" were a joke. A wedge of tasteless cheddar and very unripe and flavourless brie. I had a steak sandwich later which was ruined by a huge piece of gristle which I almost choked on. Etihad don't have separate boarding for business class passengers so you have to queue up in the airbridge with everyone else. On a positive note the flight departed on time and arrived early, helped by a heavily padded schedule. In both hard and soft product Etihad lags a long way behind Qatar Airways and Emirates with the food particularly in need of improvement. Not worth paying for unless you can get a free upgrade or use miles."

Such a disappointment especially since I travel a lot with Etihad. Being a gold member and travelling with kids they did not assist me with my seats despite prior booking for them. The kids meals were terrible the bread was so chewy that my kids couldn't eat. The reason was it was not heated. They did not provide blankets when asked at the start of the flight as the crew informed me that the temperature was ok and if I need it later they would give them then. When I asked later, they said they had ran out of blankets. The kids bags that they give were not given to my kids despite being asked several times. Being a frequent traveler, my kids know they get a bag and expect one (spoilt I know). I got the bag only when I purchased a duty free item which when checked the very next day at Yas mall was cheaper. When I contacted the airline all they said was sorry and they will checking with the purchasing team. The ground staff in Abu Dhabi are good. Another issue is with the miles that they conveniently forget to credit and you have to follow up several times. They have no means to escalate further and it's extremely frustrating."

Furthermore, they outsource major parts of long, international flights to low-cost airline partners to save money, meaning that you pay for a supposedly premium airline, but spend over 8 hours of your flight crammed onto a short-haul, low-cost airline plane.

Very disappointing and unprofessional. We have just returned from a week in Abu Dhabi. This is the first (and last time) we have used this airline. Our six year old son was with us as this was a family holiday.  Etihad oversold the flight, so when we arrived 2.5 hours before take-off to find we only had 3 of the 4 seats we had paid for we were a little unhappy. We had pre-reserved seats but as they had also changed the aircraft this reservation didn't stand. The manner in which they dealt with it was appalling. They have a designated ""Rebooking Desk"" adjacent to the check in at Abu Dhabi which may suggest they do this a lot? Their response (including their senior supervisor) was ""sorry there aren't enough seats"". I’ve never posted a poor review before. In fact I've just left the Westin Abu Dhabi a 5 star review as they were superb. Etihad unfortunately are at the other end of the scale. They are so much smaller than Emirates (who we've flown with 40+ times) so don't have many flights operating. They said ""we are confident we can get you on the 2.30am flight"". Not ideal to hang around the airport for 14 hours then fly all night with a 6 year old. No apology was made. They made no suggestion on how they could resolve the issue or help it was very simply just tough luck. I have experienced overbooking in the US when travelling with work. Quality airlines hold the check in process then ask passengers if they are willing to travel on a later flight or codeshare. Offering upgrades and compensation. Etihad don’t even offer an apology. They won't compensate you (other than a voucher that can only be redeemed with Etihad). If accommodation is needed (as they operate so few flights) they select where you stay - and there are onsite airport hotels which I suspect aren't great so be warned. OK - then on board. The flights were also both awful. Outbound from London they decided to wait 3 hours before serving dinner (we took off at 20.45)! This meant they woke 1/2 of the plane up as they served it at midnight (3am Abu Dhabi time). They then let everyone go back to steep, then 1.5 hours later turned the lights? This was still 2 hours before landing. None of our party of 4 ate the food. It was dreadful. The inflight entertainment is very, very poor compared with leading airlines. There are limited films and many are very old. The children's selection is poor too. I'm unsure why the inflight entertainment doesn't start until 1/2 hour after take-off (once you start cruising) and they turn it off before starting the descent. The two times when you really need something to focus on are take-off & landing. Again other airlines allow this to run for the entire time you are seated. Why can't Etihad? For some reason they have opted to use wider than normal trolleys. The consequence is that if you have an aisle seat in economy you are likely to get hit by the trolley quite often. As they barely fit down the aisle. I was hit 3 times on the return flight. Never did the steward say sorry. This seems to be Etihads policy. As we taxi’d across to the stand at LHR I got a quote for a taxi from Dubai to Abu Dhabi. It’s circa 1 hour drive at £100. Next time we go to Abu Dhabi we will fly into Dubai and get a taxis. Etihad sit somewhere between a budget airline and a leading one for us. Unprofessional, uncaring, poor service, bad value."

When the seats in front of you recline, there is barely enough room to get in or out of the row - extremely claustrophobic. Also not enough toilets - there was always a queue. I was given the same sub-standard vegetarian meal twice through out the journey. They had a far better vegetarian selection on the main menu which they could have set aside for me. In my opinion, these planes are a step backwards for the travel industry as it takes forever to embark and disembark. Even getting out onto the runway seems to take forever."

Etihad staff in Abu Dhabi was arrogant and not willing to explain why seat was not available although I got a confirmation before. Business class lounge in Abu Dhabi is terrible. Business lounge staff need to get training how to handle passengers they spend a lot of money for service. Before I started my return flight from Australia to Germany I've had to change my flight data and the departing airport from MEL to SYD, this booking change was not possible over the Etihad website although they are offering ""booking change possibility by website"". It needed to contact Etihad first by phone to get this change done. This was my first experience with Etihad, I will not use this airline again and cannot recommend it."

We boarded and the plane took off on time. Service was efficient and the crew were very nice. We landed ahead of time but had to wait for a long time on the runway as there was no gate available.

Previously the food has been fine but this time the meal provided did not match the menu in any way except the kind of meat it included. I tried 2 meal options and both were disgusting and not at all what you would expect from a quality airline. I spoke to the cabin manager who was very helpful and kind and offered me extra snacks if I wanted. She explained that Etihad had previously had all catering in this route done in Abu Dhabi but they had just started to get it from Saigon. I am a frequent domestic flyer on Vietnam Airlines and the food is nothing special but what was provided to Etihad Airways was so below even Vietnam Airlines standards that I am amazed more people did not complain. Once I switched to the Abu Dhabi to London flight everything was normal and fine again."

As a Etihad gold guest member I was unable to take my daughter into the lounge prior to boarding from Abu Dhabi airport.

Apparently it depends on the mood and the person behind the desk to check you in. My friend who was also a business class passanger and a gold member left the lounge and waited by the gate for over and hour and a half. The lady at the lounge said "" oh don't worry it's not a long wait, you'll be boarding soon as you have to take a bus to the aircraft"". Very disappointed."

This review is not so much about the flight but more about the rudeness and lack of service. As a business class flyer you pay a premium for the little things such as seats, chauffeur pickup and service. Our experience so far has been far from what we thought Etihad would deliver. In Singapore the allocated pickup time for the chauffeur was not suitable so we spent time calling and explaining this and requesting another time. We understood that this had been done and waited the following day for the car, which never arrived as it was not changed as per the conversation we had, so we had to make our own way to the airport. The flight from Singapore to Abu Dhabi was fine but the staff were not friendly. The staff and food from Abu Dhabi to Rome was much better and pleasant. In Venice, we called Etihad to book the chauffeur service and were told it by their staff to call Alitalia as it was a Alitalia flight even though we booked and paid through Etihad, it is an EY flight number, plane and ticket. The care factor of the staff member was zero. We then had to call Alitalia. After four separate conversations and Alitalia confirming the water taxi on a return phone call, we have now been advised by the external company that we have a car booked. We explained it is Venice and we need a water taxi and that this was confirmed by Alitalia staff to be told by the external chauffeur company that we have to pay our own way to a designated meeting place on land to take a car. Numerous emails later and lots of time later, we are now left with no chauffeur service and each company blaming each other. If this is the business class service you get with Etihad then is it any wonder people choose to fly their competitors. We are Platinum and Platinum Plus flyers and travel constantly and wanted to experience Etihad. But we have been so disappointed in Etihad's service and the extra costs we have incurred. When a service is advertised as part of a ticket price and is listed on their and/their partners websites it should be delivered."

Aircraft was OK, as with most A330's/A340's with 8 seats abreast. Lighting was good, it has different colour of lighting that is dimmed enough to create a lighting environment to sleep, and the other good thing is that the lights are pretty much always dimmed. IFE had good movies, live TV on the HKG legs which was pretty cool. What's really bad about IFE is that it doesn't turn on until like 30 mins after take off, and it shuts down well over 30mins before landing. It's 2016, I thought airlines could manage better. What was also below expectation was the flight attendants. The AUH to MUC leg was the best, I felt like attendants were happy and cheered up, but the others I felt like I shouldn't bother them for anything, they just don't smile. One occasion there was a slight misunderstanding in what drink I wanted - no worries I just asked again, in a friendly way, but the response was ""you said you wanted xxx"" in a frustrated expression."

Flew Etihad from Abu Dhabi to Beijing. Yet another bus trip halfway to Liwa to reach the plane on departure from, and return to Abu Dhabi - the latter particularly chaotic. To be fair, as observed previously, all the Middle East airlines love the bus. Notwithstanding, on-time departure and arrival in both directions. Seating in the cheap seats I found to be cramped compared to the Chinese domestic airlines I later experienced, and the 330s are definitely showing their age. I'm not liking Etihad's practice of throwing out my 'special meal' (vegetarian) - which was fine - as if I and others have some form of disease therefore not worthy of a drink with our meal. Qatar arrange to serve special meals with all others so this is purely down to Etihad's idleness. I didn't notice the crew, which is a good thing. Temperature far too cold on the return flight."

The main reason to chose Etihad was the price, and despite the overall longer travelling time (at least 6 hours to FRA) it was worthwhile. The seating in economy class is never great, but Etihad seem to make to make it tolerable. The A330 2-4-2 configuration is pleasant enough if you travel with a partner and manage to get a window an aisle seat. Overall not a bad experience. All flights departed on time and arrived slightly ahead of schedule. Cabin service friendly, efficient, and helpful. Quality of food above average. In flight entertainment offers more than enough options. Overall a very positive experience, and one needs to consider the price of the ticket. For around EUR 500 return you can't expect business class service, and any review must take this into account. Flown business class on Etihad before, and that is a different story altogether (in a positive meaning). Just one negative remark. On the return flight from FRA to JNB we exceeded the luggage weight limit by 1.5 kgs between the two of us (i.e. 750 grams each!), and the check in clerk forced us to to unpack two books and transfer them to our hand luggage. I agree that there must be a limit, but a little bit of leverage would really be appreciated. On the other side, when you see what some passengers bring on board as hand luggage, you wonder how they got away with that.

The flight from Brisbane to Abu Dhabi with Etihad on a Boeing 787, about 13h flight. Very slow ground staff, might not be fault of Etihad but rather BNE airport, average friendliness, no issues with check-in though. Flight crew extremely bored upon boarding, no welcome, etc. I am of average size (1.75m - 75kg) and usually do not complain, but the size of the seating space is a joke for a 13h flight. I did the similar distance from Brisbane to Doha or Dubai, but never felt that locked into a seat. The seat rows are that narrow, that you can't appreciate the decent screen as it is too big for the distance you have. So watching movies is not really enjoyable. Reclining and sleeping is not really doable. Food quality is definitely not more than average and quantity is not enough. IFE with a big and good screen, average selection of movies. Wifi OK. Crew were bored and not particularly helpful, poured beer over my pants and instead of saying sorry I was explained why it happened. Toilet cleanliness for the amount of passengers quite good. Safety very good. Abu Dhabi to Berlin operated by AirBerlin on an A330, about 6h flight. Seating with more space than on the 13hr flight with Etihad and quite comfortable. Food was more and at least the same quality than on the 13h flight with Etihad. A bottle of water handed out right at the beginning, that should also be standard on a flight >10h! IFE was average, not much options, Wifi OK. Toilet cleanliness for the amount of passengers quite good. Safety very good. Overall never been that negatively surprised by such a low standard, especially of a carrier like Etihad. It clearly shows that all effort is spent on Business and First class. Ticket price was quite competitive though. Definitely do not recommend Etihad on this flight in Economy but recommend AirBerlin for this flight in Economy."

I was initially told that they can see my upgrade and also that payment was received but they would be unable to print my boarding pass. What?? I was told to call the call center. Thus I got a bit loud and eventually they did the calls and I got my boarding pass printed. Not the very best ground staff service, but at least my request was done in time. Service onboard with very attentive staff with any kind of request throughout the flight. Seat with good privacy. Lots of storage space and tables to eat or work. Seat can be converted into a flat bed, mattress provided, very soft and comfortable blanket and nice pillow. Provided pyjamas and toiletry quite good. Distance to screen perfect to watch movies in a relaxed upright or reclined position. Food of excellent quality and good selection of a la carte dishes as well as snacks. Good selection of drinks. IFE with average selection of movies. Quite good selection of music. Wifi OK. Cleanliness very good and safety very good. Overall the difference between Economy and Business is like day and night. Whereas I would not recommend Etihad on my flight in Economy I do recommend it in Business class. Etihad Business class is very expensive compared to other carriers and one should look for upgrades rather then directly booking Business."

First leg of the journey was with FlyNas (Riyadh to Abu Dhabi) chartered by Etihad which arrived 50 minutes late and resulted in me missing the second leg to London, I was forced to wait in the airport for nearly 5 hours for an issue that was not my own. I arranged to sit at the front of the economy section / took no 'hold' luggage and arrived at the airport in Riyadh 3 hours early all just to be on the safe side. The irony is that the initial delay in Riyadh was down to a passenger clearing security! Selling flights to London with a 1hr transfer time at Abu Dhabi is nothing short of irresponsible, and it’s the passenger who has to suffer. The transfer desk in Abu Dhabi was appalling with a scripted comment and a voucher to stay in a hotel which when you consider the transfer to the hotel and back and the need to attend the airport two hours before takeoff, the whole thing was nothing short of a waste of time. The return trip from Heathrow to Abu Dhabi was marginally better although late again. Where I and fellow travelers were expected to run through the terminal, scan our bags at the security point and join the bus for the plane connection with just 5 minutes to spare - do Etihad really expect their customers to worry whether they will arrive on the date or somewhere near the time printed on the ticket, experience the added anxiety of wondering whether their late arrival flight will make the stand in time for a sprint to the aircraft or suffer the indignation let alone the sheer inconvenience of a significant wait. Direct flights only people or you may get burnt - you have been warned. Thanks Etihad - not impressed."

Abu Dhabi to London on the A380, the studio seating is fantastic and slept most of the way with breakfast served 1 hour as requested before arrival. We didn't eat after takeoff as we ate in the lounge before the flight. Fast track service meant I was out of the airport with luggage and in the chauffeur car within 30 minutes. Every time I fly Etihad my luggage is coming off the belt as I arrive. Return was more of the same with no problems and slept from London to Abu Dhabi (A380) since it was the night flight with breakfast before arrival. Flight from Abu Dhabi to Bangkok (777) was great. I had light breakfast after take off and one hour out of Bangkok had the steak sandwich. The cabin crew were poised and bathrooms clean.  I've never had a bad flight even when flying economy which I do from time to time when flying with the extended family."

With feet on ottoman in front, whenever passenger in front moves, I am shaken in my seat. Result was almost no sleep. Seat also barely long enough for me at 6 feet tall. First flight from Hong Kong the cabin crew very cold and uninterested. Second flight AUH-EDI, entire family clearly bumped up from economy replete with crying newborn baby.  I was surrounded by them. Man behind me kicked my seat the whole flight, snored loudly and farted repeatedly which continually wafted its way toward me. Baby cried nonstop. Same family also held up the biz class bus to the remotely parked aircraft. Result = Biz pax on the apron waiting in the bus while economy boarded first.

The food choice was wide and since I was in the Far East for over a month I choose the Gnnochi to change my palate, but it was an awful choice and I could not even have two mouthfuls. I am not going to blame Etihad for this, as there were safer choices of noodles or biryani but I decided to be adventurous! The flight was short as we had a strong tailwind.

At Abu Dhabi when leaving the Bus into the arrival Hall it was so crowded that we could not walk inside. I noticed that it was the queue to security check, it took more than 1h to get through. On arrival to SGN the pilot announced that due to thunderstorm we would need to circle some time before we could land. After a while the pilot made an attempt to land, however aborted it again. Passengers were not informed about following step for 1hr. On the screen we could see that we were flying back, we finally landed in Pattaya airport which is 90 min way. After waiting for 1h on the runway the crew finally informed us that we would need to stay overnight and would continue the following day. I finally arrived in SGN with a near 24h delay. I do have understanding for security of all passengers, I wonder why the pilot took decision of re-routing to another country. I later learned that 10 other planes could not land on time due to weather, but none of them had to re-route. They all landed safely that evening with a slight delay. At the airport the waiting persons were also not informed about this re-routing and were left without any information about this flight. There was not a single word of apology of the pilot nor the crew.  On the way back (SGN to FRA) at the check-in counter in Saigon my luggage had a weight of 26kg, 3kg more than allowed.  The girl at the check-in insisted that I had to open my luggage, remove 3kg and store in my hand luggage.  I tried to explain to the check-in person that it would not make the plane heavier if I repack the 3kg from my check-in luggage to the hand luggage. and since it was rather inconvenient to open the luggage at the check in counter and re-pack all with a long cue behind me, I asked her if she could check-in my luggage with the 26kg. The lady was unfriendly, I understand that she is not Etihad staff, but a hired ground staff from the airport.  She finally left me with two options : either repack or go to the other counter to pay 100$+ for the overweight, otherwise she would refuse the check-in for me. "

The fares were the most reasonable of all the carriers, 30% or so lesser than Gulf or European rivals. The trip was very comfortable. Hyderabad check-in was super smooth, and as our intended carry-ons were way heavier than the allowed 7 kgs, we checked in all bags. We were concerned about missing baggage as we would leave Venice in 36 hours to go on a cruise, and any missed baggage would probably not make it to us. Thankfully, all bags arrived intact at Venice. The flight to Abu Dhabi was an A320. Seats were standard, entertainment had many options, including fairly recent movies. Kids selection was decent. The food was standard, but service was outstanding, with cabin crew going out of their way to make the kids comfortable. They got some extra goodies. Abu Dhabi was better than the reviews suggest. Only thing was that there really was a long bus drive to terminal 1, and a longish walk - 10-15 minutes to get to terminal 3, including a security check. But if you are okay walking a bit and have atleast an hour and half between flights, you should be ok. The shopping is ok. The main atrium is a bit crowded but the gates had enough seating. We found the toilets free and clean. The Abu Dhabi to Venice flight was comfy as it was practically empty.  As a result, adults slept flat on the 4 seats in the middle while the kids slept on the 2 side seats. Very comfortable night, restful sleep. The food was ok. Crew was again very efficient. This was an Alitalia flight under the Etihad flag. Not as much warmth, but polite and efficient. Will fly them again in a heartbeat."

I had been looking forward to trying their much hyped Business Studio on the A380 from Mumbai to Abu Dhabi. What a let down! The term ""studio"" is purely marketing hype. The seat is very similar to the Emirates A380 business seat although way too firm and lacking the personal mini bar. The TV screen also seemed a little smaller than Emirates and it just didn't have the same luxury feel. The biggest let down of the flight was the catering. When I saw the menu I thought they had given out the economy class one by mistake. The only starter on offer was a bland fattoush salad and the only dessert a rather tired red velvet cake. There was a choice of 2 mains, a lamb kebab (tasty enough) and a vegetarian curry. Shame on Etihad for serving such a poor business class meal. The other big let down is the on-board lounge, which is basically just a round table next to the galley, seating at most 6 people. Compared to the bar onboard Emirates A380 fleet, this is poor. Very disappointing product compared to Emirates and Qatar Airways, especially in terms of food and beverage. I will avoid in future."

The first leg with Etihad Airways from New York to Abu Dhabi was excellent. Their economy smart seat is quite comfortable although I was quite lucky to get an exit row. Its actually by far the most superior economy product I've experienced. The aircraft is beautiful from the inside out with mesmerizing mood lights and brown and beige colors filling the cabin. I was looking forward to trying out their A380 and it didn't disappoint. The IFE on the A380 is fantastic with good responsive touch, nice camera views and a user friendly interface. On the second leg it was a Boeing 777, probably not that fancy as the A380 but was better than a lot of airlines. I do believe the 10 abreast seating gets a bit cramped but on a short haul it was fine with me. In general the crew were quite friendly and the ground staff were efficient both in New York and Abu Dhabi. The food could be improved a lot."

I was shocked at the stewardess impolite acting and reply. I have thought Etihad airway's service is worst compare to airfare."

In flight the crew were one of the grumpiest I have seen, especially the chief steward who definitely had forgotten to smile or speak properly leave alone being efficient. Food orders were not taken on time and my child did not even get his order fulfilled.

Was not serviced a drink until 90 minutes after take-off and dinner was nearly 2 hours later than the time I requested. What is the point in asking if you can’t supply as requested. Arrived in Colombo but suitcase did not. Etihad had staff milling around with a list of passengers whose cases had not arrived. My name not on list, had to queue to fill in forms, after about an hour I was told my case was still in Abu Dhabi but would be flown out on the afternoon flight and would be delivered late afternoon. Was given a receipt with contact number. Case did not arrive on the Friday evening. The number given was only contactable 8am to 4.30 pm. Saturday office was closed. Tried to contact Etihad offices in Colombo Saturday morning, only open to 12.30 and closed Sunday. No one picked up the phone. The hotel were very kind and said they would try to assist. Finally got a call Saturday evening to say case had arrived at airport. This was delivered early hours of Sunday morning I sent an email complaint to Etihad through their website on the Saturday and to date 10 days later still have not received any response. Only an automated one to say someone would get back to me, sent a chaser email and still no response. On my return complained to check in staff and was passed to a supervisor who said he would ensure I got a response and was given 45 pounds. But still no response It’s clear once you have paid for your ticket they could not give a damn about customer service. I think they must have paid for the 2016 award.

Both aircraft had shown age but seats were comfortable though the 3 o'clock arrival time in Jakarta is a little ill advised as the weather can be tricky at that time of day though it is perfect to connect with Garuda flights within Indonesia which was the case with us. The IFE on Etihad Airways does not compare with Emirates or Qatar Airways who both have a much larger collection, but this does not mean it is lacking or the selection is not up to date - I was comparing them to the best of the best. The food was a very good selection and you set the time and they will deliver the portions are generous too, all cabin staff were very attentive and introduced themselves to the passengers by name and were prompt if called. Though Etihad have their little issues and fall a little short of their major two competitors they are very competitive with their marketing scheme and innovate to cone up with new ideas.

For the same connection to Frankfurt, they gave hotel rooms inside airport to passengers with German passports. When it came to our turn, they asked us what are our passport countries, mine is Vietnamese and my husband is Greek. So he said he would give hotel voucher for my husband to stay in a hotel outside of the airport, while giving me a lounge voucher to stay inside. We excused him that we are husband and wife so it's very inconvenient to stay apart. He apologized that he didn't know we are couple!  We asked him if he can give us a hotel room inside the airport, he said its already full. My husband asked him since we have to take the train from Frankfurt to go to Berlin, and we may miss it, if he could connect us to fly directly to Berlin instead of Frankfurt. He said there was only one flight per day, which we might have to wait 24 hours, because the flight just left. Later we found there was a flight with Air Berlin (their partner) to fly to Berlin the next morning. I talked with some Vietnamese passengers inside the airport, who were on the same flight with me from Ho Chi Minh City, they connected to fly to Switzerland and other locations. The connecting staff gave them only meal vouchers, not even access to lounge like me. I told them they could ask for lounge or even hotel. But they didn't want.

The return journey mirrored the outward trip. The leg between Perth and Abu Dhabi outward and Abu Dhabi to Perth inward was with Etihad Airways who codeshare with KLM / Air France. On the outward bound we chose to have dinner (we took off shortly after 5pm) at 7pm but when the time came we were told that the food had largely run out and all that remained was some soup. This was accepted in our stride as sometimes even with the best of intentions things can go wrong. However the service by Flight Attendants on this leg was very ordinary. On the way return journey (Abu Dhabi to Perth) we came off a KLM Boeing 787 where the service by the Flight Attendants was simply superb and then boarded the Etihad Boeing 787 for the last leg home. The difference in standard of service in the Business Class cabin between KLM and Etihad was like chalk and cheese. The Etihad cabin crew were all but invisible. I finally gave up waiting for a meal to be brought around and went to sleep. Whilst the Etihad aircraft was new, clean and comfortable the standard of the cabin crew was probably the worst I have ever encountered. Where the Flight Attendants managed to hide during the trip is a mystery. To say that Etihad Flight Attendants are not on the same page as Singapore, KLM, Air France, Emirates or Qantas is an understatement. "

We took the middle seats as we're travelling together, seats are front and back-facing, odd rows are front-facing. Front-facing seats are also set close together, so if you're travelling alone, choose either a single seat or a back-facing seat to avoid sitting too close to a stranger. Seats slid down to a very comfortable bed - some business class seats slide into a somewhat claustrophobic space for your feet, but I didn't feel it with the Business Class Studio. Pillow and comforter were great and I had a good sleep on a 6+ hour flight. Food service was prompt and friendly, attention to detail by the steward/stewardess was very good. Food itself was excellent - had a gnocchi dish that could have been served right out of an Italian restaurant kitchen. The magic kind of ends when you land at Abu Dhabi airport and realise that you are not parked at a gate, and you actually have to go down the portable steps into a bus that drives you for another 15 minutes before pulling up at the terminal. Although we did get a 'business class bus' (complete with leather seats) for one of the legs, it's not a great experience after being on the 787. Next leg was on the A330 on the older Business Class seat. Much narrower seat but can't say that I was a lot less comfortable - obviously if given a choice, I would have picked the 787 Business Class Studio over this seat!). Still had a good sleep and a good breakfast, other than the fact that the plane did not have running water on board (they had bottles of water sitting in the toilets, thankfully the toilet did flush). They couldn't serve hot drinks on board without running water, so everyone had to live with juices and water for breakfast. The Business Class Lounge at Terminal 3 had the spa and shave service - my husband got a hot shave for US$15 and was pleased with the result. I tried to book a spa treatment but they were full for the hour - additionally, they must have removed the 15 minutes complimentary treatment for Business Class passengers (which I had read about prior to our trip) because the notice at the spa only mentioned First Class passengers receiving the complimentary treatment. Having read some horrible reviews of missing/delayed luggage, we're happy our three checked-in bags arrived safely on the way out and on the way back. However, we did experience flight delays on our flights out and back to Singapore - on our flight out from Abu Dhabi, the airport baggage tracking system broke down and all flights were grounded because all baggage couldn't be traced. Flight delayed by about 1.5 hours. On the way back to Singapore from Abu Dhabi, air traffic was apparently too heavy for us to leave on time. Flight delayed by about 1 hour. Overall, enjoyable flights. Would have been even more enjoyable without having to stopover at Abu Dhabi airport, but flight experience itself was good."

I noticed the staff seemed in chaos as they didn't have enough food. Staff were okay, they seemed to have to make the best of things. Arrival was on time even with delays. I have to say my experiences with all the Gulf airlines have not been good and will seriously think only of the Asian Airlines in the future. Yes, Etihad offer cheap fares and you only get what you pay for."

Check in was swift and the Radisson lounge is acceptable for an airport which is Tribhuvan Itnl. The equipment used was a narrow body so the J class seats were no better than long haul premium economy class. The duration of the flight is 4.45 hrs so a wide body with better seats and F&B service is being missed. Do not be misguided by their adverts on TV , if your journey involves a narrow body the potrayed services shown are simply NA on these."

Ritu Bansal",,29th June 2016,Business,Economy Class,ZRH to DEL via AUH,June 2016,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,1,no,1,"Zurich to New Delhi via Abu Dhabi. When I checked in at Zurich airport, I was not given my 2nd boarding pass i.e. from Abu Dhabi to New Delhi. On asking I was told you are on priority and will be given the boarding pass at Abu Dhabi airport. This was a bit strange but I left it. On reaching Abu Dhabi airport, I approached the Transfer Desk at the arrivals terminal. I had wait for 15-20 minutes before my turn came. This was as bad as checking in all over again. But had no choice. When I finally reached the counter and presented my papers, I was told that the flight was full and there are no seats. I was surprised. I had a confirmed seat in my hand but no seat. My flight was scheduled to leave Abu Dhabi at 10:00 pm and it was around 7:45 pm. The counter guy made a call and after a long time told me that he can put me on a flight next day after noon at 2:00 pm which was 16 hours after my scheduled flight. When I told him that was too late, he made me wait for more time and finally offered to put me on a flight to Mumbai and then from there to New Delhi - so I would again reach New Delhi late afternoon the next day. This was appalling. In the meantime I realised that all the counters at the transfer desk had the same problem. Etihad had overbooked all flights and passengers were being harassed. People were going to Egypt or Australia or Hyderabad. There were other flights during the night and early morning from Abu Dhabi to New Delhi but Etihad had overbooked all and I could not get a seat on any flight. Finally the counter guy told me that they could not help me and I should go to transfer desk on terminal 1. By this time the airport security area through which I had to pass to go to Terminal 1 had become extremely crowded. There was no air conditioning.  No queue and total chaos. With great difficulty, I managed to pass through that and reached the Transfer Desk. The guy at the counter quickly offered me a seat on a 2:55 am flight, a meal voucher and 200$ compensation. I quickly accepted the deal. But now the set in the surprise: 200$ voucher could be used only on Etihad Airways travel. Not much use if I did not spend another 1000$ first to book an Etihad airways ticket. After handing over the above voucher the guy came up with the bomber that there are no seats on the 2:55 am flight and he can only put me on the 2:50 pm flight. This was crazy. Since then I have tried my level best, spoke to the supervisor and Etihad personnel on phone. Everyone promised the best but did not deliver anything. And here I am sitting in the lounge. They haven't even provided me with a hotel voucher so that at least I can get some much needed rest. If this is called first class service than what can be more pathetic is anybody's guess. Anybody planning to travel Etihad - please think twice. It's highly possible that you will get stranded like me."

P Johnson",A380 and A340,28th June 2016,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,SYD to AMS via AUH,January 2016,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,2,"  To begin this review, it must be noted I am a tall guy, measuring in at 202 cm/6ft 8in and 130 kg. Travelling out, comfort: Travelling from Amsterdam to Sydney, with a short lay over in Abu Dhabi, we were on two A340-500's. The leg room wasn't ideal, but it was doable. Service: The servicing staff was ok. Nothing fancy, but okay. At the end of the flight, they offer vouchers for their air-miles service, and it is clear that the stewards/desses are paid extra if they can sign on new people to the air-miles scheme. It was a little intimidating. Travelling home, comfort: Travelling Sydney to Abu Dhabi, we found ourselves once again on an A380-800. The leg room was appalling. My girlfriend at 173 cm was under pressure from the legroom. But there was simply no way for me to fit in those seats. Add to that, that my seat couldn't extend back, which meant I was stuck between the reclined seat in front of me and my own seat. I could literally see the forehead of the guy in front of me. We were told stories of how the legroom on the A380 is larger than normal. But the legroom on the A340 is better by at least 5 cm. During our flight, my entertainment system broke down, and it took 50 minutes to bring it back online, and no one seemed to understand the problem or offer a solution better than ""we have to restart the system - we dont know how long it will take"". If this didn't make us feel like cattle, the patronising crew, that seemed almost forced to serve us drinks, did. Etihad clearly caters for the wealthy with their first class videos, that everyone gets to see before takeoff. In the end, Etihad made us feel like cattle, like never before. Lucky for us, Singapore Airlines and Qatar Airways are offering enough competition to challenge Etihad."

I always fly with Etihad as I find it hard to fault them. The check-in is easy, the lounge is lovely, the service onboard is wonderful and then arrival procedures are always simple. I always travel in Business Class and love the seats and layout on the A380. I was in seat 16F on this occasion as I was travelling with my Mum, who was is 16E. These seats are perfect for people travelling together as you can push the partition down and chat. But if you are travelling on your own, its just as easy to press a button and put the partition up, so you have privacy. Onboard the IFE is great, the large tv is awesome and the choice is superb. So many movies to watch. I also love the fact that you can eat whenever you want. You do not have to wait for the cabin crew to tell you when to eat. The food onboard was impeccable. I had lentil soup and crusty bread, followed by fillet of beef with fondant potato, followed by cheese and biscuits. All washed down with an amaretti. Perfect. Sleep is easy as well, as the fully flat bed is comfy and I was able to get about 3 hours sleep. The cabin crew are lovely. So smiling and friendly and nothing was too much trouble. Always coming to ask if I needed anything or simply if I was ok. The only fly in the ointment I suppose is luggage handling as for the third time in a row, my cases did not make it on the flight from Abu Dhabi back to Muscat. I was however updated regularly as to where they were and they arrived the next day. Wifi can be a bit sketchy at times. I would say that it doesn't work more often than it does work. Other than these things, I cannot find anything bad to say about them. Perfect from start to finish."

Opted for Etihad as it had the best price at the time. We were disappointed with the overall experience. I have flown this airline a few years back and the standards have dropped considerably. The seating was uncomfortable, and the entertainment options in the aircraft were nothing much to write home about. The meal was ordinary compared to other airlines. If Etihad wants to be considered as one of the premium airlines as it claims to be, it needs to improve. The staff were rude to our fellow passengers (for no apparent reason) and very inefficient. Not sure whether I would like to fly them again."

Not only does it boast a wide selection of beers, wines and spirits, they also have a barber, masseuse and beautician (complimentary to first class passengers but reasonably priced for others, e.g. Dh90 for a haircut). Upon boarding the aircraft, I was soon welcomed with a champagne and refreshing hot towel. The FA's led by an very experienced F&B Manager ensured my journey was incredibly enjoyable and they gladly responded to my requests no matter the hour. As for the seat and IFE, let’s just say I did not want to leave the aircraft because I was so comfortable! Lastly - I found the inflight wifi which is provided by T-Mobile to be reasonably priced (USD 22 for the entire 14.5hr flight)."

Original arrival time in Stuttgart 7am. We presumed Etihad would change our booking according to the new connection they were selling on the website that day (from Abu Dhabi via Belgrad to Stuttgart, arrival time around 8 am) but in Abu Dhabi they lied to our faces and said there was no such connection.  There was a flight departing to Belgrad while we were at the airport! So they booked us on a flight to Berlin but said the flights from Berlin to Stuttgart were already full so we would have to wait 8 hours in Berlin before flying to Stuttgart (arrival time 4.20pm). Etihad wouldn't provide any food vouchers or anything and no food on the last flight from Berlin to Stuttgart (operated by Air Berlin). The Etihad flight from Jakarta to Abu Dhabi wasn't great either, cabin crew seemed to be stressed out and unsmiling. Drinks were hard to come by, food portion size was small and not every option available. They ran out of vegeterian food. When we tried to order a veggie meal online beforehand it didn't work. When we booked we didn't even know that half of the flights would be operated by Air Berlin, because Etihad sells them as Etihad flights. So sad that we went for Etihad as there were other options for the same price when we booked in the first place. Stay away from Etihad and Air Berlin! "

One other weakness, lengthy announcements, for example before take-off and after landing, appeared to be well paced and clear in Arabic; in English they were very staccato to the point of being unintelligible.

One cannot complain about the service on Etihad Airways as there is none to complain about. This last trip to Abu Dhabi was without doubt the worst. Settled in, had a drink while waiting to take off and gave the chef my meal order. 2 hours from landing and a 13 hour flight, no food, no drinks and even my potato chips were removed from my cabin! I was offered no bedding, and only had a neck cushion and rug which became unbearable. Asked where my meal was and told that nothing could be served as the chef was on his break - thought it was dining on demand? I couldn't have breakfast because I didn't order any! Went to economy looking for food, but it was full. Found a seat at the back of business and sat there for the remaining 2 hours of the flight. I was at least given a pillow and a blanket! Was offered a steak sandwich 1/2 an hour before landing and that was all I got all trip. When I arrived at Abu Dhabi airport, I went to the lounge and refused to leave until management addressed my concerns. After about an hour and a half a manager came and promised me the world of empty promises! Asked my travel agent to book the return flight in Business as First was so bad, only to be told it would cost me $2,000 to downgrade.

There was a delay of more than one hour for take off. The food onboard was horrible with very less choice. For a thirteen hour flight they served a lunch, a bag of pretzels, a bun and a vegetarian light meal with no choices. We did not receive all four bags after reaching Kochi. If they want only first and business class passengers to fly with them then they should stop the economy class. Regarding in-flight entertainment the less said better it is.

My business class flatbed-seat malfunctioned on the flight from BKK to AUH. The seat could not recline and rendering the seat being worse for comfort than an economy seat but cost a lot of money. It felt like sitting in an emergency door exit economy class seat but could not recline. Despite the crew’s attempt to fix the seat before and after the meal they could not fix it. I expected to be offered a different seat or  upgraded to  first class given that all business class seats were not available but nothing was done despite my complaint. Ittook the crew nearly four hours after take off to serve the main course, which was more than half of my flight duration where I had planned to have to a good long hour of sleep after the meal. There are also minor points such as the use of buses to transfer passengers from the gate to the plane in AUH. Whilst I have been offered by the ground team in AUH a compensation of 15,000 Etihad miles, which I did think it was adequate for my troubles. I subsequently made a written complaint to ensure that my inbound leg of the trip would be trouble free, and I had expected to hear further assurance prior to my inbound flights to BKK, (which was a week later), but I received nothing, other than an email that the airline would investigate and get back. The airline did not take my complaint seriously and I could not believe it that I was assigned to the exact same seat with the outbound flight that had the problem on a similar aircraft that I have made a complaint, I was very upset fearing that it might be the exact same aircraft and I had to face the same problem all over again (a good evidence of the airline ignorance to my complaint) and to make it worst, one of my travelling group, had the same issue with her seat that I had on the outbound trip and could not recline at all. Fortunately the crew eventually could fix it.  I followed up again a few weeks after the trip. They offered me the total of 20,000 miles which cannot even upgrade me from economy to business class on the same route. I  asked for the equivalent mileages (which might not guarantee that I can upgrade my seat as the mileage upgrade is subject to quota and availability, not to mention that if I choose to use the miles I will have to pay for another flight to the airline that I do not want to fly with again). I wouldn't ask for any complimentary mileage if I had gotten a properly functioning seat that I had paid a lot of money for! It has now been months since my first complaint and I tried to follow up but I just received an email saying that they “hope you will accept the offer we have previously made. We now regard this matter as closed”. "

What on earth possessed Etihad to squeeze 10 seats across their 777s? Many airlines (Thai, Singapore etc) have 9 across, in a 3-3-3 configuration. The 10th seat on Etihad makes for a very narrow seat indeed. The flight itself was ok. Good meal, IFE had a reasonable selection. This flight was operated using a Jet Airways 777, which has an identical seating configuration to Etihad. Cabin crew helpful and friendly, and especially good with our young daughter who was very tired. If only Etihad didn't have those ridiculously narrow seats.

The flexible dining option is a bonus and all food options of good quality and delivered at specified times. They made a real effort to make my son feel welcome. This was all the more impressive given that it was a full flight. A380 from AUH to LHR. One of the main problems with EY11 is it operates at a tiring time of day.

We often choose to fly out of Abu Dhabi rather than Dubai, where we live because EY provide a convenient two way limo service and we find Abu Dhabi Airport less stressful than Dubai. It's usually a B777 which is fine. The flight was fine. Late push back because of arrival scheduling and the usual 1-2-1 offset seating in Business Class. If you are travelling alone it's best to go for the odd numbered rows (5,7,9 etc) which are more private window seats rather than the aisle focused even numbered seats (6,8 etc). Likewise, if you are with a partner and you want to be together, go for the odd row numbered central seats which are actually together. The usual pretty good cabin crew and the Cabin Manager was efficient. The IFE is pretty poor - that's one element that lets them down and the food was a bit cold to the table but maybe that was my fault for asking for a short delay in serving. The onboard phone service was a bit hit and miss as usual. I can't help the impression that the overall product offering in Business Class is not what it used to be, probably to save costs. Poor content but pretty bag amenity kits, no pyjamas, no little flowers in their vases, no cologne in the bathrooms etc. It seems that the intention is to provide a ""premium economy"" experience rather than a downgraded first class but I suppose that is what happens when an airline starts to cut costs. Arrival in Dublin was 15 minutes late and disembarkation was rapid and via the front door for a change."

We flew four journeys and had issues on three of them, having never raised an issue with an airline at all over the past thirty years of flying. I can't get a response from their laughably entitled ""Guest Relations Support"" department. On the outward first leg my entertainment system didn't work - no great problem, wouldn't complain, brought it to the attention of cabin crew who said they'd reset it but never checked. On the next leg our luggage was left behind at Abu Dhabi - apparently a regular occurrence. I understand that this is an occupational hazard of flying. We had it delivered 24 hours later having been given three different times for its delivery to our private address. On the first leg of the return journey I was trapped in a seat which was unable to recline, causing acute discomfort and backache. This was what prompted me to complain in the first instance. I received a holding reply then a request for further information and now heard nothing for eight days in response to that information being sent. Cabin and ground crew were generally pleasant and reasonably efficient but I agree with others that the meals are pretty poor. I have now abandoned Etihad despite holding their credit cards and having intended to make them my carrier of choice. Very disappointing - most particularly in their absolute lack of empathy and care for their consumers."

The second flight on the A380 was another story. The seats were so narrow. There was nowhere to put your elbows. I has an isle seat and my elbows were constantly being bumped by crew and passengers. I also noticed how narrow the isles were too. Although the seat was comfortable, the legroom was almost nil and my knees were always up against the seat in front of me making it impossible to get any sleep.

First flight was ok but the stewards were not very interested in service. Food I can say was abysmal, really poor and I would go as far as the worst slop I have had on an airline. I don't mean just this flight, but every flight with Etihad has the same substandard meals. Hence we always bring a lunch when we can to counter this. The second flight was something the same - stewards were nowhere to be seen, no juice being offered periodically. The meal was offered maybe 2 hours before landing, a breakfast which was rushed and inedible. Between the meals and the lack of interest shown by the stewards I am changing my airline of choice. Price drove me to this airline but I will move to another as Etihad Airways does not show their customers enough interest or their frequent flyer customers."

I'm a silver frequent flyer of Air Serbia and Etihad Airways. Some weeks ago I bought a ticket from Belgrade to Thailand and back via Etihad. I chose to travel with Etihad. Before I purchased the ticket I've checked with Etihad Airways about having 2 pieces of baggages 23kg each, using lounges on connecting airports and they confirmed all of that. When I bought the ticket I choose type of meals and seats for the flights. During my route out to Thailand everything was as expected without any problems. A few days before I was to fly back I received e-mail from Etihad reminding me about return flight, offering to check-in online and confirming my seats. My suffering started the moment I arrived at Bangkok Airport. The flight was operated by Jet Airways and they refused to check me in without paying extra for excess baggage (200USD) although they are Etihad partner. They didn't provide me seats and food that I had already confirmed in e-mail and was provided on my way to Thailand. Staff was rude. In Mumbai I thought it would be better since there is Etihad Airways staff but they were worse. Not helping with seats nor food, nor being polite. Also I was denied excess to lounge in Mumbai without a reason although I have right and I confirmed that before buying ticket. Finally I thought in Abu Dhabi everything will be resolved but the headquarters are the worst. There was an employee yelling at me for their mistakes! It's been a month and no resolution.  They say they will refund me money but it's been a month and they didn't even asked for my bank account number. They replied to me only after I shared my experience online and when I found their CEO's e-mail and included him in correspondence. On every step of my trip there was a problem. My last flight back home was Air Serbia so I was relieved because I am their frequent flyer and that is my national airline, (unfortunately owned by Etihad Airways) but they still have old standards of hospitality and good service - unlike Etihad. From my experience even Jet Airways is more professional then Etihad.  I travel a lot and I can recommend other companies like Emirates, Turkish Airlines, Air Serbia, Lufthansa."

After all this was done, once you pass security and are about to board the flight, there is an Etihad rep standing there with a weighing machine to weigh your hand baggage again. There were so many upset customers, 1 passenger had reshuffled things between her purse and hand baggage and the weight went up.

The lounges at all airports were excellent with waiter service available at all locations as well as an all day menu. The A380 upper deck is quiet and the business suite is excellent, it is worth noting that if you are traveling as a couple you should book the forward facing centre seats as the other options will not allow you to sit together. Etihad offer the flexible dining option and my only small criticism is that this means service can sometimes be a bit hit or miss however this is easily resolved by requesting a flight attendant who will happily get you whatever you want. The food quality and choice was excellent and the cabin crew were friendly and really did try to make sure that you had everything you needed. On each flight the flight attendant introduced themselves and asked if you had any questions or requirements during the flight, on one leg my wife decided not to eat and they double checked before landing that she didn't want a quick snack, again good attention to detail. The inflight entertainment is good, particularly the live sport, I watched a UK premiership match live in the air, something I wouldn't have been able to do on the ground.

We flew Manchester to Sydney via Abu Dhabi in October and flew Manchester to Abu Dhabi in February and on all flights it was the Boeing 777 (3-4-3 seating). The seats were rock hard, both me and my husband had to sit on our blankets and cushions for some padding. We are in our early 60s and I weigh 8stone 10lbs and my hubby weighs 12 stone 6lbs, so we are by mo means skinny or overweight and we were uncomfortable on all flights. These planes are old and obviously well worn. The seats are also very narrow so it was very uncomfortable trying to eat our meals. We are well travelled and the meals on these flights were not good quality. In fact we have flown on no frills airlines and have had better meals. I cannot understand how anyone would travel on Etihad if they have the choice of Emirates.  To make things worse they now only allow 23kgs in economy instead of the 30kgs pre Sept 2015. I think that is disgusting on long haul flights. Hopefully we will never fly Etihad again. "

I was told that I would receive a compensation for this delay. I submitted all the required paperwork to Etihad Airways but no response. I sent them 7 reminder emails over the last 6 months. I have also called them twice, both times I was told that they had informed the baggage department in Abu Dhabi to process my compensation and assured me I would receive my compensation within the week. Nothing so far. I believe that Etihad never intended to pay me a compensation, and just said so to calm me down when my bag was lost. At this point I don't care so much about the compensation, which is a minimal amount. I just want to hold Etihad accountable for their earlier statements."

The online check in was fast and efficient. We boarded on time and managed to arrive earlier than expected - a bonus. The seats were narrow and not that soft/comfortable. It did not help that the flight was full. The cabin crew were attentive and helpful. The food was okay but I did not like the menu - a matter of personal preference. Inflight entertainment is good, but, Emirates has a more extensive collection. Overall, Etihad is a good airline, but, far from being great."

Next morning flight to Paris, they did not upgrade to business while the entire business was empty. Lost out on our Disney park tickets (pre booked) and one day hotel (pre booked at Paris) due to their delay. After repeated use of their Twitter handle, they responded and gave me airmiles as a compensation for all my trouble. Sorry but being a frequent flyer, I am not flying them again. I should have read reviews here before booking with them. Whatever I saved on airfare (they were cheaper than Swiss or Air France) got lost due to delays."

Still haven't flown yet (April 2016) and already our itinerary has been changed 4 times. The last 2 showed that our previously confirmed return seats were eliminated and showed that we had to check in. Also surcharged $675.00 for fuel even though fuel prices are at 12 year record lows. Complaints have gone unresponded to, even though we were told that someone would respond. That included a telephone call that I am still waiting for. If this is just the type of service you get on the ground, then I can just imagine how bad it is going to be if we get to get on board at all."

The seats were a little tight for a business class cabin, but if you sit in a aisle seat they are not too bad. Food was good but one complaint with Etihad is they never have enough meals onboard, so you always end up with a second choice. If you want to guarantee your meal choice you need to sit two lines from the back. Abu Dhabi was a very uncomfortable experience, buses were laid on for arriving passengers. Everybody was herded into a small entrance with hundreds of other people in the same queue from other aircraft disembarking. I have to say this was one of the most disorganised places I have ever experienced it can only described as a scrum. People pushing, others confused and the ground staff unwilling to assist. Fast Track pass given to Business CIass customers that was totally useless. Spent 60 minutes trying to get through a transfer desk that was equally disorganised. Sadly I did not make it to the lounge due to Etihad's total disorganisation. Once again trying to board to BKK was total chaos, firstly Etihad Ground Staff do not have sufficient training to control a crowd and secondly the customers seem to leave their brains at home when it comes to listen to various commands."

The bad, Etihad trying the old carry on baggage scam and weighed my carry on and inspected it's dimensions. If it was not to the new rules then it's big dollars. Wanted 270 Euros if I wanted an exit seat - unacceptable if one has not been purchased before flight and is available on the day.

The cabin crew were attentive and worried about me during this time and being a girl travelling alone, this was very comforting. On arriving in Abu Dhabi, I was taken to the medical assessment area where I was taken care of and it was recommended that I did not take my connecting flight.  I was taken to the Etihad Transfer Desk where ground staff organised a hotel for the night and booked me on the same flight 24 hours later, all complimentary. I had a great rest and was feeling much better to travel the next day. I wanted to say thank you for your assistance and care.

For the last 3 months I have sent countless emails without a single reply from the Etihad Airways baggage claim team or their supposed feedback team. The level of customer service is completely unsatisfactory and downright unprofessional. It is simply not good enough.

Unable to check in online for whatever reason, however I noticed the bagdrop at T4 was the same length as the check in line! Boarding quick I booked the front seat 40J on the lower deck, full flight but seat was fine, with no seat in front and lots of room. PTV worked well, great screen and noise cancelling headset. Food and service was okay. Landed about 10 min late which with a short 45 min connection for the connection to DXB (via road) meant missing the bus with no options for 3 hrs. I chose to pay for a taxi myself. Etihad Airways  ground staff at AUH are pretty useless and uninterested. Return checked in at the Ethiad Travel Mall in Dubai with connection to AUH via road, bags checked to LHR. Once at AUH quick security I also paid for a lounge which was okay. Again seat 40J. Flight departed on time at 02:30am, a quick snack before lights out, breakfast served about 2 hrs out of Heathrow. The trip was fine as expected. I might try again in business class for the right price but would probably opt for Qatar Airways given the choice."

Then they changed my single stop flight to a triple stop 32 hour nightmare. No apologies, no refund, no explanation. During this ordeal, I was told by one of the so called Etihad Airways staff in Abu Dhabi that we would be upgraded to business class in order to access the lounge in at least 1 of the legs of this hellish flight. Not only did that not happen, and I had to spend a total of 11 hours in transit walking around airport like a gypsy, we had no food on the last leg of the flight. To top it all, after 32 hours they lost both out luggage, despite confirmations at each leg of the way that the luggage was on board. Yes, the planes were pretty, but that can be taken for granted on all these airlines. This was by far the worst airline I ever flown on. The cheap fare is not worth it."

I fly from UK to and from Asia several times a year in economy and choose Etihad Airways. Fares are competitive and service excellent. On the last occasion the flight from Kuala Lumpur was delayed to mean the connection in Abu Dhabi for the flight to LHR was missed but I received notification of the change in flight times well in advance, and was kept informed of what was going on. I always check in online and the process is very smooth when I turn up to the airport in person.  Service and food on both flights was also fine.  Crew were busy - full flights but were attentive and available. Abu Dhabi airport struggles to keep up with the movements of passengers at peak times so the airport is pretty congested when you arrive there early morning or late at night so queues at transit security are always long. Also the use of coaching gates and longish bus rides from aircraft to terminal is not what I like but seems unavoidable given the rapid growth at AUH - I look forward to the airport enhancements."

Chose Etihad as they offered a slghtly cheaper fare and I flew with them a couple of times for business purposes which were good experiences. Flights arrived slightly ahead of schedule and layover in Abu Dhabi was bearable. A330 between BRU and AUH is comfortable with good seat width and legroom - being 1m90 tall it is possible to fully stretch my legs under the seat in front. The B777 (3 class) is another story - the seat width is ok if you take the window seat (not as claustrophobic as I read). The legroom was however limited by the support bar of the seat in front and it is not possible to fit your leg in between the bar and the side of the plane. This makes it rather uncomfortable for a 13h flight. Maybe an aisle seat would have been slightly better. Service from the staff was very good on the flights between BRU and AUH. Friendly with a smile, and frequent drinks service. Between AUH and MEL it was not as good but still okay. Food was good except for the breakfasts. It’s announced as a ‘light breakfast’ on the menu but it is heavy and sweet. IFE was ok but lacked comedy shows episodes. The touchscreens are not the best but with the remote it can be navigated quickly. In short their A330 service is very good and would fly them again. I'd however avoid an Etihad long haul B777 flight in the future if competition offers similar prices."

I asked for another blanket 4 times altogether and kept being told they were busy. One attendant told me to look around at how busy they all were as if I was being ridiculous to expect an extra blanket after waiting almost an hour. The staff never came round to offer drinks; they repeatedly ignored people's call requests for attendance; even just the basics like eye contact and a friendly smile or asking if we were OK were noticeably absent. I had an uncomfortable flight and will not travel with Etihad again. It made me realise what a superior airline Qatar is.

I had a 4 hour stop over in Abu Dhabi which wasnt very good, as most of us were tired and just walked to the gate and chilled out before the final leg - but most people was left standing or sitting on the tiled floor because they didn't open the transit lounge for our gate. Eventually somebody moved the barriers and open up the area themselves which led to people moving in like sardines as it was getting very busy in the walkway at this time. It didn't take long for the customs people to appear from nowhere and throw everybody out and once again to go through our second security check before we could just sit down. Apart from that poor effort of the staff the food was nice and they come around with water often. They dont seem to advertise snacks and extra drinks out of meal times like other airlines.

I am not exaggerating when I say not punctual, as I frequently fly back and forth between Singapore and Abu Dhabi. Longest delay was 90+ minutes. In Abu Dhabi, many times we have to take a bus to the airport for immigration, which again, after 7 hours of flying, you need to squeeze with the rest of the passengers from the plane, making it unpleasant. Initially the plane was a A330, which was small and congested, and now a Boeing 787, aisle is small and the trolley constantly will hit you if you ever sit on the aisle. The food quality has dropped, with Etihad opting for a more exotic selection of food, but turned out not to be good. In all, rather disappointed with Etihad considering the cost and the service provided. Punctuality is the major flaw in Etihad. Etihad does have friendly stewardess who can speak multiple languages and cater to your needs. "

I booked business class tickets on Etihad early 2015 for a December flight from New York to Delhi via Abu Dhabi. The service on the ground was pretty good, as was the business seat on the flight. However, halfway through my flight to Abu Dhabi, the hostess approached me and said that one of my bags was left in NYC. Way to ruin the rest of my flight! She mentioned that it would be on the next flight 3 hours later and get to Delhi the same night, guaranteed. During the layover at Abu Dhabi, I checked the status of the bag, and Etihad said that it was all a misunderstanding, the bag had not in fact been left behind. So I arrived at Delhi expecting to find my bag. After waiting a full hour for the bag to come after being reassured by ground staff that I simply had to wait a ""couple more minutes"" I decided to talk to the lost baggage people. They had absolutely no clue what they were doing and haphazardly wrote me and incomplete missing baggage report to shuffle me out of their way. They also said that the bag would be delivered within 12 hours. After waiting 24 hours and calling the phone number they gave me at least 20 times (no joke), I finally got a response. Etihad said that they didn't know where the bag was. Anyway, to summarize the rest of the story, I got the bag 3 days later. All in all, Etihad Airways treated a business class passenger and family horribly. They didn't pick up the phone for the most part, were irresponsible both on ground and in the air, and were unable to handle the situation once it had happened. "

I refused this option and was told we would be put up in a hotel in Abu Dhabi. My daughter holds both Irish and Thai passports. She was travelling on the Thai passport but we needed a visa to leave the airport which we were told would not be a problem but eventually was. Then discovered my daughter's Irish passport was out of date (my fault obviously). So we had to stay within the airport. The result was spending the next 24hrs in Abu Dhabi airport spending the night in a cell-like room. We could not buy new clothes in duty free (Plenty of Prada sunglasses or Tag watches though). Eventually arriving in Phuket almost three days after departing from Dublin. What bothered me most was the lying/lack of proper management/brainless decision making/arrogance of some staff members which led to this situation happening in the first place. While I would never say never again, I will be checking out any and all alternatives next time."

I had 2 stops and the routing was ORD-AUH-DEL-BLR, with DEL-BLR on Etihad's partner Jet Airways. My dissappointment began right at ORD. There was a huge crowd at check-in and the staff were visibly uninterested in their work. Got my boarding pass after waiting for an hour. My long name was not printed fully on the boarding pass but the staff said it was alright. Yet, the TSA refused to let me in and back I went to the counter - where I was made to wait in line again! Then, the staff wrote the missing characters of my name on the pass with a pen, signed it and said that should work, and it did. Why could this not have been done earlier? This might not have been new to them since long names are fairly common where I fly to! Past this, my disappointment got much bigger towards the end of the flight. Both ORD-AUH EY150 and AUH-DEL EY224 were delayed, because of which I missed my DEL-BLR Jet Airways 8 pm flight. Etihad had no single point of contact at DEL while Jet Airways refused to put us on the next flight without 'talking' to Etihad. Some guy, supposedly the Etihad staff at DEL (though he had an Air India name tag and no Etihad naming at the counter) wrote down our names and booking reference in a used piece of paper and disappeared for the next three hours. The stranded passengers were left at the Jet Airways counter. Jet Airways staff never cared anyway and left work as it got late! So much for the hyped Jet-Etihad partnership. Another group of stranded passengers found the absconding Etihad guy and his colleagues somewhere else in the terminal, informed us and then we were given connecting flights the next morning and a room at a hotel. Still, no proper arrangements were made to transport us to the hotel and every 4 passengers and all their baggage were dumped in a tiny midsize sedan to be taken to the hotel with multiple trips. There was more mix-up the next morning - Jet Airways said the bookings made by the Etihad guy were not confirmed, and refused to commit to us our flight timings. Thankfully, my flight had two vacant seats, one of which was given to me at the last minute. I ran to the boarding gate just as the final boarding call got concluded. Etihad made a simple long haul travel a real nightmare. Never again with them, ever."

It seems Etihad Airways hire young people who are not very patient or graceful with the wide array of nationalities and personalities they would deal with. On several occasions I saw young flight stewards tell customers to wait their turn, or be patient in a manner that was unnecessarily gruff and rude. One even put her hand up to a man's face when he aimed to clarify how many vegetarian meals his family had ordered. You would have thought he had directly insulted her. The staff seem a bit on edge and do the minimum in the department of friendly service. I must say how unacceptable it is that they serve warm drinks with no ice available, including hard liquor. People were getting hot sodas, and uniced straight whiskey. Why is there no ice? This is ridiculous. It was like this to and from Asia from North America. It seems to be a planned thing. Never order 'vegetarian' meals, they are the most flavorless, fatless meals ever. They believe vegetarian means 'vegan' and they gave me a meal of a bunch of pasta balls with a boring dry minimal tomato sauce and a bean salad that looked beautiful but was not fully cooked. I should have ordered ""Asian Vegetarian"" which would included cheese. On one flight that was only partially filled, the staff were kind enough to find an Asian vegetarian meal to replace the very bland tasteless 'vegetarian' (but really bland vegan) meal and that meal was delicious. They had no tv shows that weren't fiction dramas - I would have liked some talk shows or news shows to learn about current events in different countries. Curt staff that don't know how to gracefully handle people who deserve a lot of respect, a lack of ice, and terrible vegan meals makes me rate the airline a bit lower than many other airlines I have flown with to get overseas."

It was the most harrowing experience with Etihad Airways which did not bother to help us in anyway either with our stay in Bangalore or our transfer to Chennai..

Sleeper suits comfy and as this was a night flight, bed was made up and got 3 hours sleep. Arrived on time. Overall a pleasent experience, and grateful for the upgrade but I found the ground staff and air crews are loosing their touch, they appeared disorganized, unable to communicate, smiling was not in the guide book and lacked any sense of service training.

If you are in last group of boarding your hand luggage will be given to the cargo with main luggage and they gonna say you that there is no enough space because it's a small aircraft.

One cabin crew member was clearly experienced whilst the other three in the cabin were clearly too inexperienced to work in the business class section. I also cannot work out why Etihad only had four Arabic Mezze's onboard when the flight had 22 business class passengers onboard. The other choice was soup that most passengers rejected. Seventy percent of the meals were served by the more experienced crew member due to the other three crew members not really having either the energy or enthusiasm to carry out this particular task. The seating arrangement is tight due to a lot of wasted plastic in the cabin. The flight from Abu Dhabi to Bangkok started in a scrum like manner due to the Ground Crew not adhering to their announcement that certain seat numbers would be boarded accordingly. On board again a bit chaotic this time the right hand side of the cabin was working well whilst the left hand side was non-existent. Again the more experienced members on the right had to help the left side out that were again clearly lacking in experience. The seats designated for couples on 777-300 I would avoid due to both plastic sides restricting your movement, I would choose the outside ones even if you get bumped from time to time. In conclusion this is an airline that needs to urgently recruit experienced Managers who can at least direct their crew accordingly otherwise they will struggle to find customers in this difficult market."

The flight from Bangkok was on a Jet Airways wet leased arrangement. The seating arrangement was not ideal and the continual neon light flashing underneath my table tray disrupted my sleep. The service onboard was very poor. The cabin crew even managed to forgot my drink and meal so I ended up with just a hard sandwich, in the end, due to a shortage of meals onboard. Cabin crew did apologise for their lack of service due to being understaffed. Abu Dhabi to Amsterdam you would have thought you were on a different airline. The Manager onboard made sure her crew provided a seamless business class service. The food was prepared to perfection and laid out exquisitely.  The seat was fine albeit a little bit tight. So for the first flight I would have awarded Etihad Airways 1 and the second 10, hence my difficulty in scoring in this case."

Check-in at Düsseldorf and Melbourne was professional and managed very well. The staff had a friendly approach. We were asked over to the First Class check-in desk as this was not being used at the time. Boarding was carried out in a logical order and special attention paid to families with children and disabled travellers.  We were greeted by friendly and helpful staff. Stowing hand luggage was quick. Service was the best I have experienced. Menus provided after take-off, which offered a vegetarian, meat or fish option. All meals were substantial and delicious. I liked the couscous salads and stainless steel cutlery. I was pleased to see water provided by the cabin crew before take-off. When the drinks service slowed down there was water available at the rear of the plane.  Comfort levels were good by economy standards.  I managed about 3 to 4 hours of sleep on the return journey, which is good by my standards. I found the plane a little bit too cold on the DUS to AUH flight, so I'd advise other travellers to take a good sweater. However, a blanket is provided should you get too cold. Eye masks, headphones toothbrush and toothpaste are provided. A good selection of entertainment. "

Not what was expected from (as we were reminded via the PA several times each flight!) 6 times airline of the year. Steward on Manchester to Abu Dhabi leg with no eye contact, no interaction, no chance of a smile - he only spoke to inform that drinks were restricted due to the flight being full and no ice or lemon available. Flight from Abu Dhabi to Bangkok okay, more for the fact that it was half full and crew able to cope due to less demands rather than providing good service. Bangkok to Abu Dhabi was a full flight and a return to poor service and shortages of refreshments - informed they had run out of water, orange juice, apple juice, ice and lemon. Had a problem with the seat back display but after several attempts to get it resolved I decided to spend the entire journey without it. Final flight Abu Dhabi to Manchester only half full and as it was an overnight, the crew had minimal demands on them so able to cope. I normally opt for Qatar Airways or Emirates, who have never provided a service this bad, and I will avoid flying with Etihad in future. Airline of the year 6 times running - don't make me laugh."

Initially as a young and still growing airline it was understandable that there would be staff training issues and indeed they did improve over time. Not having flown on Etihad Airways for some time I was very disappointed and annoyed with the service - or rather lack of service on my recent flight. My husband was seated in the same row and I watched as he was greeted, offered a drink towel etc whilst service remained notable in my aisle only by its absence. Oddly the gentleman sitting across from me received the same level of service as my husband! Drinks towels nuts, more drink! Order for snack was taken and I placed my breakfast order. Food was below average standard. Drink was refilled by male steward from opposite aisle who seemed to be popping across to lend a hand. Morning arrived and I awake to the sound of food being served so I sat up and got ready to receive my food. Again I watched as my husband who's not ordered food awoke and placed an order which arrived in under 10 minutes. And still I waited as people around me were served but it felt like I was once again wearing my invisibility cloak. Finally in exasperation my husband called the steward who seemed to be in charge and asked if she could find out what had happened to my food. She went off and then came to explain that they had an inexperienced staff and apologised for the delay. She returned with my food shortly afterwards. It was as bad as the night before's offering. The female steward responsible for not bothering to offer me any service did come to apologise claiming that she'd misunderstood. I do not like complaining but this level of service is not acceptable. It is not my problem Etihad Airways staff are inexperienced. One would assume that they should receive the correct training before letting them loose on the paying public. And why did the man across from me get such attentive service when I was bypassed time and again until I had to voice a complaint? Does anyone bother to read these comments? Are Etihad Airways not interested or concerned that there are so many negative comments on here?"

Subsequently I have been in contact with Etihad Airways to ask how to redeem air miles. I was told to set up an account in my name and apply to the Retro Claims Department to have the air miles credited to my account. It transpires that Etihad misinformed me and I should of set up a family account. However due to the delay in Etihad responding to my telephone calls and emails, it is now too late to set up a family account and have the air miles credited. Etihad have been extremely obstructive and very unhelpful with this matter. Etihad staff members don't even read the email trail before they reply; if they did they wouldn't be asking the obvious questions they do. Surely good customer service would be to apologise for the delay, open us a family account and credit the air miles. We will be purchasing five more return flights from Melbourne to Manchester England in 2016. We would never fly with Etihad again. The very average food and average inflight service was a deterrent but the poor customer service is the final straw and will not see us return to Etihad. I would not recommend Etihad to anyone."

Despite all the hype around Etihad being one of the top-tier Gulf carriers, I was surprised to find it to be woefully lacking on this short sector of 1h 55m. There was no drinks service at all in economy. This meant that two hapless flight attendants were asked randomly by passengers for drinks. It was hard for them to remember who asked for what and where they were sitting. Why not just bring the trolley down the aisle and do a drink service so that everyone has something and it isn’t random chaos? Say what you want about the deplorable service on US and Canadian carriers, but at least they do a drink run, even on short flights on small commuter planes. Abu Dhabi is a terrible airport with almost all flights parked remotely and passengers shuttled around in buses."

Last year I arrived late at Abu Dhabi from LHR to be greeted by staff telling me (at 2300) that I had been moved from my connecting flight (for which I had tickets) onto an alternative flight 5 hours later. This was after having several assurances by the onboard staff that my connection would be fine.

First flight (MAN-AUH) I asked at checkin if we could have exit seats as me and my travel partner both stand over 6ft tall. Was told this was not possible unless we paid an additional £75 per flight. I expect low cost airlines to charge for exit seats, not a premium airline. Boarded the plane (A340-600) which has a 2-4-2 seat configuration. Decent seat pitch but minimal legroom. Our steward for this 7 hour flight had an appalling attitude, sulked and even refused to give us a full can of tonic water to share as the flight was full. Passenger in front of me full reclined for the full flight even when dinner was served, wasn't asked to put her seat up once. Later overheard him telling another passenger he had been bumped from a flight to the Seychelles, thus the reason for his mood. Only received one drink during this flight. Second flight (AUH-BKK) on Boeing 777-300, no real issues. Staff were friendly and courteous. Multiple drinks runs. Worth noting that this plane was half full. Seat pitch noticeably poorer with a 3-4-3 config but we were lucky that the seat between us was empty. Returning (BKK-AUH) was when the real problems started. Full flight on an A340-600. Plane was 45 minutes late leaving due to refuelling. This wouldn't have been an issue had the following 18 hours not been so spectacularly bad. Screen in front of me was omitting no sound whatsoever with my headphones or my travel partners. Made the stewardess aware of this and she said she would reset the system. 45 minutes pass and still nothing. I asked again if she would reset it and was told she had already. The screen didn't switch off once, so its impossible this had been reset. Sat for full 7 hours with no inflight entertainment. Drinks came round and again, massive shortages. Was restricted to 1 Gin and 1 Beer each. Asked for ice with my Gin and witnessed the stewardess scratching around the tub for tiny shards of ice. They had none. There was another drinks run later in the flight, if you liked tea, coffee or mango juice. They had run out of everything, including water. No water on a flight with 300 people on board. Last flight after a 4-5 hour layover in AUH was to Manchester. Flight left half full again, on a Boeing 777-300 on overnight flight. My plan was to sleep most of the journey. I went to sleep around 90 minutes into the flight, with my seatbelt on as not to be disturbed clearly visible. I was awoken maybe half an hour later by the stewardess who jabbed her finger into my chest multiple times asking me if I had my seatbelt on (lights had come on). I looked down and saw it was clearly visible and fastened. She scuttled off down the aisle embarrassed. Meanwhile my travel partner next to me is sat there asleep with no seatbelt on! We were left well alone after this and I was allowed to sleep. A completely embarrassing performance highlighted when I sent a tweet to Etihad asking if they wanted my feedback for my recent flight. They immediately blocked me. Truly pathetic. Spend the extra money and fly Emirates, Qatar or Turkish. If Etihad flights are full they are a dreadful consumer experience, worst I've ever endured."

This is the first time flying with Etihad and I relied on their advertising, showing how many awards won, airline of the year etc. On that basis I assumed they would be on a par with other Middle East Airlines (Qatar, Emirates) who I have flown and found very acceptable, especially Qatar. I can honestly say this is the worst overall experience I have had. From this 1 flight I have written to their customer service to report 3 very different incidents, I have not received 1 response! (except automated reply stating I would receive a follow up from representative, we value you as a customer blah blah). The one simple issue to illustrate how poor they are is they have not credited my air miles (including an offer of 5000 miles to compensate a cancelled flight!) for these flights, I have written to them 3 times and received no response - this appears to be their normal procedure judging from other reviews. Obviously not receiving air miles would not constitute a bad experience on its own, but this was just to illustrate just how little they care. The crew are dysfunctional, they do not operate at all as a team. Their service is sloppy and carefree and not at all professional. The food is dreadful, tiny portions and uninspiring, I get much better food and choice on my local budget airline, Air Asia. I am not tall by any stretch of the imagination and the seat squab only came half way up my thigh on A380, the other aircraft (not sure - A340?) was at least normal in this respect. They boast about the suites on the A380 and I guess this is solely to satisfy their mega rich local customers - when it comes to economy they really don't care. Ground service and the way a cancelled flight was dealt with wasn't any better, updates were not the truth, it seemed staff were disorganised even though there were a lot of them, vouchers and information about breakfasts seemed to be handed out on a 1 by 1 basis and not told to everyone."

D Saksena",A380 / A321,19th November 2015,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,LHR to DEL via AUH,August 2015,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2,no,2,"London Heathrow to Abu Dhabi. The A380 was great, but that was all that was impressive about this flight. The plane being new and cutting edge, sold itself. The service was at best, mediocre and the cabin crew showed their lack of experience in confusion and getting mixed up. With a ‘light’ flight, there seemed more a gossip and snacking culture rather than a commitment to looking after their ‘guests’. I had pre-ordered AVML, but was told I should have the veg pasta on the menu, which I did. Then they discovered that the AVML was in the oven, so I agreed to try it out. The AVML was awful! It was as bad as a hospital meal, bland, tasteless, half cooked and not at all AVML. More like kosher or post recuperation food served by nursing staff. The crew apologised for not having AUH landing cards on board – another example of Etihad Airways lack of organisation. Had it been a full flight, I am sure utter mix ups and confusion would have prevailed. The cabin crew did the minimum work and apart from the ambience of the new A380, this one really felt like a budget airline flight. Abu Dhabi to Delhi was a one-off experience! Long queues prevailed at the gate as staff was not able to handle the various combinations of passports, visas and baggage. The process was extremely slow with officials running around, and when we were bundled off the buses onto the aircraft, a compact A320, the cabin crew were not able to handle the seating of passengers, who were allowed to freely roam, change seats, bunch together, shout across the aisles at each other – in chaos. The cleanliness of the aircraft also left something to be desired as one could clearly see grease on windows and unprepared seat pockets (litter in torn literature, left over chewing gum etc.). My seat cushion kept on slipping away forwards, coming off the seat frame. Its Velcro had seen better days. The cover on the seat cushion also came off – a thoroughly uncomfortable situation throughout the flight. Once airborne, Etihad chose to serve dinner. The choice is clearly yours, but at 3:30am (AUH) (4:30am DEL), would it not have been better to have served a substantial snack or a light breakfast rather than dinner, serving which was an ordeal for all in cramped cabin space on this plane. My meal was once again comic. The Serbian hostess told me that they had run out of the veg option, so she ‘could offer me lamb or chicken’. She obviously had no idea! What was the point proudly distributing the menu? I was served flat Coca Cola out of the last remains of a bottle of Coke and she insisted it was ‘fresh’ and not ‘flat’ as it sure was. When I said that I had pre-ordered AVML, she said that might be in the front galley. When the trolley service finished ten minutes later, I was half way through rice salad, bread and Coke, the ‘special’ meal arrived. It was OVML and had clearly been opened previously – I thought it may have even been from another discarded tray! The most uninviting chow mein in it was clearly not my request. Putting Serbian and Swahili speaking staff on a AUH-DEL flight where passengers are likely to be 90% Indian, puts unnecessary stress on the crew despite their brave ‘plastic smiles’, and doesn’t help anyone on the flight.

Undoubtedly the worst ever check-in I have experienced anywhere in the world. Due to some technical issue relating to the check-in computers which was not conveyed to the passengers, it took 4.5 hours to check everyone in; the check-in procedure required pushing, shoving, shouting and general aggravation as no barriers were erected to facilitate fair queueing. I have never in my life watch passengers carrying their baggage over their head, barge to the front of the queue, shout, get angry and then achieve their desire in such an outrageous way. To see the Etihad staff shout and abuse some passengers was also totally unacceptable; quite clearly they could not cope. I was virtually the last person on the plane which was delayed for 2.5 hours and as such missed my onward connection in Abu Dhabi resulting in a 9 hour stay at the Airport Premier Inn and missing my first night in my Bangkok Hotel for which I paid around USD100 which has still not been reimbursed. The customer service has been dreadful since my emails and forms to the Etihad system were ignored. Eventually I received 20,000 air miles after writing to the boss and an apology. 20,000 airmiles are not the same as flying 20,000 miles in the air mind you. I have made some enquiries and believe I will receive a small discount if I fly this route with them again; I also receive junk mail from Etihad Airways now as well which I don't like. The flights themselves were okay but the seats are too narrow and the leg room is poor. IFE is okay but not as good as other middle-eastern carriers - too many US English films."

Left Frankfurt late and due to a short connection I was informed by the crew that they rebooked me on EY 406. Friendly crew on EY2 and the dinner I chose was one of the best economy dishes I ever had. Seat was ok for me (21H) - as comfortable or unconfortable as other economy seats. Upon arrival in Abu Dhabi I was met by EY staff at the gate and given my new ticket to EY 406 incl an upgrade to business class. Time loss was about 2 hours which did not bother me to much because I would have not been able to check in my hotel room anyways. Original arrival 6:35 am arrived 9:05 am. Crew and food were good on this flight.  Arrival in Bangkok - well my luggage was lost. That made me a little angry. First they knew on the first leg that I would not make my connection - they have the luggage tag numbers and did not manage to get the luggage to 406 in time although there was about 2 hours of transfer time. I think that was poor service. It was after midnight when my suitcase showed finally up in Pattaya.

There was chaos in Abu Dhabi. Since US immigration is cleared in AUH, I was told to go to the gate 2 hrs prior and assured that the lounge next to gate is comparable to the main Etihad Airways lounge. This was a lie. The lounge near the gate (you can't exit and return to the big lounge) is pathetic. Hardly enough seating, no smoking area, no alcoholic drinks and not enough snacks. The onboard service was bad to say the least. No night suit was given. When I asked for it, they give it after two reminders, and one crew told me they were under instructions not to give it out unless pressed for. Drinks were never refilled without asking and then done grudgingly. An old aircraft that was falling apart - eg. no holder for soap so the entire flight the soap was dripping on the counter. There was no water in one bathroom and instead of shutting it down, the crew handed me a bottle of water for use in there! Food was poor (special meal Asian Veg) and looked similar to budget airline paid meal."

My daughter, a size 12, managed to squeeze into the seat. I'm an 18 and so not comfortable. Food and service poor. Half a cup of tea/wine, then staff went, never to return. The same meal on both flights. On the return trip, we paid extra to sit in exit seats. Not happy to find most of them empty, and the man sat next to me, had just moved himself up from a seat at the back!  The one upside, was the man at Athens Airport, who arranged my upgrade, was wonderful, and the lady he sent me to see to pay for my upgrade was also brilliant.  I have done a lot of long haul flights, and I can honestly say the plane and the service were the worst I have had. "

Another negative is the bus trips between the gate and plane in Abu Dhabi is terribly hot and crowded and no bus for business class - they just squeeze as many as possible in the busses.

I was sitting in seat 69K alongside my partner. The aircraft appeared fully booked. There was a problem in zone 4 where I was sat whereby it appeared a family consisting of mother, father and 3 small children did not have their seats together and mum was pleading with the flight attendant to sort this out. The male attendant was doing his best however, on the arrival of the senior flight attendant who spoke to all of the passengers in the area and said, ""can we all work together to sort this out. I'm looking for two passengers to move seats to accommodate the family"". When a passenger asked if there would be an upgrade, she said, ""No - on the same economy class"". No one appeared to offer at this stage, so she then became quite hostile and then said, ""Ok if no-one is prepared to move, then the flight will be delayed"" and she walked away from the whole situation. I was appalled by her behaviour. It was as if she was a child having a tantrum. I believe that this problem should have been sorted out by the staff from Etihad and not speak to the passengers in the manner in which she did. There was also an other flight attendant throughout the journey who served food in the aisle which I was sitting, this flight attendant demanded, rather than ask, that the blinds be lowered. Not what I would expect from flight attendants. The food was mediocre. Inflight entertainment was not great as there were not many new films - a lot of older films. Once we reached Heathrow, it took an eternity for the stairs to be attached to the aircraft and it took at least twenty minutes for passengers to alight from the aircraft. I would not travel with Etihad Airways again."

I flew round trip AUH-DUB-AUH and the subpar experience started from Abu Dhabi Airport, the fact that most of the airport is still under major renovation and construction alone does not justify the cost of the ticket Etihad charges. Let's start with check-in, the online check in can only be done via website as there is no app that would do it for you (EK or QR have great apps, for example), therefore, there is no such a thing as an online boarding pass integrated into the passbook of the phone. Here are the positive points about the ground service at AUH: Escort service could be provided to sort out the documents and immigration. The Premium Lounge is indeed very nice, albeit not many options for the buffet. Negatives about the ground service at AUH: Being bussed to the aircraft is not luxurious however you try to market it. The Airport is just horrendous The in-flight experience AUH-DUB: Lovely food, I loved the option of eating whenever I chose to. Lovely options for beverages. Crew could be hit or miss. On both legs of my journey, some crew were nice and others were not so great. One of the crew even went as far as to lie: ""Captain just informed me we were above Ankara."" I later found out we never got close to Turkey, which left me puzzled. The reason I had this conversation in the first place was the fact that E-BOX did not work properly and had no flight information. Ground services at DUB: The check in was the same as in AUH. Nothing great. The Airport is wonderful and a joy to go through. The lounge was wonderful too. Great ambience, quiet with attentive staff. In-flight experience DUB-AUH: One word, horrible. No drink was offered to me and my colleague simply because the crew never passed by our side of the cabin. Amenity kit was used by someone else, and I had to ask for a new one. I had to ask for my glass of champagne 3 times, which thankfully arrived 30 minutes after take off. Some meals were not available. I was not asked when I would like to have my food, nor was I asked for my preference of drinks. The food arrived with still water (not ordered by me), the wine I had asked for was not served either. When I asked for sparkling water, the guy just poured some into my half empty glass of still water. No questions asked. Cheese selections consisted of one type of cheese decorated with fruits and berries. The name should be changed to ""Fruit section with added cheese"" The overall feel was as if I had to beg for the service that is supposed to be provided. The cabin had also not been cleaned well as I found a crushed dry bread loaf under my seat, which thoroughly covered the floor under my feet for the remainder of the flight. Overall, I would not recommend flying Business Class with Etihad as it is simply not worth the money. From the moment you book the ticket, you are in for a ride.The most thing I liked about my experience was the consistent and high-speed internet connection that is reasonably priced."

My two favorite aspects of flying Etihad Business: 1) Personal Food and Beverage Manager. 2) Lie-Flat bed. The food is ""restaurant-quality"", and you can order anything from the menu at any time. The cabin service on all routes was excellent. In A340-600 and A330-200, there was no overhead compartment in Business Class to stow luggage for passengers in the middle seats (B777-200 doesn't have this problem). The wi-fi on Etihad works like a charm. Etihad's Business Lounge in Abu Dhabi has something for everyone when it comes to dining. Having said that, the operations at Etihad's Abu Dhabi terminal are far from perfect for transit passengers. So, if you can look past the hiccups at Abu Dhabi Airport, flying Etihad Business Class is a special experience."

Maybe? I know I sound like a snob (I guess I am one) but I do think that kids should be at the back of the plane. If I pay a premium for a seat I think I'm entitled to an overall better service. I was detained coming out of UAE as there was a problem with my passport. Etihad ground crew had updated my itinerary with my UK passport which showed I didn't have right of entry to Australia. I have 2 passports. Let me tell you I did have 15 mins of worry - unnecessarily. They need to sharpen up their act. it's the attention to detail that counts and that was just sadly lacking.

From Abu Dhabi to Manila, I was upgraded (paying a very logical amount) to business class. Business class lounge was very convenient, clean, and the food was really nice with a lot of choices. Onboard my the cabin staff serving me was very polite but I had the feeling that he did not understand me well when I ask for something. Food was not in business class level, plus he forgot to serve me the main course dish (tenderloin beef). When realize that was too late. Etihad need to make more improvements, competition is very hard."

Tried ringing Virgin Australia as it was a codeshare but they were unable to help or call Abu Dhabi, but did give me a number to ring.  On the Abu Dhabi Athens leg were told the bar had closed when trying to order a ginger beer, but noticed drinks continued to be delivered to other passengers?

Inflight entertainment was average. Seats were cramped and uncomfortable for a long haul flight. Ground service at New Delhi airport was terrible. They missed the one bag I checked in. Understaffed ground service crew took 90 minutes to finally document a missing bag report before I could leave. There were no follow up calls, it was impossible to get through every time I called. Finally got it 3 days after landing but the ground staff were poorly trained and highly unprofessional. Overall I would say Emirates is better in every respect. Etihad is cheaper but you get what you pay for."

Athens to Abu Dhabi was great, smooth check in and we were given the emergency exit row seats. The meals were tasty. We had an 8 hour stop over in Abu Dhabi and was not happy with the service there. Before we had gotten on the plane they searched our bags and made us throw all liquid out (even though we had already done this in customs). This meant entering the flight without anything to drink. For a 14 hour flight I like to stay hydrated so this was extremely frustrating. After take off I asked for a bottle of water. I was told I couldn't have one, I could only have a plastic cup that they filled a quarter of the way with water. Apart from our drinks with meals this was all we got. I rang the service bell and waited 1/2 an hour and got no reply even after pressing twice. I had to walk down the other end of the plane just to get another tiny cup of water. For 14 hours on a plane this is ridiculous and for the amount of money you pay for a ticket I would think you could at least be given adequate amounts of water. The flight went smoothly, although meals were rushed towards the end of the flight (don't know why though we had 14 hours to prepare for them) it was a fine, yet uncomfortable journey."

And-to my utter surprise, they did it again. They completely messed it up. Hard to believe, but they did. It reminded me of last year when my wife was booked on the exactly same flight out of Narita and arrived 3 days after the scheduled arrival date in Dusseldorf. This time, during check-in my wife was told nonchalantly by the Narita Etihad Airways ground staff that although her flight data is stored in the Etihad system it cannot be found in the Air Berlin system. In other words: they will not let her take that plane for the simple reason that the link between the Air Berlin system and the Etihad system is missing. One of the staff told her that this sometimes happens and that she should call Air Berlin. What, are you kidding me? Anyway she called them and the Air Berlin call center staff told her that everything is fine and that maybe she checked in too early.  Well it wasn’t ok and the Etihad Airways ground staff continued refusing to hand out a boarding ticket. Maybe one day I will write a book about what a lousy company Etihad is (if anybody hasn’t noticed yet). My wife had to listen to their Narita ground staff and later she was issued a temporary Ticket and had the privilege to board the plane for which I had already paid, after they let her wait for three hours. Last time when this happened I thought they are just a bunch of losers, but by now I think they are either completely incapable or they are doing this intentionally. Later my wife was told that she will have to check that the return flight on Saturday 10th is correctly listed in the Etihad Airways / Air Berlin system otherwise she will not be able to fly home."

The service was excellent, crew were attentive and friendly, the Bloody Mary was made with Tabasco and Worcester. The dinner was okay, though the chicken rendang had run out and only the fish and vegetarian noodles were available. Who would have thought, that the chicken would be more popular than the fish? Seat was comfortable, the inflight entertainment had a decent variety of shows. It's a decent airline, and they fly A380s. Abu Dhabi is a bit dated, but looks like a new terminal is appearing.

Please be aware of this.  I did not know and purchased a return flight from SIN-JFK and spent $1600 on a flight expecting to have excellent service and aircraft but was extremely disappointed. I only found out that I was flying a Jet Airways aircraft when I boarded the plane and would not have purchased this flight if I knew. The plane was dirty and old, it looked like it was from 1970 and had horrible red carpeting and old seats. The food was terrible too. It was Indian food, which I dont mind, but I had no idea what was on the menu. Even the steward did not know what it was. What was most upsetting is that Etihad Airways claims that it is an Etihad Airways aircraft. Everything, from the check in counter, to the boarding pass to some of the stewards are Etihad Airways, so they claim it is an Etihad Airways flight, which is not so. I would not have minded as much if they were clear and transparent that I would be flying a Jet Airways plane. I feel cheated and that's why I am writing a review. If you are flying the EY100 do not take it.  Please make sure that you check with the airline before you book your flights as Etihad Airways is not explicit about what aircraft you will be taking. You dont want to be in for a bad surprise on a 14 hour flight."

My daughter had it on her blanket which saved her clothes, the armrest and seat she was sitting in. The smell was horrible. We rang for the stewardess from 3 different places and no one showed until the gentleman in front of us went to get someone. A stewardess came and tried to clean it up but she too was getting sick, so she said I will put a blanket over the seat and then you can sit. We refused to sit on vomit. She told me to go find another seat. I looked but most of the plane was asleep and you could not see where there were any empty seats. I told her people were asleep and she said ""wake them up"". I said no, you wake them up it is your job. This was a very special trip my daughter and I, planned as we never had the opportunity to do a mother daughter trip before.

Before booking my flight to Hong Kong from Manchester (with a 2 hour stop over in Abu Dhabi), I researched Etihad Airways on here and I was surprised by the luke-warm and even negative, response. But having travelled with them, they are understandable reviews. Leaving Manchester, the aircraft was late boarding, and late taking off - due to the fact that the plane arrived later from its previous journey. It was a farce when queuing. Most airlines wait for clear space before allowing you to go through the gate, down the ramp and enter the aircraft. Etihad, however, started checking boarding passes well before the aircraft was ready, meaning we had a 25 minutes wait inside the airplane access ramp, waiting while the stewardesses finished off their preparations and loaded the disabled passengers. Perhaps we could have waited in the lounge? On the flight, those at the back of the cabin soon found that they ran out of food options - the chicken was the first to go. That said it was the best airline food I have had.  Seat room was limited for a tall guy like myself, but not too restrictive. However, when people in from of you recline your seats, you have no other option but to do the same yourself, such is the lack of space. Most of the films are not new, and there is a limited range of choices. With the Milan fashion week coming up at the time of departure, the airline (a sponsor) had presented the in-flight entertainment along the theme of fashion. Most films were based around that theme. I would prefer just a bunch of movies where I can control the theme of what I watch. Finding your way around Abu Dhabi Airport is fairly straightforward, clearly laid out and information desks if you get stuck. From Abu Dhabi to Hong Kong, there was not much support for the Chinese speaking passengers on the flight. The menu,and the entertainment system, was in English or Arabic, with little for Chinese. In the end, being a basic speaker myself, I ended up translating the menu for a group of around 25 Chinese people. I would not call Etihad a 'top airline' as they claim, especially not for Economy travellers, where airlines like Virgin and Cathay Pacific do a better job on the same route. However, it was not my worst flight ever. I would recommend this airline for the food (if they have the options when you get it), as I thoroughly enjoyed it."

I told them I hadn't, and after 20 minutes of grumbling between check in staff, I was allocated a seat that they told me was an emergency exit seat. When I boarded the plane it turned out that I'd been given a middle aisle seat, despite there being empty emergency exit seats. On transfer in Abu Dhabi to the new plane it turned out I had again been allocated a middle seat between the window and the aisle. This seat is by far the most uncomfortable long haul economy seat I've ever had the displeasure of sitting in! Incredibly narrow, even for me (I am not a wide guy!), and with shocking legroom. When the passenger in front of me moved their seat back I literally couldn't move! On the positive side, the staff were friendly on my flight, and meals were adequate.

The aircraft on the Delhi to Abu Dhabi sector had newer and better business class seats than the Abu Dhabi to LAX sector. Flight was delayed taking off from Delhi and again leaving for Los Angeles from Abu Dhabi. On the second leg of my journey (which was 16.5 hrs), they only had one assigned meal and the rest were optional (which meant, order whenever required). While taking our order, the cabin staff mentioned that they had run out of the chicken option. When I enquired about how that could be possible since I was the in the second cabin (the one after first class), they simply stated that they start taking order from the back of the plane and hence they ran out. I thought this was a one off and didn't really care at the time. Later during the flight, when I tried to order something from their round-the-clock menu, they mentioned that they had run out of everything besides the baklava. It was kind of ridiculous that they expected passengers to eat only one meal during a 16.5 hr flight! On my return journey, I had the same experience. Flight delayed - after getting on the flight, they said they had run out of the mezze platter which is served as a starter. Later again, their round-the-clock menu didnt have enough to keep me (or others for that matter) satisfied. The second leg from Abu Dhabi to Delhi initially had a 2 hour gap but due to the flight getting delayed, this was reduced to about 45 minutes. Had to really hurry in order to catch the flight even without the unhelpful nature of Etihad staff on the plane and their ground staff. No one was ready to guide us through the waiting lines early for us to make it. They simply just shrugged it off. Further, after asking them repeatedly, they didn't hand out landing cards, which are required to be filled out and handed over to immigration at the Delhi. Right before landing, they made an announcement that they didn't have the cards but that their ground staff would have them as soon as we arrive at New Delhi. There was no one from Etihad Airways handing them out and the whole plane had to manage to find the cards and fill them out before finally getting into line at 03.30! Overall, regardless of their lower price than competitors (Emirates etc), I would not recommend flying Etihad again."

The check in process went ok, when it came to boarding we were late boarding and late leaving - pilot did say it was to do with traffic at Manchester but if you check this flight daily it does not often leave on time think it is due to the fact the plane has come in that morning about an hour earlier, not enough time to get passengers off and plane cleaned. When it came to the food there was three options for main choice, but by the time the stewardess got to us there was only one choice left. The seat space was tight. On our return journey the initial check in was great - but then it all turned into a mess, as we got called to the gate and had to stand in a long line and queue to have our passports checked, various hand luggage was also been checked here. Why is this not done at security? Once we got our passports checked we were then stood in the gate area which was filling up fast, people all stood in front of the glass doors - when boarding then started they called for passengers in zone 3 and we had to fight our way through the crowds to board the plane. The food came round and once again they had run out of out the chicken course again - I did not like the other options and the stewardess then said there was some crew meals we could have, so she went away and came back with a meal which she described as a low calorie chicken dish - it turned out to be fish! One dish I do not eat good job I did not have an allergy to fish! I appreciate menu did say if your first choice is not available they apologise, but this happened on flight both ways. Me and my partner then tried to use the headsets both of these did not work.  Overall we were fairly disappointed with Etihad Airways - they advertise they are a top airline, but not to us!"

Well the trouble started here when the passengers who were to travel to the US were asked to go to US Immigration Services Counter. You pass through a maze of gates and when you reach the desired gate, you see a waiting area of people which should have given me some hint. They had collected our boarding passes and were calling out names as and when our luggage was transferred. Chaos to the core and added to it is the fact that if you don't get a seat to sit, you end upstanding like me and a few others for almost 45 minutes. Finally you get the boarding pass and clear security and rush down to the US immigration counter where again after a long wait you finally get to the gate. Boarded the flight, unfortunately, after the flight took off was when I realised that no amount of pushing gets my seat to recline. After a while, looking around I realized that a lot of seats had to be manually pushed to recline by the stewardess. When I checked with one of them, she said that I can move to any other empty seat in the coach but I couldn't find an empty one that reclined. I was so glad when we landed at O'Hare - after 15 hours of sitting upright in a seat without reclining what can you expect. The IFE was good and food was hot and tasty. "

When I arrived in Abu Dhabi I understood. Etihad Airways flight was delayed for 3 hours - and 3 hours which I spent trying to get a boarding pass. Finally, they sent me to the boarding gate, I had to run as it was on the other side of the airport to get a boarding pass. Ground staff were very unhelpful. Flight and cabin crew were pleasant. Furthermore, my bag arrived one day later. Based on this experience, I can't recommend this airline."

The chauffeur drive was nice, check in very fast. The lounge was poor and not really worth waiting in but onboard things improved. Very attentive crew, comfortable, older style seats, wine good. My special meal was not on board but they found food for me and gave a letter of apology on landing and air miles as compensation. Food was okay but not the best in the sky.  "

New flat beds close to the most comfortable I have flown. Crew were superb. Had an over two hour delay at the gate after the doors had closed due to congestion over Muscat but this was handled well and we watched a movie and had a drink. Can choose time of dining. The food was pretty good and very well presented but at times didn't work (herbed potato panacotta didn't work). Comfort of Boeing 787 superb. WiFi was free in Business. One of the best business class flights I have had in terms of service.

The check-in process in Dublin went smoothly, staff on both legs of my flight were superb, food was good by airplane standards, the inflight entertainment was decent and I had a lot more legroom than I'm used to. The only downfall was that my screen froze, because I was pressing buttons during an announcement. But I rather wanted to sleep, anyway. I fly frequently (usually American Airlines, US Airways, AirAsia, or Ryanair), and Etihad service was better quality overall.  I'm not saying the service couldn't have been bad for some, perhaps these are one-offs. People usually only review when they've had either excellent service or poor service - and more often the latter than the former."

Arrival in Abu Dhabi was chaotic - why the need to go through security after getting off the flight and into transit? The queues were appalling. We'd booked Pearl Assist where they met us and fast-tracked us through lines to the lounge and took us back to the gate for the flight to Athens, really worth it. Bussed out to the plane in the searing heat for the flight to Athens, not a full flight so room to spread out. All flights near enough on time and they didn't lose our luggage!"

DMM-AUH flight delayed by almost 1 hour. Couldn't use lounge, even though I'm a Silver member of Etihad FFP. AUH airport doesn't always use airbridges. and you have to use the bus from plane to terminal. Three security checks for US pre-clearance. Again, couldn't use the lounge after pre-clearance. The only lounge you could use as a silver member is Reem lounge in a different terminal (and that should be done before pre-clearance). Also, the departure area is a bit small, so it can get crowded sometimes. AUH-IAD flight was great. After you land, you just walk out with your luggage. IAD-AUH Silver members were allowed to use IAD lounge, which was amazing. The lounge is newly built and very professional staff. Flight was also great. AUH-DMM was delayed a bit but was great. Overall I would rate my trip as 7/10, but with the lounge access at IAD, I would ramp it to 9/10."

The service was poor and the staff never had a smile on their faces. On the way over we had a choice for dinner - we were a quarter of the way through the aircraft there was no choice and only one option which when served was cold. Every time someone asked for a drink, the bar was closed, and when my husband asked for an apple juice that was forgotten and never arrived. On the way back we were served chicken breast, mashed potatoes and veg at 6.00am in the morning. Totally inappropriate and not enjoyable. This was the first time we had flown Etihad Airways (we normally fly Emirates) and it will certainly be the last time. And we were not the only ones complaining. We were speaking to people at Heathrow who had an even worse opinion about Etihad Airways. The fares were expensive and when we decided to move our flight ahead by about 4 days we were charged an extra $700 - daylight robbery."

I took a flight from Rome to Abu Dhabi in economy class, so I didn't expect anything special, but since this company apparently like to celebrate itself, I expected to be a bit better than regular economy - wrong expectation. The seats were narrow, uncomfortable and worn out. Space for legs was non existent. Service onboard was extremely poor, nobody really cares. My monitor didn't work so I asked the flight attendant if it was possible to sit somewhere else, the answer was ""we will let you know after take off"". Obviously soon after nobody cared any more about my request, and I didn't bother to ask again. I haven't seen a smile from the staff during the flight except for a male flight attendant (the only male), who was trying his best despite the miserable situation in economy. I was very thirsty so  asked for some water and was told to wait for them to pass by with the trolley - a lady asked for the same thing and she received the same answer. We had to wait half an hour.  At the end of the flight before leaving the plane they were in line with their plastic smile they need to have by the contract - apparently this only happens at the end of the flight. I really do not understand how this airline can consider itself a ""leading airline"", the level of professionalism and courtesy onboard is embarassing."

I would call Airport Handling (Etihad’s lost luggage agent at Malpensa airport) and after holding for about 10 minutes an automated voice would say ‘Our representatives are busy on other calls and cannot help you now. Please call back later’. The call would then terminate. It was incredibly frustrating. The only phone number I could find for Etihad was a ticket reservation number which went through to a call centre in Ireland. The representative there told me that he could not assist. The only means of contact I could find to contact Etihad was the complaints forum on its website. After not hearing anything for two weeks, I emailed again, and it seems that Etihad never received my complaint. Apart from one email from Etihad Airways asking when I sent my original complaint, I never heard back from the airline. I have contacted them four times to the prescribed email address, and never heard back. No assistance, apology or proper communication was given by Etihad Airways. The situation was handled appallingly. It ruined our holiday. On our return flight, we had to wait 2 hours in a plane on a runway from Abu Dhabi because ‘some passenger luggage could not be located’.

On March 30th, I had flown from Melbourne with Tigerair and due to a weather related delay I missed my flight with Etihad. The agents that assisted me at Sydney Airport were wonderful. They were sympathetic and understanding and wanted to try and assist so the best possible outcome could occur. I was re-booked straight through to Toronto on April 1st like I wanted, however the agents told me that my booking was in 2 different travel classes and it needed to be uniform for the ticket to be issued in the system. Upon hearing this I went to the Flight Centre store in the international terminal at Sydney Airport since my booking was held with them, and asked their agent to contact the agent that I had worked with in Toronto to see if the booking class could be switched. They along with my Toronto based agent were unable to do so despite trying their hardest. I ended up at the Etihad Airways office in Sydney and they wanted over $2200 to change my booking, and against my wishes put me on a flight to New York City on April 5th. Agents at this Etihad Airways office were rude, unwilling to help and thoroughly unsympathetic. As a result of all this, I ended up missing an important event.

The experience became a little bit better after. Got an express passport check ticket. The lounge was pleasant and service was pretty good. The seat onboard was pretty comfortable. The food was great, lighting soothing and the flight attendants helpful and friendly. It says on the website that you get free access to the internet - you have to pay and it didnt work most of my flight! Abu Dhabi airport was a disaster. Having only 1 hour transit there was no point going to the lounge, so I head straight into my gate. The airport was boiling, crowded and lots of random passport checking before gates. Only 1 person checking the passport for 5 gates. Extremely time consuming and draining after a 14 hours flight. Flight to Kuwait was generic. I am flying Emirates or Qatar Airways next time."

A380 and 777. Have read the criticism of the lie flat seats but I found them fine and quite comfortable. A little bit firmer than other airines and I think no Pyjamas. Food was quite good too. Lounge en-route very good, but busy. Lounge in Heathrow has good service and food as well, the staff there should be commended. Service enroute was efficient. So overall quite good as the schedules are convenient, lounges and food are good, I think the seats/beds are okay too. The bad part of the experience. Ticketing. Booked through a travel agent but had to confirm a change with ticketing in Heathrow as it was after hours for my agent at home. The ticketing agent Heathrow, could not have been less helpful from the start. Firstly ranting about how it is against IATA regulations for her to do anything, how the change would cost 3000 pounds, etc. Luckily my agent made the change in minutes for 100 pounds. Inflight entertainment. Definitely bring your own if you are from a western country. Almost no recent movies or TV shows. Long flights are the only time I get to watch movies in peace, so that was very disappointing. Quite a long line for check-in at heathrow. Business class waited close to 30 minutes for check-in which is unusual. I do understand it is an A380 but there were lots of empty check in counters further along. So overall the inflight entertainment and just a very unpleasant experience with my only contact point being Heathrow ticketing I will probably avoid flying them again. But for the aircraft/lounges/service etc that was no problems at all."

Seating atrocious, ok we were economy and in the row of 4 in the middle of the plane - sardines spring to mind but on a very tight package. Had I not moved my arm from the armrest the trolley would have taken it off thats how tight they are. We visited a flight centre in Adelaide to tranfer seats to the exit doors (which we had to pay exra for). Much better - but - a passenger was ill and vomiting in the toilet, when he was not vomiting he was sat directly in front of us on the air stewards seat, the toilet was not sealed off to other passengers - this passenger alternated between the toilet and the seat for at least 2 hours (the smell was not nice). There were empty seats but another class. On such a long haul flight no one should be so crammed in and so uncomfortable that the experience becomes unpleasant. We did ask to upgrade but the cost was 8,000Euros which to say the least is extortionate bearing in mind what we had already paid and the extra to move seats. So those seats flew empty."

Food was decent, drinks ok. Flight from AUH to VIE was with Flyniki on an A320. No IFE, but seat comfort was actually better than on the B787-9. Food was average, lots of plastic on the tablet.

As we knew there was a 2 hour turn around at Abu Dhabi we were pleased to see that both our suitcases were labelled 'Hot transfer' and Priority. However this was to prove pointless as on awaiting take off from Abu Dhabi we were delayed due to awaiting transfer baggage. On arriving at Male however neither of our cases arrived. We went to the baggage reclaim section in Male where the Etihad staff member was totally disinterested in our problem. She was ineffective, offered no apology or useful information. Having travelled business we expected a far better service - we appreciate that there are high volumes of luggage but at least an apology and regular updates are not too much to ask for. Also once on the plane (A320) my husbands head rest was broken and he has to stand for around half an hour whilst an engineer was called to fix, once on the second part of the flight his foot rest was broken. This was still broken on the return flight. Several requests for food and drink had to be repeated as the drinks/food did not arrive. I cannot eat sea food or poultry and on the return journey both starters contained sea food - so I could not eat either - surely one option should be vegetarian. Overall our experience of Etihad is very poor and on returning to the UK the ease of trying to contact the relevant departments is also very complicated. It appears that Etihad do not have any true form of customer service."

As a last resort, I went to the Supervisor who asked me if I have the Residence Permit number, which I had and everything was fine. Now why didn't the lady at the counter ask me this before off-loading me? So we got in the line again for Check-in and went through the tedious process again and I couldn't believe it when they handed me over the Boarding passes. On the departure gate, all our Hand-carry luggage was weighed again, anybody who bought anything from the Duty-Free shop was in trouble. Etihad Airways may have a good in-flight service , but very lousy ground handling staff.  That the Last time I am traveling on Etihad Airways."

But the flight was two hours delay in take off. Because of this delay I had only 15 mins to catch my next connecting flight to Chennai. The flight was supposed to take off by 9:30 am but it took off by 11:30am. It's supposed to land at Abu Dhabi by 7:40pm but landed at 9:05pm and my next connecting flight was by 9:30pm. After that I managed to reach Chennai. But I was shocked to know that they did not transit my 4 bags that were left in Abu Dhabi. Then they told me to lodge the complaint on missing baggage. After lengthy procedure they agreed to send my baggage in next flight.  All my friends say Etihad Airways is always delayed."

Flight attendants friendly enough. A330 to Perth felt claustrophobic and I think is too small a plane for such a long flight. My baggage did not arrive, (was not a tight connection). Many of the other business class passengers bags did not arrive either. My bag arrived 48 hours later, still with priority tag in place. It obviously served no purpose!

Etihad seriously lacks in a lot of areas. I expected so much more from such a high profile airline. Check-in was the best part as a member of staff noticed I am very tall and sourced an exit row seat for me which I was extremely thankful for as it was a 13hr flight, but the tired Boeing 777 had uncomfortable aged seats and I couldn't wait to land. I selected a non-lactose meal, and it seemed to be half the amount of the regular meal, why is this? I had no bread roll or desert (both didn't contain dairy). On a 13hr flight we were only given two small meals and a snack which was a muffin. I didn't see any attendants for hours in between meals. I only noticed one lot of drinks being bought round, and other customers had to constantly call for drinks and food, and when asked it seemed such a big effort for them. The attendant who served me hardly spoke English, and didn't have a clue what was going on. I asked for a coffee and the cup wasn't even half full. I asked her why, and she said she ran out of coffee! Abu Dhabi airport shops were all high end expensive boutiques, not much opportunities for normal people. Most travelers were swarming the food court and alcohol and tobacco shops, no one was in the expensive ones. Toilets were disgusting! I asked at a transfer desk if there was any way I could get an exit row seat, I was just told ""no, the flight is full"". Unexceptable in my opinion.  It is so uncomfortable and stressful having to sit in a regular seat when you are very tall, it makes the journey a nightmare. The A380 was a nicer plane, but everything else was still terrible - like the first leg. Attendants were rude and unhelpful, they had no sympathy for me being squashed in a normal seat. This was only a 7hr flight but we received more drinks than the 13hr flight? On both flights VOD was awful. I had flown with Etihad a few years ago and it was just the same, but I thought I would try again and see if they had improved due to the new fleet of aircraft, but how wrong I was. Next time I shall fly with Qatar Airways or Singapore Airways. "

While Sydney to Abu Dhabi was good, Abu Dhabi to Dublin was a nightmare. In from of my seat was a mother with two small children who screamed or cried almost all of the 7.5 hours or leaned over the back of the seat to knock things off my table or shout. I returned from Rome where I expected an Etihad Airways flight and decided it would be better in economy because at least screaming children are expected there. We boarded what we thought was an Etihad Airways flight, but found it to be Alitalia.  The food was inedible, the seats were cramped and really uncomfortable and the crew unhelpful. I did not request Alitalia and after that I never will again fly Etihad Airways if they are partnering with them. In Abu Dhabi we again boarded what was supposed to be Etihad Airways, but this time it was Virgin Australia. They were fine. In Abu Dhabi I tried on three occasions to use my frequent flyer points to upgrade to Business class with frustrating results which ultimately failed and we boarded a fully booked flight to Sydney. "

Had been sat in my nice business class seat for less than 2 minutes when the stewardess tipped a full tray of juice all over me! I was soaked! Admittedly it was a stupid passenger that had knocked into her and precipitated the event. However, soaked in sticky juice with another 12 hours of travelling ahead of me was awful. The stewardess was very apologetic and the CSD came to see me and promised all manner of wonderful things when I got to AUH such as the option to shower and fresh clothing being available. Sadly when I got to AUH nothing materialised. I then made my way on my next flight to London having dried out naturally. When I got back to the UK I contacted Etihad's customer service and whilst acknowledging what a poor experience I had endured and whilst espousing how customer service is Etihad's priority, denied my request and offered a partial refund of 10,000 miles - that was the sum total of Etihad's service recovery. Needless to say I have not flown with them since."

Eventually boarding started at 2145hrs. Once most passengers were seated, we heard from the flight deck that there is going to be another 45 minutes delay. The plane is new, barely over one month old. The connector for their (I feel misrepresented) noise-cancelling earphones is rather fancy, almost taking a leaf from Apple's Magsafe2 technology of magnetic connection, not the usual 2 prong. The selection of viewing material quite impressive (not as much as Emirates). One thing which I had great difficulty getting use to most of the flight was the fragrance that they incorporated into the air-conditioning. The staff in Economy cabin were mostly smiling and friendly. They came down the aisle with trays of water during the flight. Food  was a slight let down. I chose the vegetarian option for the late supper, but wasn't that satisfactory. The light ""snack"" they gave before landing was just a bun with I think red bean paste in it? "

The sector BKK-AUH was on a Jet Airways and the sector from AUH to FCO with Alitalia. Zero Etihad experience. BKK-AUH was ok as I slept the trip in Biz class though the configuration of the Jet Airways business class is a bit odd. Everyone is pointing sideways. AUH-FCO operated by Alitalia wasn’t as pleasant. Staff seemed clearly unhappy and stressed out. At the end of a cartoonish safety video that ends with the phrase “your crew is perfectly trained” the Captain announced in English “Cabin staff get ready for landing” as we were still waiting at the foot of the runway for take-off. I had to contact by phone Etihad’s 24 hour help center, besides not being particularly friendly or polite, they didn’t understand the problem I had and finally left me hanging on the phone until the system cut me off. This happened twice. Because the issue surrounded a 6 + 11 hour delay and because the flight originated from Europe where consumer rights state that any flight with a delay greater than 5 hours may be refunded I was able to change carriers and fly back with a different company. Etihad thanks but no thanks, never again."

My next destination was Manila with a 1 hour layover before heading to Hong Kong The flight was late again and once arrived in Manila I found out that in order to catch the next flight I had to go though immigration, go to another terminal (40 min taxi ride) and check in again. The ground staff in Manila told me that this happens all the time and that Etihad does not care about their passengers and their only goal is to send them away from their hub in Abu Dhabi. So I got on a plane 3 hours later and arrived in HK with a 15 hour delay and without my luggage. The company could not locate my luggage. Fortunately, I received it one day later. Etihad Airways customer service is far below average. They did not respond to my email for 10 days now and hang up on the phone twice. Their website is not working at all on a constant basis."

Good service, friendly staff (still South African Airways offers slightly better service and has more leg space). Several hours delay in Abu Dhabi as this airport can clearly not handle high volume of air traffic and passengers. The airport cannot handle the flux of passengers. There is by far not enough seating at the airport, the airport is simply outdated. Flight EY58 - 18 July 2015. A horrible experience. The aircraft seemed to be a loan from Alitalia. One staff member in economy class was simply rude. The seat was sticky with dried food remains, so did the later discovery that the pocket in the seat in front of me was sticky as well. It came clear why when unfolding the table which had food left over and dried sticky juice all over. A crew member helped cleaning the table, yet leaving me with sticky pants and sticky floor carpet under the seat in front of me. Flight EY 6299 - operated by South African Airways, flight SA 279. Service on board, excellent once again by South African Airways. Very friendly and considered staff! On arrival in Johannesburg, about 150 passengers found out that the luggage never arrived in Johannesburg. The queue for baggage claim was very long, yet well handled by South African Airways staff. The entire debacle cost us 2.5 hours! We were told an aircraft would arrive at 16h00 local time with some luggage. At 18h00 hours nothing heard of course. If luggage would not be there with this mentioned flight, it would be the following day. No need to say I have lost all confidence with Etihad."

Sadly, this review is yet another negative one for Etihad airways. As a flight enthusiast I was hoping I'd be able to write a positive review, but my experience proved otherwise. Flight from CPT-JNB operated by SAA. I was warned on booking that my flight from JNB that it would be operated on a Jet Airways configured aircraft. I had the emergency exit and found the seats extremely hard and the planes decor dated. The service was superb on this leg. Hereafter it was my only flight on an Etihad airplane (A320), nothing special. Return from ATH-AUH was on an air Seychelles plane (which was not indicated on booking). The A330 was old and tired. The legroom and seat width were generous, however the IFE was beyond terrible and didn't even have E-Box, not to mention the seat map on the online check in was completely different to the real deal. Final flight was operated by SAA. This was my only option when booking for this date, so I had no choice but to accept the codeshare. Unfortunately the codesharing is limited so on check in you cannot select your seat, as a result I ended up in the last row of the plane (which I avoid like the plague) and thus was doomed with limited recline. I do not think I will be travelling Etihad again, mostly because of all of the ""partnerships"" and codesharing which results in non-Etihad standard service. There is really no comparison to Emirates and Qatar."

It arrived 4 days later when I had already left Cochin and I finally received it 1 day after my arrival back in London. The really annoying part however was that whenever I called the Etihad baggage helpline, I received mismatching information about the location of my suitcase. Overall the organisation of Etihad’s baggage lost and found left room for a lot of improvement.

The 10 abreast seating (17 inch) in the 777 is decidedly uncomfortable to the 9 abreast on Qatar or carriers using the A380. Our flight from Abu Dhabi to Melbourne was delayed by an hour due to late arrival of the flight from London (for which they also delayed flights to Sydney, Brisbane and Perth). But we had been loaded on the plane early - and it was hot given the plane had sat in the desert for the day. Then it took them forever to serve the meals, too bad for those of us wanting to get to sleep. Oh - the wine - where do they find this stuff? Have I ever not finished a glass of red before now? Dessert was a shocker too. All very sad - they had excelled 3 years ago when they flew the A340's."

Terribly handled by the crew, no communication or information given. Very minor compensation given, with minimal information. This is on the back of them losing my bag for three days last year and not taking responsibility, since the last connection was with their partner airline, air Berlin. "

Ian Chow",,13th July 2015,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Abu Dhabi,January 2015,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,4,no,6,"Plane was delayed for an hour and I was informed in the morning. No instructions given other than the fact that it was delayed. After clarifying my flight departure by calling into Etihad's London office, I arrived at the airport 2 hours before my flight. Was told on the spot that the gate had been closed and was blamed by the ground crew for being irresponsible by turning up ""late"" for my flight. It was a really bad experience. Was made to wait 6 hours for my next flight and thankfully, the flight was smooth and inflight crew were courteous. Ground Crew at London Heathrow however were unprofessional."

Cancelled flight and no concern from ground staff (no representative at the desk in Bahrain) - this meant we missed our connection. Fighting (with 2 kids in the middle of the night) and being sent between transfers and departures non stop in Abu Dhabi. Exhausted, begging for a flight on other airline but no one interested. Finally 11 hours later, delayed flight again, we left for Manchester. Reserved kids meal never came because original flight was cancelled. Crew ignore us, sky nanny decided to help by covering my sons face in black and red face paint which he had a reaction to - took 35 mins to remove. Then to top it off, no luggage when we landed and now 4 days in UK with no bags. Complaint form online says 'link does not work'. No one answers helpline. Worse is I have to travel back with them in a month. Had 2 calls from them to say they have no news! Dreading it. Can't think of one good point about Etihad Airways except there was no queue at check in. Now I know why. "

Ignored by cabin crew on requesting refreshments in the rear galley, generally unfriendly service, also commented on by customers behind us on arrival in Abu Dhabi. Food poor.

No Internet, but there was a internet Voucher for 20% discount. Seat 37A was broken, did not want to stay upright. Was given a menu, only to be told we don't have chicken any more. Why give a menu if you can not offer what's on there. Food was one of the worst that I have seen onboard a plane.  As Etihad Silver guest I was disappointed with the lounge in Abu Dhabi airport also, children running all over the place. Abu Dhabi airport is now getting to much.  They offer triple miles on the website when you book, but still did not get the miles, Again why offer something if you don't give it to the passengers. I sent a mail to the Etihad guest program, but till date no reply from them. Don't recommend anyone to take the Johannesburg to Abu Dhabi route and back till they upgrade the flights to aircraft that is not owned by Jet Airways."

Being able to fly directly into regional airports missing out Heathrow is a big plus. Seat comfort not great, then no economy seat is comfortable for 11 hours! I did find the seats very hard and I needed to sit on a pillow. The flight was extremely full - every seat taken, good for the airline but not good for passengers! Food a mixed bag, good dinner on way back but no breakfast served before arrival in Perth instead a chicken dinner meal? Would have preferred a cold breakfast - fruit or just a bread roll option. A potato sandwich was served as a snack before landing in Manchester. The pasta dish was good and the noodle dish was excellent. Ground staff did take a bottle of suntan lotion bought in duty free at Manchester fully sealed in a tamper proof bag with receipt showing, despite being assured by the shop assistant in Manchester that it would not be a problem transiting with it so long as it was in the tamper proof bag. Etihad please communicate with other airports re this if this is your policy! Another point on transiting, I fully understand the need for enhanced security at the gate however once you are in the gate you cannot go out and there is no water available or toilet facilities in the gate. Also better crowd control was needed at Manchester as when announced that rows 1 to 3 could board - literally more than half the passengers stood up and started to queue, despite being told several times not to!"

The aircraft flown was a 2 class 777 and my only complaint is that the seat is rather narrow for a substantial Westerner. The seat was however lie flat and was quite comfortable although storage space for small items is lacking. The service onboard was excellent. The cabin crew were attentive and helpful. The choices available for both food and drink were plentiful and catered to all tastes. The IFE system offered enough choice in film and music although other airlines certainly offer more. I would certainly fly with Etihad again."

The leg room seemed less than other airlines I`ve travelled with for similar long distance flights. The food was poor. On our flight out of the options, one of the 3 was unavailable and they had only just started service. On the way back the dinner options were a chicken dish, a plain pasta option and fish option. After a third of passengers had been served the only option left was fish. We expected more than this and the 3 half glasses of wine we were given on each flight. On the upside the entertainment system was very good, the flights were on time and the transfers went without a hitch. "

Check in at Etihad Air Mall in DXB was smooth and took the coach to AUH. First flight was smooth drinks were passing around all the time, though it is Ramadan. Meal was not good at all,  it was a morning flight they served lunch. With small portions and not up to standards of other competition on the same sector. Crew were friendly though seemed new or a bit lost. Seats are comfortable on the A340. Headsets are top notch but not their entertainment system - not user friendly one and less options. And it doesn't work until half way of the flight and crew collect head sets almost an hour before landing. On the return flight it was almost empty. With a very cold cabin surprisingly there were no blankets on the flight to be offered . No drink rounds. Meal was just a Ramadan Iftar box with some bland sandwiches for a 4 hrs flight. No tea or coffee offered and crew just disappeared. They were very keen on selling their duty free products only. My entertainment system had a problem with the audio and informed the crew - she just apologised with no offer to transfer to another seat with the flight almost empty and many rows were totally deserted and I had to use the entertainment system on the seat next to me which was free as well. Still the seats were comfortable. Would use EY again only if the fares are very competitive. Transfer to DXB with their shuttle bus smooth both ways. However AUH airport is crowded and a bit confusing. "

I had to continuously call ground handling to get updates. Etihad Airways bag tracking site didn't have any updates until the bag was delivered to my hotel. Cabin services are good in terms of food, legroom and staff, but that doesn't do you any good if they can't get your bags on the same flight. "

On the first leg of my journey, I literally had to run to the gate for my second flight and I almost reached at the nick of time. The connection time was around 1.5 hours and my baggage was missing at Cochin. However, airport staff made arrangements to record my details and it was home delivered after almost 40 hours. I found out that the baggage of almost 15 to 20 passengers was not transferred to the second flight in Abu Dhabi. I thought this was a one-off incident as it was the first time ever my baggage was lost.  On the second leg of my journey, my flight was to depart from Cochin at 4.40am on 14th June, but the flight arrived at around 5am and departed at around 6am. I was pretty sure that I was going to miss my flight as the connection time was again around 1.5 hours. I missed my flight and I was given a boarding pass for the next flight which departs at 2.10am on 15th June. This was almost 18 hours at the airport. I was given meal vouchers and a facility to sleep in a sleeping pod. The staff at the transfer desk said that they don’t have enough resources in the airport for staying and therefore gave me the sleeping pod. In fact I found that they have an airport hotel, which they could have made available for hapless passengers like me. I was not the only one and many like me were stranded. Etihad was handling this procedure of managing stranded passengers so efficiently that I think that their stranded-passenger-management system is much more efficient than their airline management and scheduling system.  This seems to be a routine procedure for Etihad. I boarded my flight and it reached Munich and I was more than unpleasantly surprised to find out that my baggage is missing again. I got my baggage a few days later. The air stewardesses were a grumpy lot, maybe they are overworked, I don’t know. The food and service was not good and this is a completely overrated airline. "

Food quality and variety is below par (compare to Emirates lounge). Boarding was smooth but as usual it was fashionably delayed by 30min. Cabin with narrow business class seats and feels squeezed even though I am a petite person. Cabin staff one of the most uncaring bunch of people. Not sure where they get trained and they seem to select passengers to whom they like to give attention and care. This was not the first time but I have raised this with Etihad customer care which also went unnoticed. Many times they forgot or ignored requests for service and acts as if they are doing the passenger a favour! Food excellent. Arrival delayed but the journey was smooth. I wish I could fire Etihad cabin crew and get crew from Qatar Airways or Emirates! Rating down by 4 notch due to this.

My last trip has made me somewhat less enthusiastic. Issues started when I went to KL Ticket Office to change my flights. They changed flights for GBP300 per seat, used to be GBP175 and told me I could no longer have a car from Heathrow to my home at the end of the journey. I explained that I was offered a car when I made the booking, but they said the fare rules had now changed and I was no longer entitled a car. After much complaining and nearly an hour waiting I finally got to speak with the local General Manager. I again stressed I had been offered a car when the booking was made, so I felt they could not simply change the rules. Eventually after 4 days of back and to emails, they confirmed the car from Heathrow. Check in is always a disaster, ditto the Lounge they use. With a couple of flights a day and now with First Class they should either choose a new partner or open their own lounge. The Emirates Lounge is fantastic at KLIA. Flights okay, service and quality of food definitely on the down swing. It's okay but used to be great. Bigger planes mean less attention for passengers which is were Etihad scored in the past. A re-think maybe, before Qatar Airways or Emirates (even BA) start to steal your premium passengers on this route."

Manchester to Phuket in March, returning 20th June. Both times transferring in Abu Dhabi. Not impressed with either the airline or Abu Dhabi Airport. Our transfer time outbound was 1.5hrs. Very long taxiway, then bus to the terminal. After passing through security ""last call"" was being announced for our flight to Phuket. And we still had to run from T1 to T3. Somewhat better on the return trip, with just over 3 hours transfer time. At the time of booking our flights we were informed that it would be A330s all the way. But 3 of the 4 flights were changed to Boeing 777's, one of them without informing us. Seating on the aeroplanes was not good - cramped, not much leg room. Cabin crew were not at all friendly, in fact, rather surly. Food was far from good, in fact inedible. The only thing we can't complain about - no delays - all flights either on time or early. However, on arrival back in Manchester 1 suitcase did not arrive. At least 4 or 5 other passengers from the same flight experienced the same thing. In fact one told us that he had flown with Etihad 3 times in the last 2 weeks - each time at least 1 bag was delayed. I can update progress, having just rung Etihad, the lost bag arrived on this morning's flight. Will hopefully arrive by courier later today. We had to ring them, the website was no help at all."

I found that the food quality has deteriorated considerably from last time I traveled Etihad, not too long ago. The portions were small and the food was not tasty. Just before landing a muffin was offered with tea or coffee. This seems that the airline is cutting cost on their food. The crew seemed to be friendly and attentive. The transfer of passengers from the plane in Abu Dhabi to the main arrival hall in a bus is very uncomfortable because in sweltering heat it is hard to walk up to the bus especially for the elderly.

It included low cost longer flights and intermediate technical stopover in Bucharest. The Air Berlin Abu Dhabi to Stuttgart was the worst flight I ever experienced. Airplane was old, uncomfortable, with features which were common in airplanes of 90s. As my ticket was paid to Etihad I charge them responsibility for it. I have never been given any explanation.

A list of whats bad is much longer than whats good. In short, poor products, service, impolite cabin crew, inadequate food, delayed flights and cramped seats made my experience very bad. While booking through their site, it hung up half way and did not continue. Restarted and tried again twice, again it did not work. I had to call their call center and complain, them book on the phone. I was travelling with an infant. No infant bassinets were available on both trips. Its an easy excuse for them to say ""first come first serve basis"" and ""limited bassinets available"". What's the point of advertising a nanny when even bassinets are not available. On the flight the flight was delayed departing the gate by 40 minutes. To add insult to injury, the temperature was far too hot. Every few minutes there were loud announcements that woke up all sleeping babies. The meal was limited and very ordinary for a ""premium"" airline. The quantity was less too. The cabin crew on both trips were neither helpful nor knowledgeable. I asked for vegetarian food and was given an omelette, despite me having made a request for vegetarian meal without eggs during reservation. When I pointed this to the cabin crew, the purser was very casual and unprofessional with his response. The entertainment system did not work for 40 minutes for no one in the flight, it only displayed route map and nothing else. The collection was not impressive either. I called the cabin crew multiple times, they said they would come back, but didn't come back. In Dubai I had to wait 3 hours for the shuttle bus. The seats were very cramped. Small narrow bodied planes not comfortable to get in or out. During my onward trip, it was ridiculous to see that the bus we were transported from the terminal to the plane was the last one, despite being told that we were given a priority as we had infants. The bus with infants were the last to board. "

Abu Dhabi airport was not one of the most pleasant airports I have been through. On the next stretch of the flight there were issues in that the food service seemed unorganised and random with people sat right next to me getting served 30 minutes before I was and there seemed to be no system in place. The aircraft clean and modern. On the stretch back the service was spotty again.  Overall the flight was very good although not without its problems.

On the first case I was booked business class, but when I got to check-in, Etihad did not have me on the flight list on a full flight, despite SAA being able to provide the codes. I had to wait until 40 minutes before departure to know whether I would be able to fly and then it was in economy class. I was promised follow up - the flight controller even confirmed my email address - I am still waiting. The second time, today, flight EY471 from Jakarta to Abu Dhabi was delayed by three hours. I fly a lot, and I know these things happen. The proof is in how the airline treats you when they do. I am carrying a letter saying that hotels are booked if the new connection required more than eight hours waiting time. Mine requires fifteen. As I could not access a hotel (transit hotel full and I need a visa for any others) I was given food vouchers and told to wait in the terminal. I had to argue for lounge access (this time I am flying economy, but it seemed logical as lounge access Appears to me a notch down from the promised hotel accommodation). I was told it is full. Eventually the desk took pity on me and granted me five hours in the lounge. When I got to the lounge, lo and behold, it was empty. And just now Etihad refused to renew my voucher - from the mouth of an uninterested and unapologetic desk officer. I was also sent to and fro from the SAA desk to Etihad to sort out boarding passes. I have flown SAA for many years, and with many of its Star Alliance partners. I have two thoughts coming out of these experiences, one that I would not choose Etihad or an Etihad code share flight ever again if I can avoid it: even if the in-flight experience is good enough. And secondly, SAA, this partnership and the systems that support it is not running smoothly. The protocols are not sorted. Fix it."

One of them was struggling to adjust his inclined seat while the stewardess spotted him. At first the stewardess asked him politely to adjust the seat. The man answered that he had already adjusted the seat by pressing the button. At the end of the situation, it was realized that the adjustment button was not functioning well, however the stewardess did not change her attitude. On the journey back to Kuala Lumpur, the flight from London to Abu Dhabi was delayed and caused me to miss the transit flight. There was a group of 20+ of us from the same flight stranded. The airline arranged a hotel for us, inclusive of shuttle and meals.  However, the arrangement was poorly done. Little assistant nor direction was given and after we cleared custom, we were just left waiting in the lobby. It took 2 hours for the airline to arrange the shuttle to send us to the hotel and by the time we reached, it was already past 4am! Similar poor coordination during the pick up from the hotel as there were 2 sedan cars picking up 8 designated passengers and later the same shuttle bus arrived. We had all boarded the bus but the driver would not leave the hotel as he was told to pick up 21 passengers and 8 were missing (obviously picked up by the earlier sedan cars)."

Joshua Soo",B777 and A330,12th June 2015,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,KUL to AUH and AUH to ZRH,,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,7,"Flew on this airline on 2 legs, first is from KUL to AUH on a Virgin Australia B777 aircraft (EY411) with a VA crew. Seat is quite spacious and crew is rather decent as well and that goes to the food too. Only complaint is the IFE system which couldn't be turned on for the first hour of the flight but the crew did a good job at managing it by regularly updating on what they will be doing to resolve this. Next leg is on EY73 from AUH to ZRH on an Etihad A330 (EY73). All the reviews about seat being cramped in Economy are definitely true but I would say it's not totally unbearable given that I've sat on seats with similar width and legroom before. But I must say the amount of things they give to you (blanket + amenities kit + inflight magazine + duty free mag) does make the space more cramped than usual as you need somewhere to keep all the items in. Contrary to most reviews though, the crew is quite okay though maybe not as friendly as what you have on SQ or MH. "

Paul Caunter",,11th June 2015,Business,Business Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"Just completed 4 flights on business class. All flights food was inedible. Quality of food has got worse but the fares keep going up! Ground staff useless as usual in Abu Dhabi. A queue for the toilet in the lounge! The whole airport is overcrowded. Cabin staff vary. One flight perfect, on the other three they looked overworked and tired but had plenty of time to chat in the galley. Airport transfers in Bangkok perfect but pick up in London was late. His response was nowhere to park and I should wait outside the hotel on the street for him! Lounge at LHR was another bad experience. A group of about 10 travel agents were going on a trip and were being taken care of by the lounge staff. I had to ask 3 times for a glass of water while they were being given champagne. Other guests that actually pay were being ignored, I have points that will expire this month and can not get a flight that suits my schedule. "

S Cotta",,6th June 2015,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,2,no,1,Trip from LHR - Abu Dhabi - LHR. EY17. Firstly our flight was delayed with no explanation given until we started boarding. Once we started boarding we were delayed further due to unknown issues. The flight itself was very average which surprised me seeing as Etihad puts itself as a leading airline. Service was slow and staff were a bit cold. IFE was average at best. Food portions were minuscule! I would not recommend flying this airline when there are far better alternatives.

Pubby Rajiv",,6th June 2015,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,,2,no,2,EY 103 from Abu Dhabi to New York. I was a gold card member of Jet Airways. Staff onboard were rude service was awful and they only came to see you at designated times such as when they had to feed us. Other times you'd call them and just have to wait. If you wanted a cup of coffee they said that I would have to wait as they would be serving the next meal in 1 hour and I would get coffee along with that. I prefer airlines Airline who deliver service with a smile but on this flight it was angry service and a look of how dare you disturb them. Food served was ok but seats are very narrow and not good on long distance flights.

Anne Thode",,4th June 2015,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,Etihad Service started at the lounge in Sydney with an al a carte restaurant and waiter service for drinks. A small lounge but big enough a huge improvement on the Qantas Business Lounge. Both ways I was in the smaller business class section next to First Class which I much prefer. The service on the flights to Abu Dhabi and on to Athens then return were excellent. The meals appetizing and wines more than satisfactory. It was a flat bed so no problem sleeping a full 8 hours. The return trip was also pleasant and I opted to have dinner after a few hours of sleep. This was no problem. The staff tried very hard but did seem a little pushed to keep up the service on the return leg. I have no criticism and will most definitely fly with them again.

I don't expect a personal service in economy class but just observing the crew I got the impression that they do not want to be there. Food is inedible. I have travelled on many airlines but Etihad's food is by far the worst. If I could rate the food 0 out of 10 I would. AUH-JNB flight on an old Jet Airways aircraft .The only reason I travel Etihad is because I always seem to find the cheapest fare. I would not recommend otherwise. This was my 8th trip with them and I can only say that they are consistently bad!

C McCarthy",,1st June 2015,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,20th April 2015. I flew from Manchester to Abu Dhabi-Abu Dhabi to Sydney return. I was very happy with the seating which I found to be comfy and reasonably spacious. The staff were pleasant and helpful and the food was adequate. The inflight entertainment was great. All in all great value. Abu Dhabi airport has an Irish bar where you will pay £7.50 for a pint of Stella. There is also a smoking room in the bar for those of you who smoke. On arrival at Abu Dhabi you do feel like your in a cattle market but once through passport control its fine. I would fly with Etihad again.

Gordon Michael",,31st May 2015,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,First time with Etihad. Flight 0454 Abu Dhabi to Sydney 13 hours. The flight departed 20 mins late but the captain explained the problem with traffic in the area. Face washes menus kiddies packs comfort packs with sox etc brought around. Real ear phones not plugs etc. I had seat 23 d on the B777 aisle seat with a spare to my right which was helpful. The cabin was neat and clean. The cabin staff were really good. Nothing was a problem. This is a long flight but staff came through every 30 to 40 minutes with water and / or juice. Drinks were served before the meal and with the meal. Meals were ok but I don't really eat much on long flights. I do enjoy a beer and had no problem getting an extra one or two as we approached Sydney. The cabin staff were friendly and attentive. I have flown with all other carriers on the Kangaroo route and on the basis of this flight I would rate Etihad up with the others. At this time they are very competitive so I rate them very good value. We arrived 30 minutes early.

B Thompson",,20th May 2015,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,,,4,no,5,Travelled from Australia via Singapore to Abu Dhabi last month. The flight over wasn't too bad and the crew were pretty efficient and pleasant but on the whole I thought it was a shabby cabin with uncomfortable seats that were almost impossible to recline in fact I thought they were fixed upright as no one seemed to be able to recline their seat. When we travelled back from Istanbul the flight was worse. Once again seats that did not recline without a real struggle and crew that seemed indifferent to the needs of passengers and they seemed to operate in a chaotic manner at meal times. We waited ages for the meal then didn't get the bread roll and after the meal were completely missed when it came to the longed for cup of tea. I had to ask for a drink of water once as they did not regularly come around and I felt like it was an imposition. Some of the crew seemed unfriendly and cold and it didn't make you want to use that airline again. We missed our connecting night flight due to a delay and the next day Etihad didn't put my name on the passenger list for the next leg home only my husband which wasn't ideal and took a long time to sort out leaving us to rush to get on the plane without breakfast or anything. Wouldn't go on that airline again too budget and not enough comfort weren't allowed to book emergency row seats either and my husband and I are both tall people.

I was in Nepal to provide relief aid after the earthquake and was asked to return on the next flight out of the country. Some people would be annoyed that the flight from Kathmandu to Abu Dhabi was delayed which subsequently meant that I missed my connecting flight from Abu Dhabi to London however I was not. The flight from Kathmandu to Abu Dhabi was great I can't complain one bit. I was given my desired seat there was even a seat left between me and a fellow passenger which meant loads of space the leg room was huge. Also as a fairly large guy I was satisfied that the tray wasn't balancing on my stomach for this flight. Once I landed in Abu Dhabi I just missed my connecting flight. The security team were very quick with the bag checks and everything so I can't fault them. I went and spoke to the gentleman at the transfers desk he put me on the next flight out I requested an aisle seat and was provided with an exit door seat. The flight from Abu Dhabi to London was excellent. I'll be sure to fly with Etihad again.

This was a first the check in staff has been excellent in the past. Flight delayed with poor notifications. Crew was pleasant but not friendly.

S H Moolman",,18th May 2015,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,,,5,no,4,My husband and I flew from Dublin to Perth via Abu Dhabi and back on the Airbus A330. From Abu Dhabi to Perth and back we had the same seats 31A and 31C. In 31C there was a terribly cold draft on the aisle seat which resulted in my arriving in Perth with the most severe sinusitis I have ever had and my right shoulder was very sore. I wore a long sleeved shirt a woolen jumper and had the blanket pulled up but despite that it was freezing. On the way back my husband sat in 31C and he had a T Shirt long sleeved shirt and woolen jumper and still had to get his raincoat down and wear that with the hood up. Other parts of the plane were not so cold so there must be a problem with the cold air vents blowing on 31C. It would be useful for one of your crew to fly long-haul in that seat so that you can get the measure of the problem. On this plane there are no individual air vents so presumably the cold air comes in at one spot and that must be just behind 31C. I would recommend this airline to others but not that seat.

C Sridhara",,18th May 2015,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,San Francisco (SFO) to Bangalore (BLR) via Abu Dhabi (AUH). Price was reasonably low. Etihad maintained regular communication about my travel and allowed me to upgrade to Business class. I skipped that offer and decided to travel in economy class. The day before travel I did online check-in and printed my boarding pass. On the day of travel all I had to do was to drop my bags. I thought it was a simple process of dropping them off. No Etihad agent checks the cabin bag for its size and weight and it can not exceed even 1/2 pound. There was no delay in the flight. There was a 10 minute delay. However passengers were greeted by crew members and they helped me to place the cabin luggage. They were cordial and helpful. We were given a hot towel upon arrival as well as the meal menu card. Crew were very cordial and willing to help. After serving the food they ensured the blinds were closed and there was no service for next couple of hours unless called by passengers. There were some empty seats and I was quick to use them up. I was surprised when the crew handed over my special meals to my changed seat. Flight arrived at Abu Dhabi an hour earlier than scheduled and hence we got an extra hour to browse through airport shops. My next flight was in 2.5 hours. What I noticed is that no compliance to ADA rules for Seniors and others who requires wheelchair access to rest rooms or showers. Passengers have to climb three steps to use the rest rooms. The rest rooms at the airport were not clean. Maybe that's the standard AUH airport maintains. I boarded my next flight to Bangalore (BLR) and it was a smooth ride with a different set of crew and services of crew was excellent. I traveled back from Bangalore to SFO via Abu Dhabi and had an even better experience. Overall I am very satisfied with Etihad and would be happy to travel again.

S Lawlor",,16th May 2015,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,We travelled from Manchester to Bangkok via Abu Dhabi. Long Haul flights are not the easiest but our flight with Etihad was more than acceptable. The staff were polite efficient and provided an excellent service. The inflight entertainment system was far more reliable than some other airlines. The food served was probably some of the best quality I have been served on either long or short haul flights. All flights were on time. The aircraft was clean and tidy and the pillows blankets and comfort kits were more than adequate. The new style pillows were particularly comfortable. Abu Dhabi airport was probably the only slight negative. We were crushed into a small holding space and let through into security a few at a time. It was far too small a space to accommodate the number of passengers passing through. Hopefully this will be sorted once the building work is complete. We have travelled long haul with various airlines in the past and Etihad rate up with the best such as Cathay and Singapore and rate far higher than Qatar Airlines.

N Loryman",,13th May 2015,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,no,4,Recently flew Manchester to Abu Dhabi and onward to Saigon Vietnam. I was shocked at the lack of legroom on these flights and found them to be very cramped and uncomfortable for a long haul flight. Incredibly the hours flight from Saigon to Danang via Vietnam airlines was much more comfortable. I think that Etihad would be far better spending money on improving economy class than paying Nicole Kidman to advertise the comforts of business class for the wealthy few. The food was somewhat poor as well. For the first time in 35 years of flying my luggage was not transferred onto the connecting flight to Saigon and I was without it for 2 days. Etihad needs to improve considerably.

I flew from San Francisco to Abu Dhabi and then to Kathmandu and back to Abu Dhabi in Business Class. Then Abu Dhabi to Los Angeles in Economy class. My flight from KTM to ABU got delayed. They were kind enough to fit me onto a flight to Los Angeles the next morning and provided me with a voucher to spend a night at the airport hotel. I upgraded my ticket to Business class from SFO to KTM. Compared to other international airlines their service is poor in business class standard. It took 1.5 hrs to get my drink after the plane took off in Business class - KTM to AUH. On the way back I decided to try Economy class from Abu Dhabi to USA and found out it was the most horrible flight experience I had in the past 26 years flying back and forth from USA to other countries. Let me make it clear it was all about flight attendants. Sixteen hours of journey itself is not that easy. One needs to be hydrated constantly to keep with the long journey. However attendants treated passengers like they are looking for free food and handouts. It was the most pathetic scene. If they can not provide ""free"" food or drinks how about selling? I would be hesitant to fly with them again."

Nothing great but not bad either. 4) I fly economy almost all the time. Even by economy standards I found the seats in AHU-SFO sector to be very congested. It was fine in BLR-AHU. 5) The worst part of the entire thing was the staff experience. In the SFO-AHU flight at least 4 times I had the staff lady tell me ""I will come back to you"" when I asked something and then disappeared. This happened for simple things like water or when I asked her to take a used glass from my seat. Both times I walked to the area and got the work done. I normally choose Singapore Airlines or Emirates. I am sure I will fly Etihad again only if I desperately have to go."

S Scan",,5th May 2015,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,I recently flew from Abu Dhabi to Dublin return on an A330 (SYD-AUH leg operated by Virgin Australia also good). It had been many years since I had made this journey and after reading the predominantly negative reviews I was worrying that long haul travel had deteriorated over those years. Everything was however much the same. I think people need to realise that long haul in economy isn't particularly comfortable but you can make the most of it. I put it in perspective I had 14 hours with nothing to do but watch movies read books and drink wine. People brought me food and I didn't have to do anything for anyone else. No phone emails or pager to distract me. The aircraft was clean seats reasonably comfortable food was fine and the entertainment was good. The staff were friendly and check in and boarding went smoothly. The only glitch was that my bag got delayed by a day on my way there and back however I think that this may have been from the VA side of the operation. All in all pleasant flights.

Lesley Heath",,4th May 2015,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,"Etihad Flight from Abu Dhabi to London last week was very poor. Old plane with little legroom (and we're only 5'3""!). Narrow seats and inattentive staff. We had enquired about the cost to upgrade to Business but no seats available. After a splendid Virgin Premium Economy flight Sydney to Abu Dhabi this flight two days later was a shocker. The pre-flight organisation at the airport was chaotic. We're trying to arrange an upgrade for the first leg home (Frankfurt to Abu Dhabi) and look forward to our Virgin Premium Economy Abu Dhabi to Sydney two days later. This poor service at airport and on flight was astonishing because Abu Dhabi itself was enjoyable - neither chaotic or disappointing."

For all the hype about their premium products their Economy product is nothing short of dreadful. We chose to fly Etihad with our 2 young boys (3 and 1 years old) from Manchester to Sydney because of their so called ""Flying Nanny"" service. Unfortunately we felt let down by the lack of attention our children got from this apparent qualified nanny who seemed on most occasions to be missing in action and when this Nanny was about she seemed less than enthusiastic wanting to interact with the children. I thought nannies were supposed to actually like children. Now I know food on airplanes isn't supposed to be amazing especially in economy but the matter they classified as ""food"" was about as tasty as a smelly sock after football practise in fact a more accurate description of what they were serving up would be slop with a fancy name. I'm pretty sure the sautéed potatoes was cardboard and that kofta isn't a sausage that has had the life shrivelled out of it. The drink selection wasn't better with a smorgasbord of typical commercial larger which leave a disappointing metallic after-taste. In total we flew 4 legs with this lame imitation airline and on each occasion we were delayed by an hour. That's 4 hours in total that. Part of the reason is a lack of staff at the check in counters and the other being the shambolic nature of Abu Dhabi airport where planes are parked willy nilly along the tarmac waiting for a gate to load the latest bunch of impatient and weary travellers while arrivals are ushered into buses like cattle and given a tour of the entire airport before finally dropping arrivals at their intended destination. All in all if you are a parent travelling to the other side of the world with your 2 little bundles of joy only fly this cheap imitation of an airline if it's the cheapest ticket you can find by a long shot."

Andrew Marshall",,30th April 2015,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,I have used Etihad for years now but haven't traveled with them for the last 3 years. We booked flight MAN-HKT and PEK-MAN both via AUH. After reading the reviews on here I was wishing I had booked with Emirates or Qatar. I have since returned and couldn't really fault Etihad at all. What people need to realize when adding a review is that Long Haul travel in Economy isn't great its what you make it. All our flights were on time my wife got her special meals and I had one of the best meals onboard a plane. We had exit seats on the return legs that we booked and paid extra for in advance and this really did make a difference. They have introduced and new pillow that's amazingly comfortable and allowed me to sleep when I don't normally. We were very satisfied with Etihad this time the only let down was the congestion in Abu Dhabi airport its far too small now but you can see the new airport is well under way so this issue should be gone soon. Inflight entertainment is excellent lots of choice and many series box sets now.

I did get rather confused at Heathrow and ground staff at Heathrow were extremely helpful they must have notified ground staff at Abu Dhabi as someone was there to meet me take me through security on to a lovely lounge and escort me back later to the aeroplane. This also occurred on my return trip when I touched down at Abu Dhabi on Fri 24 April. I will use Etihad when possible in the future.

K David",,27th April 2015,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,no,4,Recently flew economy from Sydney-Tehran Istanbul-Sydney with Etihad and overall was not that impressed. On my first flight Sydney - Abu Dhabi I had selected my seat months in advance as I prefer the aisle then the day of check in I saw that I had lost my aisle seat and had been placed in the middle. I managed to get an aisle seat by checking online the next day but only by chance as my several calls to Etihad staff said that there was nothing that they could do about it. Check in staff was okay but pretty cold. In-Flight service terrible barely saw attendants and only two drinks services on a 14 hour flight. Entertainment system was okay but not as good as Emirates. Flight from Abu Dhabi-Tehran was better but only because I got upgraded to business. Return flights from Istanbul-Abu Dhabi and Abu Dhabi to Sydney were also pretty bad and the service left a lot to be desired. One thing that really annoys me is that on all of my flights they stated that the boarding time was one hour before departure but then you would get to the gate and only board 30 minutes before. Overall I would choose Emirates over Etihad.

Alwahedi Saeed",,23rd April 2015,,Business Class,,,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,no,5,I booked a flight to Tokyo at a discounted price an offer by Etihad Airways I came to know later that the fare price did not include the Chauffeur service which was bizarre and unprecedented. The seat I selected when I checked in online was given to an another guest which eventually they gave me the seat reluctantly. The seat was unbelievably congested for myself a medium sized person and I did not receive a personal care kit. The menu offers mainly Arabic and Japanese selections which I found lacking. It took the flight attendant literally an hour to serve me a bottle of water. I selected a Japanese breakfast and they served it promptly however the dishes tastes were bland compared to Japanese dishes I experienced later on my trip. Hence I was really underwhelmed by the experience but maintained my composure throughout the flight and really felt sympathetic towards travelers who were seated in the Economy cabin for 10 hours and surely they had their share of inconveniences. A disappointment for an airline who strives to be the best.

Alwahedi Saeed",,23rd April 2015,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,I had a return flight from Tokyo to Abu Dhabi and I was upgraded to a First Class seat. The 12 hours flight was my best experience to date as I was greeted by the flight manager seated and instructed to relax and enjoy. The seat was comfortable and spacious later on the flight attendant prepared the seat to be a bed which was on par with hotels beds and I spent 8 hours sleeping out of the 12 hours flight. The menu had exquisite selections and the in- flight chief made sure that the food was served promptly and perfectly. The food was a delight to have and memorable to experience. The flight manager was attentive and a good listener he literally meant his instruction to relax and enjoy. Ultimately the experience was overwhelming and sublime. I have had flights on First Class cabin and Business Class cabin but this is the first time I had really met with an outstanding hospitality. I am looking forward experiencing the same treatment and I hope Etihad Airways can make it happen on all of their flights.

T Siva",,23rd April 2015,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,Horrible travel experience to Toronto. Seat change multiple times. When I booked the ticket I reserved the 44A Window Side Seat and it was Confirmed. Boarding Pass confirmed and showed that I got that 44A. When I boarded the flight in Abu Dhabi I got Seat 44A and I was settled and waiting for take off. A few minutes before take off another passenger came and claimed that he had reserved seat 44A. Finally they asked me to vacate this seat just before takeoff. I was given another seat which was not a window seat. The new seat did not have the sound system working for the entertainment. Finally I was placed in seat 55A in the very last row seat close to the toilet and food preparation area. When the flight took off I tried to watch a movie the audio was not working for this one too. I moved to the adjacent seat 55B which was unoccupied however the audio did not work there either. I informed the flight attendant to reset the audio or do something about it however they looked helpless and were unable to resolve this problem. After the meal I tried to move to yet another seat (54F) this time to try to watch a movie but had to get up to make way for the original user who wanted to spread out and sleep using all the 2 seats I was once again forced to leave this seat. This entire experience was very frustrating. Entertainment system is a very basic and fundamental thing on any flight. Looks like there is no procedure to ensure that this basic functionality is available to all the guests.

I am usually on OneWorld and prefer Qatar but was most impressed with Etihad. Not as flashy as Qatar in some instances but genuine sincere and excellent hard and soft product. The Jet flights have good seats - I was worried about the herringbone seating but was excellent. The 787 business studio is world class - first class quality and beats Qatar business. The food is very good - Qatar may be a bit better here and also in the amenity kits etc but Etihad flies first on most routes and Qatar does not so that may explain the difference in the business product. The lounge in AUH is good - Qatar is slightly better but Etihad has an excellent spa and the services are excellent and so is the food. Bombay lounge is the shared lounge and is excellent! The limo services on all ends is excellent- on time courteous and in impeccable luxury sedans. Very impressed and will fly Etihad again!

The flight to AUH was the standard Etihad flight. The menu has not changed - this should be looked into. It was the Jet Airways aircraft with Etihad cabin crew. I actually like the Jet business class seats. I was in row K which is very private as it faces a wall. AUH-DUB: Very long queue to get into boarding gate at AUH - no priority line.

Still given the limitations and the use of buses to take passengers to and from the aircraft it seems to work okay. Flights from BNE to DUB were full. Very good service on board. Easy transit stop in Singapore and very efficient boarding process. Transit in AUH was easier as it was the second wave of flights at the airport and much quieter. However if you board through terminal 1 be prepared for a bit of chaos! Flight to DUB was good. I think that it was used as a training flight for three food and beverage managers. Can't complain too much as it resulted in good service.

A Amin",,10th April 2015,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,1,no,1,March 26 2015 JFK-AUH flight 102 and Apr 4 2015 AUH-JFK flight 101. To AUH boarding was total chaos. Jet Airways staff were curt and not properly stocked. Had ordered kids meals for my 3 kids but none were given - I had to go up to the galley and ask for them personally. Food was well below my expectations. Returning AUH-JFK was terrible. Check-in took 45 minutes because the agent couldn't print our baggage tags. Boarding and the US ICE Pre- clearance was a breeze and we were among the first to board. My wife a doctor herself 6 months pregnant and traveling with a letter from her physician clearing her for travel suffered the most. Once onboard and in our seats a flight attendant noticed my wife was pregnant and asked for her letter. Flight attendant said that the letter was insufficient (remember that this was the return flight - had already been allowed to fly to AUH and had checked-in at the desk gone through two security checkpoints US Customs and the gate agent) and tried to kick her off the flight. After a ground crew member came to ask about our bags (to remove them from the aircraft) and realizing that they would have to remove 7 passengers and 14 checked bags they allowed us to stay but only after delaying the flight for an hour. Food on the return flight was terrible. Small portions poor selection (didn't give us a menu at all). Considering that the return was a 14 hour flight they should have given us more food during the voyage. At least the rest of the cabin crew was relatively nicer but not overly so. Lavatories were actually kept in decent shape and they gave us plenty of water to drink. Upon arrival at JFK the gate staff was rude pushy and noticeably cranky. Will never fly Etihad again.

T Dutta",,8th April 2015,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,"Terrible flight experience. I was travelling alone with my 10 month baby. Hardly received any assistance from the staff. In fact the flight attendants were extremely rude and inefficient. The food was awful and service very slow. I had booked my journey allured by the fact that they have a so called ""flying nanny"" onboard which was totally non-existent. There were hardly any staff attending to our general needs. The experience at Abu Dhabi airport was a nightmare. This was a long journey from Kolkata to Chicago hence had to face a lot of hassle due to the poor service. I will not recommend any mother travelling alone with a baby to fly Etihad."

Alun Williams",,8th April 2015,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,,,5,yes,9,My wife and I travelled Business Class on a round trip from London Heathrow via Abu Dhabi to Phuket Thailand in March/April 2015. This was the first time we had used Etihad and we were delighted. Although the food on the outgoing trip was not quite as good as the return leg it was still very good. The meal on the Phuket to Abu Dhabi leg of the return journey was the best we have ever had on an airline and the service could not be faulted! The wine was excellent and included a Grand Cru claret. To top the whole experience off the service from the cabin crew was absolutely superb they could not have been more attentive and helpful. We shall certainly be using Etihad again.

Mario Sawaya",,4th April 2015,,Business Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,3,yes,9,Round-trip KWI-AUH-ORD. Great airline and the most comfortable long flight I have had. Why? Here's why. First starting with the ground staff who where very helpful and things got better when I got upgraded to B.class. On board the crew were very nice and attentive to details. Calling you by name is something that made me more comfortable onboard. The seat that turns into a fully flat bed is something I really needed and enjoyed during the long trip plus they had the perfect pillow. The food was good very well presented plus served with a smile. If I have to complain about something I would ask them to reduce the volume for the PA on board and to consider spices other than Indian spices in their food. Other than that things were great.

Not enough staff in economy class 2 sometimes 3. Too long to get served. Hot refresher towels 2 hours into the flight. Meals too small in plastic trays. All seemed to be an exercise in cost cutting.

Another mad rush to make flight at Abu Dhabi airport and then waited for over an hour in the aircraft before taxiing to take off to return to Melbourne.

Had to run through the Abu Dhabi Airport (people were holding papers with Frankfurt on it and the gate). When we finally arrived at the gate we were sent back to the immigration desk in the other end of the airport and the Etihad workers ensured us to hold the plane for us (14 people in total). We were waiting in front of the desk for over 30 mins and were them told that the plane left already. One of the worst services I have experienced!

Got on board no one came to see me and introduce themselves. Alone for several minutes. On board chef was very good though. Seats were rubbish. Scratched rugged not the glamour you see in Etihad's videos and on their site. Not leather but cloth. Things broken. Not a good experience. Food was 95% Indian I like Indian food but there must be more choice and variety. Service was not First Class. Un-attentive not engaging. Had to keep asking for them to clear plates provide drink etc.. Would not recommend the morning flight on Etihad/Jet Airways.

It is on the new B787 Dreamliner. Major difference in a positive way to the Jet Airways experience 10 days ago. However this is still nowhere near the Asian airlines. 1) I cannot sleep although I want to. Not Etihad's fault but this airplane has the fancy ""dimmers"" on the windows. There is no window shade so I have the brightness of the moon directly on my pillow! Tried using eye shades and they worked for a while but the cabin will never be dark. Absolutely horrible design - everyone complaining across all cabins that can't get to sleep. It's like having a bright LED lightpost light on all the time. 2) Food: ordered rib eye medium-well. Came out super-well. ""Oven baked French Fries"" are stodgy and not tasty. The beef jus was good. 3) Service is ok. Friendly but still a bit clinical. 4) Seats are fine and better than the Jet Airways cloth. The headphones though have a slight hiss. All in all would not rate this flight positively just because it is so hard to sleep with the light coming into the cabin. It's a 14 hour flight and a waste not to be able to get some shut-eye."

Jayne Hedley",,23rd March 2015,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,,2,no,2,Fly regularly to Australia and NZ this was the first time I've flown with Etihad and I'm sad to say it will be last. The flight from UK left on time crew dismissive and rude to a number of passengers asking for water which although offered at intervals was barely 20/30 mls food on board variable some edible and some definitely not. My meal was frozen and they'd run out of meals. Seats hard narrow and very limited leg room I'm only 5'5 and my legs were cramped with seat in front resting on my knees! Toilets on plane were filthy! Abu Dhabi airport terminal diabolical busy disorganised staff struggled to organise passengers all passengers were asked to leave waiting area at departure gate twice before being requested to queue to go through security before boarding again. Compared to other airlines Etihad layovers are long my connection from Sydney was 8 hrs but due to no crew or plane available for final leg of journey. Further delay of 2.5 hrs no information or explanation given and no offers of refreshments while waiting at the gate we had been requested to remain at. Etihad flights appear to be competitively priced in comparison to other airlines flying to Aus and NZ but as the old saying goes 'you get what you pay for' and in this incidence it's so very true. Its a lottery with any airline and all airlines could do with improving economy class. Etihad more than most!

Sure it is economy but I was expecting at least parity with Emirates (or Qatar) which must be the minimum standard Etihad sets itself by (otherwise what is the point of it). A330-300 on LHR-AUH and 777 on AUH-BKK. Both feeling somewhat tired but the A330-300 was superior as it has a two-four-two configuration. To top it off T3 on AUH was such a big disappointment. I could fly Etihad again if the price is amazingly better than anything else but £50 or £60 less is not worth the transit through AUH or the old looking planes.

Lots of crew but even during the welcome drink you sat for a long time with empty glasses in front of you. The middle row was served from flight crew from each side this means you receive service at different times. Hard facts like cabin uniform dishes etc are nice but we missed the personal touch with the service. During the flight it was not possible to rest at all. Flight crew needs more training to provide a more personal service. At Abu Dhabi Airport during boarding at the gate for our flight to Berlin there was a line for business class guests but this was flooded with y-class passengers. No way to get through to feel the privilege of travelling in business class.

R Sanderson",,19th March 2015,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,"I flew from Toronto to Abu Dhabi and two weeks later the reverse trip. I'll start by saying that I've flown a lot domestically in Canada and internationally though my two Etihad flights were the longest flights I've ever had. My previous longest flights have been in the six hour range to and from European destinations while my Etihad flights were in the 12 hour range. I'm 6' 3"" tall so legroom is always an important consideration. The legroom on Etihad wasn't great but at the same time it wasn't bad either. When the passenger in front of me fully reclined my knees were just touching the seatback on an Air Canada flight several years ago I had to contort because of the lack of legroom on a flight from France to Canada. Regarding inflight entertainment there were enough movies and TV shows to keep me going when I wasn't dozing. I also really enjoyed the food as there was a selection of Indian cuisine throughout and I was never at a loss for drink including wine. On my return flight before we took off we had to return to the gate because of a sick passenger; this delayed things by about an hour and a half causing me to miss a connection in Toronto. Etihad put me up at the Sheraton hotel at the Toronto airport and gave me meal vouchers for the next day. I can say that they were very generous in that respect and they did their best to mitigate an annoying situation."

Food choices were very good and all four sectors were fully booked. Chicken option on Abu Dhabi Manchester route was delicious. Our flight out of Abu Dhabi to ISB had to return back to Abu Dhabi due to some technical fault (one hour inflight) but hats off to Etihad for arranging a new aircraft by the time we landed in Abu Dhabi. The new bridge at Abu Dhabi is very convenient. Security was smooth on all sectors. Etihad ground staff at all airports were very friendly and generous. The fare was very reasonable although I booked this flight 5 months in advance. I recommend Etihad to others and will continue to fly with Etihad. Inflight entertainment needs to upgrade but still worth watching.

I had on a 4 day visit to Vietnam 32 hours delay to spend at the airport. Even access to the lounge was not granted because the flight was ""economy"". No flexibility no help no apologies no feeling at all to make 32 hours waiting just a little more convenient. They just don't care.

This left late as almost every flight does now (previously causing a loss of connection) on this particular leg I was the fifth person asked what I wanted from the menu only to be told that out of three choices this was not available. The entertainment gets less and less and the music selection is non existent consisting mainly of a few compilations. Also they are now trying to avoid giving out fast track cards at London. You almost have to have an argument to get one. I used to have a gold card with Qatar and if they offered me one now I would switch back to them.

In the air Etihad are usually OK. Nothing special but OK. On the ground they are one of the worst airlines I experience. This applies to the online booking process online check in at the airport departing and at the airport departing. It is very clear their management have never tried to use their website or travelled with the bulk of their passengers at the back of the plane. On the rare occasions when their website works at all it is usually wrong or fails later. Information at the airports is non existent and passengers are treated as a major inconvenience to the staff. The frequent flyer programme is appalling. Usually wrong often missing flights. When you try to claim lost miles you get an automated message saying they will respond quickly then wait months for anything to happen. Again it is obvious they don't want to provide what you are due. There is never any sign of management in customer facing roles just a group of people who have no power or responsibility. Finally they are always shouting about being the best airline in some poll. Who do they think they are kidding?

Only 4 seats across the width of the plane yet they had managed to clutter it with so much equipment it was a little uncomfortable. The A380 from Abu Dhabi to LHR was totally different and was a real pleasure. I particularly like the bar area where one can chat with other passengers.

Even though Etihads logo and livery on the metal everything else is from Jet Airways including staff food beverage entertainment system seat and cabin design. Since I am a big fan of EY and didn't expect wet lease service the whole experience was quite disappointing. First of all the menu was all Indian dishes. The onboard chef was apologetic that there was no western food to offer. Beverages were also limited. Amenity kit is non-designer brand and in poor quality. PJ's are again non-designer brand and its material was quite hard and thick. The seat is spacious and fully flat in a private suite. The cabin design is not as swanky as the standard Etihad First class product. The crew were generally friendly but slow to fulfil service requests. Etihad should enhance hard product and service quality of this flight to the same level of the rest of their flights. First class lounge in Abu Dhabi is crowded but service and food is great.

The BOM-AUH portion was on a narrow body aircraft seats didn't fully recline. Its competition flies more comfortable wide bodied aircraft. AUH-SFO was also a disappointment relative to expectations. This was essential a Jet Airlines flight - using its aircraft its staff (except for a few Etihad attendants) and its catering. The only Etihad part was the entertainment system which was fabulous. As a Jet Airways flight it was good - but my expectations were of an Etihad flight. Etihad has heavily promoted this flight in advertisements and on its website - what was offered was far different than what was being advertised. It was a Jet flight. The plane was configured in a ""herringbone"" pattern for business class - a configuration that i find claustrophobic for an 16+ hour flight. Its highly rated cuisine was not on board - there were no Arabic dishes offered. At Abu Dhabi you clear US customs and immigration. While this in theory is great in practice it is far from it. They request that you be there 90 minutes in advance of its scheduled departure. Unfortunately once you get past immigration you are stuck in a rather bleak boarding area with no shops or lounge only a small canteen. All-in-all a underwhelming experience."

The crew were helpful especially since we were traveling with a 5 month old. Check in was a breeze the crew were great helping us take turns so that both me and my wife could have our meals while the other one kept the baby. The food was below par. The next leg of the flight from Abu Dhabi to Dhaka was deplorable. First of all checking in was annoying. Another thing that stuck out to me was yes they had a lot of multi-lingual crew members but if you are headed to Bangladesh it probably would help if someone inflight spoke Bengali. On our way back check in was again easy and that's the only good thing that I can say about our return flight. Inflight service was horrible on both legs of the flight. We were flying on Jet Airways not an Etihad carrier and the crew did not know the first thing about customer service. On the longer portion of the flight from Abu Dhabi to JFK after the first two hours of the flight all the crew had vanished and the only way you would see them is if someone rang the attendant bell at their seat. Overall I was very disappointed with the service.

The FA's totally bad attitude ruined an otherwise acceptable flight though the Chief Steward did all he could to correct the problems and was very apologetic. Will continue to recommend Etihad as aside from the odd hiccup they have an excellent product at a very attractive price point.

Swathi Muthyala",,28th January 2015,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,1) I was traveling alone with a 6 month old baby and during check-in they did not allow even 500gms of excess baggage. Since I had all my baby items we paid extra $50 just for just 500gms of excess baggage. 2) I checked in and was waiting for my flight when Etihad personnel came and asked me to weigh my hand baggage. Since I was traveling with a baby and had to carry the milk supply required for whole flight journey (24 hours) the hand baggage was excess. They insisted that I could not board the flight unless I reduced my baggage to 7kgs or pay $150 for excess baggage. Finally after a lot of drama I reduced my baggage to 7 kgs in order to board the flight. 3) Etihad claims that they have a flying nanny on long journey flights to assist people traveling with infants. This was the main reason why I booked Etihad. However there was no nanny service for my flight from SFO to HYD. When I had to use the washroom and asked an air hostess to stand near my seat in order to keep an eye on my sleeping baby she was gone by the time I came back leaving my baby alone! 4) Seats in economy class are very narrow. I am a person of lean build but still these seats are hardly comfortable for me. Very tough for long journeys.

R Coleman",,26th January 2015,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,MEL-MUC and ZRH-MEL in Economy. After reading some of the negative reviews about Etihad I was a bit worried how the flights would go as I had not flown with them for many years. Fortunately however Etihad exceeded my expectations. A standout on all four flights was the very friendly and obliging cabin crew. They really went the extra mile and are as good as any other airline I have flown recently including Emirates. As mentioned by others the seats on the 777 are uncomfortable after a few hours and the food quality varies but overall I was quite satisfied with Etihad and would fly them again.

C Slater",,26th January 2015,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,,4,no,5,SYD-AUH-GRU R/T. Overall a disappointing experience with Etihad. We flew with our infant and had seen before buying the tickets that they provide an Inflight nanny service (Flying Nanny) on all flights so if you need help with your children they will be there to assist (major selling point). How wrong we were! There was no meet and greet onboard with the nanny and very little assistance (if any) was on hand while in flight. More assistance was given by fellow passengers when the wife was travelling alone with him on the first two sectors. AUH-SYD leg there were 6 infants in the small front economy class section of the 777 and not once did I see the nanny there. I did see her in the rear galley when I wanted the bottle cleaned but she was more interested turning her back and scoffing down her meal while a flight attendant helped. At Abu Dhabi there was no special boarding for infants or children. Meals seat and inflight entertainment were average at best. I couldn't find anything outstanding with this airline except it was the cheapest price we could find on this route. We have vowed not to fly with Etihad again.

Rajiv Naidu",,23rd January 2015,,Business Class,,,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,"I had a very bad experience due to delays in flights and no proper solution to issues. However as a frequent flier I would say even without delays the business class service was very sub par. The food was awful and we were never asked if we needed anything. Please note I was travelling with my whole family in business class. I must also say that on the to flight the staff were excellent however on the return flight definitely some improvements need to be made. I fly Cathay regularly and there is no way Etihad competes with the care of the Cathay staff. Please also see below full detail of other situations we faced. Due to delays we missed our direct connection from Abu Dhabi to Chicago and then were booked on a flight from Abu Dhabi to Washington DC and then from Washington DC to Chicago. Usually when this happens an airline upgrades you however not in this case. What is worse is that at my seat the entertainment system did not work properly and needed to be re-booted over 5 times. Please note not once was asked if I wanted to change seats. I was also flying with my 2 young children. We originally bought business class tickets. On the 7pm flight there was a first class however Etihad booked us in Economy. Due to another delay we missed the original re-booked flight from Washington DC to Chicago and were told we were re-booked on a flight which leaves 3 hours later. Upon arrival in Washington DC I asked if we could use the United lounge as I was with my family and stuck in the airport for over 3 hours at no fault of our own. I was told to ""calm down"" and was refused. For a flight which was supposed to arrive in Chicago around 3pm my family and I got our final luggage at 11.35pm."

Faisal Mustafa",,19th January 2015,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,10,One of the best rewards programme. Excellent food lovely cabin crew most of the time. Ground staff are pretty decent too at LHR MAN DOH and of course AUH. Interior is excellent. flight times and waiting times between DOH to UK are usually fine. I only wish EY would fly to BHX directly so that my journey would be DOH-AUH-BHX instead of having to do the whole DOH-AUH-AMS-BHX. Still other than that I continue to fly with EY because of their good service and lovely rewards programme even if it does involve inconvenience. I highly recommend this airline.

C Brown",,19th January 2015,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,3,no,3,London to Johannesburg via Abu Dhabi. I travelled with Etihad this time last year and was pretty happy with the service and thought it was good. I pretty much always pick the cheapest flight with the least amount of waiting so thought it was good. A year later I used Etihad again and I am not so impressed. Between the two Etihad flights I flew with Emirates which I found to be far superior. The staff were friendlier the seats more comfortable the food nicer and the entertainment far better. In that year I found Etihad to have slipped a fair bit. The service was not so great and staff didn't come round to offer drinks so regularly. The food on the Etihad flights is ok but there never seems to be anything other than curry! Even for breakfast there was curried chicken and the sandwich snack was the same! I didn't bother to eat because of this. The choice of entertainment was also very poor. There was not a vast choice of current films a choice of only 2 (old) documentaries and the music selection was really poor with no track listings or individual artists just compilations of various artists and no information. There were hardly any children's films either it was very poor.

Great new plane with easy to use and comfortable seats and wonderful attendants. They even came to ask whether they could make my flight more comfortable? I can't wait to fly this airline again.

Brian Nick",,19th January 2015,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,7,Return flights from KUL-AUH-DUB on January 12th. Boarding in KL was hassle free and quick. Flight was with Jet Airways at 2.30am took off on time and light snack served. Cabin light dimmed until 2 hours before landing however flight attendants brought regular drinks through the cabin. Breakfast was fine as was entertainment. Flight attendants were professional but not overly friendly. Boarding for flight to Dublin was chaotic to say the least. Only one person dealing with approx 300 passengers until eventually 3 more arrived. Suddenly we had 4 chiefs and no one willing to do the basics of checking people through. Words cannot describe the inefficiency of what was happening. This meant after a bus ride to plane we were an hour late taking off. Welcomed on board by name by the flight attendant at top of steps. This set the tone for the flight with smiling attendants who were very obliging to every request. Food was fine and again regular drinks brought through cabin. Overall an ok experience apart from the disaster that is Abu Dhabi airport.

Sheehan Mathewt",,19th January 2015,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,2,no,1,I would not recommend Etihad. I flew from Perth to Munich via Abu Dhabi and return. Food was generally terrible. All options were gone by the time they got to me leaving only fish which I don't eat. After a fuss they found me a no-fish meal. The hot food is served in a plastic-lined container the taste of which went all through the food. Every corner is cut with the airline. the hot towels are disposable they do not separate or recycle any of their waste the blankets are thin and small barely covering your arms. The service is not very polite and frequent. The cabins are clean and presentable but that's about it. It is a very cramped cabin and for the price which was more than other airlines that offer great service its really not worth it.

Subsequent to this was scheduled to flight EY 101 to New York at 12.00pm but the flight did not take off until early morning 2am.

G Umiker",,14th January 2015,,Business Class,,,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,,2,no,4,"Business class passengers boarded in the same crowded and uncomfortable bus than Economy not even separated by a strap. Business class seat is very uncomfortable (compared with other airlines such as British Airways Swiss United Airlines). Not very large as kind of ""wall"" next to each seat. Due to this wall you can sleep laying on your back but don't even try to sleep on your side you won't be able to fit your legs. This is very uncomfortable and as I said not that large for your arms. You just can't get comfortable. We waited a long time on the ground and waited 25 minutes to receive any information from the crew. finally took off with a 1.5 hr delay. Service was ok and food very good. Missed our connection ZRH-GVA and was told or to wait 7hrs for the next Etihad regional flight or to go by train. They didn't want to pay for a seat with Swiss that was departing 2hrs later."

O Finlay",,14th January 2015,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,,,2,no,1,I have travelled twice on the Dublin - Abu Dhabi Route in the last month the seats are tiny with very little leg room and I am a small person. On the 4 flights the food offered was awful so do pack a lunch for yourself and you get offered very little to drink a half full glass/cup of tea cola or wine. You have to ask and ask to remind them to give you another juice. The food trays were left for a long time before being cleared away. The staff were not at all happy either on the ground or in the air a smile and eye contact go a long way. Check in on the Etihad Desks in Abu Dhabi is very slow so give yourself plenty of time. One of the flights was delayed 3 hours with no meal voucher offered so I decided to use the Lounge but was told my Silver card could only be used in Terminal 1 I was flying out of Terminal 3! I never had an issue getting into a lounge in any other airport. Etihad Advertisement is great but the product or service is not great. Taking all things in it might be better to fly in and out of Dubai as it is only 2 hours down the road. All that glitters is not gold with this airline.

The cabin crew on the first leg of the journey were rude and seemed uninterested. The seats are small and there was no soap in one of the lavatories. I would not recommend transiting in AUH. The airport is crowded and filthy. Duty free and eating places are limited and cramped into one place. You could barely move. The food onboard the flight was terrible. I'm baffled as to why this airline is voted one of the best airlines. The second leg to Singapore was a much better experience. The crew were friendly and attentive.

R Sebastian",,14th January 2015,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1,no,1,Besides the already stated problems of extremely bad seats and miserable service the airline has no sense of timing. We missed our connection from Abu Dhabi and to get an alternate route we were put onto a long endless queue with a lot of people in the same state. The connections that were found were through at least 3 stops when there were direct flights available. They did not offer a hotel room though meal vouchers were provided. The food on the airline caused a stomach bug which I am still recovering from and our baggage which incidentally were not re-routed like us made it to us a week later. The worst experience ever.

Buehler Marc",,11th January 2015,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,2,no,6,We flew Geneva-AUH-Phuket and back in Economy over the Christmas holiday. The flights to Phuket were pleasant on time and smooth. Service is pleasant food is good and seats are cramped but not more than on other airlines. The way back was less smooth as the flight to AUH was delayed 5 hours due to fog in AUH and we missed our connection. Luckily we got another connection that left AUH to Geneva (also delayed) with a 6 hour transit. While I find Etihad a good airline the problem is the AUH airport. Almost all flights are served by buses there are not enough toilets and the food court offers average food. Also the fact that one needs to stop in middle of the night in AUH instead of going direct exposes the travelers to risks of delays and long transit times. Etihad is still far away from competing with Emirates and needs to focus on having a top quality airport which can handle all its passengers comfortably and fix the systems so that some simple fog does not shut down its airport!

Service was slow inflight entertainment poor comparing to other airlines food was good but on 1 flight they had run out options on 2nd flight had given the wrong menu. Abu Dhabi to Male was delayed with 1 hour once on board we sat on plane for another hour - during the wait no explanation of the delay from the pilot or cabin crew. As a result - we missed our sea plane and had to stay overnight in Male instead in the resort. Overall really bad experience. Wouldn't consider travelling with them again.

D Jacobs",,11th January 2015,,Business Class,,,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,,,1,no,1,SGN-AUH-BRU on 02/01. Worst experience in my 30y plus frequent travelling. The flight departed SGN ca. 1 hour late which still left enough transit time in AUH. During the descend into AUH the cpt announces severe problems with fog and was ordered to circle till further news. On top the lighting system on the runways broke down due which further circling needed. After ca. 30 mins circling the plane is diverted to a nearby airport where we stand at the ground for 3 hours. We then head back to AUH (15 min flight). The crew assures us that no flights departed and all connecting flights would still be there. Ground staff guided us to the premium lounge at T1 where the desk clerk told us the BRU flight left already anyway and she would rebook us onto the next flight. Whilst I wait for the rebooking I see the original BRU flight appearing on the screens for departure 13hr. I notify the clerk who denies the screen data but confirms it after checking again anyway. It's ca. 7am at that moment. She tells us to move to the T3 premium lounge. The desk clerk there confirms the 13h departure and tells us to sit and wait in the lounge till the boarding is announced at gate 44. At that moment gate 44 shows boarding for Brisbane. The next few hours I check on a regular basis with the staff for any change (AUH is in total chaos at that time). Each time they confirm the details. At 12h still no boarding and we're told flight is further delayed but they will announce boarding in time. At 13h30 I go to the gate where the screen still says Brisbane flight is boarding. I ask the boarding clerk if BRU is next after Brisbane to which she tells me she is boarding Dublin at that moment and the BRU flight left 30 minutes ago. What happened then is just too much for words to describe. We ended up being moved to a hotel at 6pm rebooked to the next day's Alitalia flight to Rome with a connection to BRU. Arriving in Rome the next day it turns out we're not in the system for the connecting flight to BRU and both Alitalia and SN flights are fully booked. As a last resort I went to the Vueling ticket counter where they had luckely still 3 seats left on the 18h05 flight which I had to pay for myself. So instead of a planned arrival into BRU on 03/01 at 7am we finally arrived at 04/01 at 9pm. Needless to say without luggage. Unless the only other option is going by foot I will never fly Etihad ever again.

Seats were by far the most uncomfortable I have experienced very narrow and hard. Sat on 2 flight cushions to attempt to ease discomfort but it didn't make much difference. We had emergency exit seats with extra legroom and just don't know how other passengers in standard seats managed incredibly narrow and I am slight build/slim - heard similar complaints from other passengers. 10 seats across - 3 each side and 4 in middle. Found some of the crew to be arrogant/rude. However was informed that with almost 400 passengers there was a crew of only nine in total! Food never good on airlines but this was disgusting! All in all pretty appalling.

Two moans - I had an outside aisle seat on two legs and it felt very cramped - a cleaver configuration but it does not really work. Came back from London on the A380 and was very impressed and had a window suite which was very good and private. Transfer through Abu Dhabi not too good compared with Doha. Etihad offered turkey on Christmas day flights which was one up on BA. Service was OK but they start well and then loose interest after the initial burst.

My flight from Dublin to Abu Dhabi was good and the service at the Dublin lounge is up there with the best - the staff servicing it are a credit to this company. Unfortunately anything of quality was absent after that. Abu Dhabi ground service facilities attitude and bad manners is worse than shocking. Flight departure services for EY408 to Bangkok on the 27th December was an absolute nightmare. Sitting on a bus for more than 40 minutes to get to the plane another 20 minutes waiting at foot of aircraft to board a clapped out 777 which had only one stairway for as many passengers that this plane holds. It took ages to board. Then met by a surly unhappy looking crew that took little interest in their premium ""guests"" - seats worn and tired aircraft showing its age toilets filthy and unkempt. Flight late into Bangkok. The major problem using this airline is it's annoying inconsistency. Excellent flight service at both Dublin airport and onward flight. Nightmare from landing to arrival in Bangkok. Greatest comfort is I still have choices."

I was quite happy with the experience from LHE to Abu Dhabi (AUH) and then AUH to JFK but on the way back from JFK to LHE it was a terrible experience. At JFK boarding gate nobody could hear their announcements as the speaker quality was very poor. Boarding process was not very quick and also they were not really good to handle ~ 250 passengers on gate. Although flight experience was OK from JFK to AUH but upon arrival at AUH they informed that flight from AUH to LHE is at least 12 hours delayed because of heavy fog at destination. It was quite surprising when they refused to provide any hotel room and asked us to spend the whole night in the airport. I had no other option except spending the night on airport chairs after a 13 hours flight. I would not recommend travelling with Etihad Airways.

I don't think we did any sector that would be classed as good. The seats are small and uncomfortable the staff did not seem at all interested in the passengers and we had great difficulty even getting a second drink (would have thought we were alcoholics). On nearly every sector they locked off one of the toilets and this made it difficult as all flights were full. The galley is badly designed as people had to queue for the toilet in the galley which obviously made the crew a bit cranky when they were trying to put things away. I can never understand why they put quite hot curry on flights.

Check in online was fine and was allowed to change allocated seats to a pair of window seats. Check in was very smooth and they checked our bags all to way to Penang even though our final flight was on a separate ticket. Boarding was very civilised. The flight to AUH was bumpy initially and the captain informed us that it would continue until the North Sea which it did and the crew went about their work. They were friendly smiling and engaging the whole way. Food was good and drinks were also good. Crew answered every call immediately. Only drawback was long bus journey to terminal building. Flight EY416 was with Jet Airways operated by Etihad. A lot of confusion having boarded the bus to aircraft and then waiting on bus for 35 mins and again a further 15 minutes at plane. Once boarded everything was similar to first flight although a marked difference in crew for who it was a challenge to offer a smile. That said they were professional in their approach. Entertainment systems on both flights were good with very good selections of movies and programmes.

Having flown many airlines I found the Etihad experience very good.

D Jacobs",,29th December 2014,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,no,5,BRU-AUH-SGN in business class. Etihad has a competitive price on this route but their product is just average and below the standard of e.g. Qatar Airways. Their business class on the A332 is fairly cramped both seat space and cabin space in general. Manoeuvring through the cabin trying not to disturb sleeping passengers is tricky and I'm just a 1.80m 78kg guy. That same average goes for the food served. Flight crew was friendly and efficient. But the worst is that you have to transit Abu Dhabi airport when flying with them. By far one of the worst airports I have ever visited and I travel extensively for the last 30 years. For some reason they forgot to install a sufficient number of toilet facilities resulting everywhere even in their business and first premium lounges for waiting lines of 10-12 people. That itself is reason to avoid any airline transiting Abu Dhabi.

The obligatory 90 minute delay leaving AUH negated any time advantage however.

This is the first time I have travelled with Etihad and it will be my last. The seats must be the smallest and hardest I have ever sat on in an aircraft and the room was so bad it was impossible to pick up anything off the floor without belting my head on the seat in front. They were so close it was even impossible to stretch out fully. If I could give a 0 out of 5 for seat comfort I would. Service and meals were adequate and the inflight entertainment was the usual standard for international flights without being exceptional. Avoid this airline if at all possible - there are heaps more comfortable airlines to travel with. I think I would even prefer Jetstar to this one and I never thought I would get a worse outfit than Jetstar.

The cabin must be among the worst for space and comfort. If you can get the same fare with another airline then I would advise you to take it!

A Cairns",,18th December 2014,,Business Class,,,2.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,3,yes,8,We connected from our Bangkok to Abu Dhabi flight (EY401) which was horrendous. However we were pleasantly surprised by our flight EY45 Abu Dhabi to Dublin (9th December 2014). The crew were fantastic attentive professional efficient especially the male crew member. Nothing was too much trouble. The business class cabin is still one of the most cramped we have travelled in but the cabin crew made up for any discomfort.

M Magennis",,18th December 2014,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,6,I had not flown Etihad and booked Sydney - Rome return without viewing the reviews. A few days before flying I did read the reviews and was horrified and really worried! However on both outward and inward trips I can say that apart from the lack of legroom (this is true) I was pleasantly surprised by the cabin crew who were both friendly and efficient the meal choice the inflight entertainment and the on ground services. The seat itself was comfortable and I managed to sleep (it's a gruelling 14 hour flight). Apart from the narrow legroom I cannot fault this airline. It may not be the best but it's OK and well-priced.

Nige Brink",,10th December 2014,,Business Class,,,5.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,10,I flew from LHR to AUH in business with Etihad. It's been years since I have been to T4 and I was surprised with the changes and improvements. Check-in was super-fast. I was given an invitation card to use the Gulf Air lounge as the Etihad one is closed for refurbishment. Fast-track security was quick and I was airside in about 3 mins! Like most airport terminals there are loads of shops but I made my way to the lounge. The lounge was nice and I was welcomed at the reception desk and given a slip of paper with the wifi code. Plenty of space and great views of aircraft. There is a staffed bar and the barman was happy to mix up any cocktails if he had the ingredients. The champagne and port were both nice. The toilets seemed much better than the ones in BAs lounge in T5. In fact everything about the lounge - including the staff - seemed more welcoming. Lunch was being put out in the food area. Fairly good selection and it was tasty. I got to the gate after most passengers had boarded so don't know if priority boarding was used. Found my seat and was offered a choice of champagne water or fruit juices. Had the champagne and it was nice. I found the seat very comfortable. Food is served when you like. Mumm champagne served once airborne and it was cold and fresh. It did look like the individual cabin crew on each aisle were a bit stretched especially as each order is taken for drinks fetched from the galley and then served. Looked like a lot for the crew to do in a full cabin and with the result that it took a while to get topped up. The food was delicious. Just the right amount and very tasty. The IFE was ok. Arrivals at T3 was fine though the priority tags on the bags didn't seem to make any difference. I waited about 45 mins for my case. The limo service to the hotel was great. All in all a great flight and I'd definitely fly with them again.

As I was in Dubai my pickup point was in Etihad Airways office in Dubai where I was able to check-in early with my baggage. Travel to Abu Dhabi airport in the Etihad bus service with the boarding pass. It was a 3.5 hour flight quality of service was good and the food was aesthetically pleasing. Blankets provided and inflight entertainment seats were comfy.

A Maraey",,10th December 2014,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,,,2,no,1,Roundtrip flight from Cairo to New York JFK with connection in Abu Dhabi. The problem happened with returning flight from JFK to Cairo specifically the second flight from AUH to CAI. The flights was supposed to take off at 00.50 24th November 2014. We boarded the aircraft but we stayed 2-3 hours due to fog after which we were transferred back to the airport. The fog cleared at around 7am. Nevertheless there was no real updates about the flight. The flight took off at 1:00 PM after 12 hours from the designated take off time. After 13 hours travel from New York and 5 hours transit in AUH was only offered a meal. No hotel provided. We were forced to wait 12 hours expecting take off at any time making a nap risky. I'll never book with Etihad again.

J Clarke",,10th December 2014,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,DUB-DEL via AUH. Staff onboard recognized me as a Gold member on both legs without prompting them which had been hit and miss last few trips. It is always a nice touch when they do that. In general the staff were all good - friendly helpful and professional. The flights were on-time and went smoothly for the most part. The only issues that I had related to New Delhi arrivals. For some reason there were no foreign entry cards available to any passengers on the AUH-DEL flight and I was told at the immigration desk that I had to get my own card fill it in and cut the queue again which made me feel uncomfortable. They should have these on the flight. I have noticed this issue before where sometimes they have the cards and sometimes they don't.

O Lu",,10th December 2014,,Business Class,,,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,,,3,no,2,I recently flew Etihad from the US to India and Maldives. Overall a very disappointing experience. While three of the flights were unremarkable / average for business class three of them were downright abysmal. Among other things Etihad doesn't seem to comprehend the concept of on-time departures - all six flights were delayed by an hour or more. Yes it happens but 6 times in a row?. The Jet Airways aircraft have seen better times and this is Etihad's way of making an entry into a new market. The airport in Abu Dhabi especially Terminal 1 is awful. Three of my six flights all international involved a bus service and a hike up the stairs. The flight crew were a major disappointment on most flights - they try but in most cases don't come close to the class and experience of world-class airlines (e.g. Singapore Asiana Cathay). In 20 years of flying for business I never had to wait 10 minutes for a flight attendant to answer a call. In the end my conclusion is that regardless of how much money Etihad spends it can't buy class / elegance - perhaps one day they will get close however I don't think that day is near.

Poddar Subrata",,10th December 2014,,Business Class,,,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,,,1,no,2,I had the most disappointing travel experience with Etihad. I travelled from Jeddah to Narita and back last month and still regretting the decision to fly Etihad. The business class beds on the Abu Dhabi-Narita sector is the narrowest that I ever travelled in. What was most apalling and disheartening was the arrogant attitude of the ground staff on my return journey from Narita. As I had a 9 hour transit time in Abu Dhabi we had requested hotel accommodation. We had got a written confirmation that hotel accommodation was to be arranged on arrival at Abu Dhabi. However when we reached Abu Dhabi at 5am - we were told that there was only 1 room (we were 3 business class passengers) available! The staff refused to entertain or make any efforts - their simple response was their system says 1 room. When we wanted to speak to Duty Manager - we were told he will be available in an hour and will meet us in the Lounge. There was no sign of Duty Manager until 8am! We were finally given rooms in the Airport Hotel at 930am. When I sent a complaint on the airline website the responses did not even attempt to explain why they could not provide rooms after confirming or why the Duty Manager never showed up. Instead they appeared irritated by the complaint and added insult to injury by unilaterally closing the communication. Welcome to business class travel!

The inflight service was excellent attitude of the crew was friendly. My stop-over in AUH was about 4hrs I went to the pearl business class lounge it is the most luxurious lounge I have been too. My next flight EY305 on the A340-600 which is unusual because Etihad airways operates A320s to KWI. EY305 was also fantastic. The only thing that I did not like is that the A340-600 seats are still the old business class. Overall I enjoyed my flight.

Really pleased with all sectors of this flight. I had requested a special meal on all four sectors and this was served to me. On one flight the snack box contained meat sandwiches and I'd requested vegetarian - the flight attendant instantly swapped it for a crew vegetarian meal. I was really pleased with this. Flying Nanny is a great idea. Crew immaculately turned out. The service was great. All flights had blankets pillows full meal service (even on 4 hour flight). A world apart from US carriers and the budget airlines currently in the UK.

After reading some of the reviews on this website I was fearing the worst. However everything was OK. The planes left and arrived on time. The service was fine. Drinks were available when needed. The meals were OK - no worse that any other airline economy class. Booking in luggage was easy and the staff were polite. My only gripe was that seats on the 777 from London to Abu Dhabi were a little cramped and the flight was full. I am over 6ft tall but I managed OK. The big upside was the cost of the trip. London-Brisbane-Perth-London (4 flights) cost £753.

W Kimmel",,20th November 2014,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,7,Sao Paulo to Abu Dhabi then Abu Dhabi to Mumbai. I fly United internationally a lot from the US so I was eager to compare my first Etihad flight. I was in Economy on the A340 for both legs. Things didn't start off well. The check-in process in Sao Paulo took a full hour. Told that their system was running extremely slowly that day. Both flights were late taking off. About a hour each. The communicated progress pretty well. Food was good headset very nice blanket and pillows good quality and the entertainment options were good. I lucked out and had an entire row of four seats all to myself so I was able to lie down. I was disappointed by one of the flight attendants during the service. Despite the flight not being crowded she was quite surly. Dishing out drinks without even looking at the passengers terse frowns all around. The other flight attendants were fine. United gets poor marks for service but I think the service I experienced on board was comparable or less good than what I usually get on United. It's just one flight though. They collected headsets and turn off the entertainment way before the flight ends - 40 minutes. I can understand collecting the headsets but why turn off the movies so early? Will I fly Etihad again? I don't see why not but it wasn't the most amazing experience. Perhaps my expectations were too high since I'd heard and read so many good things.

Glossop Ross",,17th November 2014,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,6,Perth to Sao Paul on Etihad via Abu Dhabi. Now economy travel is pretty basic on any airline. We had some positive and some negative experiences on this trip. The positives well the flight was delayed leaving Perth by about 4 hours how can this be a positive? Well flights can be delayed we received some food vouchers and when I complained about some consequential costs to us of this delay the customer relations people on the internet were very quick to respond and to offer compensation and they followed through. Negatives the communication at the airport could have been better (the ground staff were pretty invisible) all people want is some information about what is happening and know when the plane will depart having someone around taking the questions is the best way to keep people happy. The real negative was the legroom. I am comparing economy to the economy of other airlines on the trip we took and we travelled on 5 other airlines in economy. It makes quite a significant difference to the comfort of a long distance economy flight. The in cabin service on the two sectors was variable in quality and sometimes (in the evening ) you had to wave your arms to get some water or attention. It is a good airline and they were responsive to my concerns for which they get a 10 out of 10 but really tight legroom makes for an uncomfortable flight. I would fly with Etihad again probably not on such a long leg as Abu Dhabi to Sao Paulo.

The handling agent staff were poor - shabby uniform and very low on personality. The flight was on time. The seats were comfortable on-board mobile network throughout the journey wifi equipped. I received the special meal which I had requested at the time of purchasing ticket. Flight attendants were attentive and took good care of all passengers including kids.

M Baughman",,12th November 2014,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,"EY130 and EY131. Etihad has 2 really great features that I'm not aware of from any other US-Middle East carriers. First if you buy a business class ticket there are times when you get a chance to bid for a first class seat upgrade. Maybe its for Gold members and I have upgraded with pretty modest bids. Second you clear US customs in Abu Dhabi so you enter the US as a domestic passenger. I fly out of Washington Dulles the absolute worst US gateway and not having to get stuffed in a ""people mover"" waiting a half hour for the entire plane to cram on the bus and then get dumped into immigration after a 14 hour flight is incredible. This airline has really improved dramatically. AUH airport has its issues including a new premium lounge that is still too small. Attentive staff everywhere."

A Cooper",,6th November 2014,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,"Terrible for economy passengers! I flew business class with Etihad in 2012 - business class was bearable but when I flew in economy in Oct / Nov 2014 it was the worst airline I have ever flown with. The cabin staff attitude towards economy passengers is poor. My husband and I pressed the button once to ask for a drink and the stewardess looked inconvenienced by us. We paid $5000 AUD for the two of us to fly to Dublin and back and it will be the last cent Etihad ever get off us. The inflight entertainment that they brag about hadn't been updated so the movies / tv shows / documentaries that the magazine promoted didn't match what was actually offered - instead we had to watch old movies old tv series and the ""latest releases"" in the movie section were at least 12 months old.

Julie Marland",,3rd November 2014,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,,,3,no,2,We flew economy from Sydney to Dublin via Abu Dhabi and then from Paris to Sydney via Abu Dhabi in October. The in-flight entertainment is great personal screens and a wide variety of entertainment choices. The seating is incredibly tight and uncomfortable. I had to sit on my travel pillow to alleviate the discomfort. Regarding food service my daughter had ordered the gluten free meal but on both long haul flights there was nothing for her first meal. Something was scrounged up by the second meal but that is a long time (over 10 hours) without any food and no one seemed concerned. It is hard to get any assistance from the flight attendants but that is understandable as there are only a few of them and a LOT of passengers to deal with. We managed an upgrade to business class on the shorter flight from Paris to Abu Dhabi and I must say here is where Etihad shines. The attendants were attentive and helpful. Once again there was no gluten free meal available however something was put together straight away. The seats are wonderful (with inbuilt massager) and a real sense of space is created. This flight was a thoroughly enjoyable one. Unfortunately business class is not within our budget.

We found the 3-4-3 seat configuration on the 777-300ER to be cramped and not particularly comfortable especially if the person in front put his or her seat back. The AUH to SYD leg was on a A340 which didn't feel as cramped (2-4-2) although I found the seat to be harder. Meals were average and of standard fayre but my wife found all of her pre-ordered vegetarian options to be very poor. The IFE was acceptable. Cabin staff were OK but nothing special. Abu Dhabi airport was transited with ease although we remained within Terminal 3 throughout. Flight delays were minor. If price was the sole determining factor I would recommend Etihad however on this overall experience I know there are much better options to be had elsewhere.

Boarding fine and again 75 minute delay in departure. This airline is no good if you do business as most flights are delayed. F Class service is very mechanical nothing you would write home about. The food was acceptable. The seat is extremely hard. Conclusion Etihad is an airline who invested money in other airlines but has not after so many years brought there on house in order. I missed a number of connections (with no assistance) in the past nothing to write home about and very little features and benefits. The Airport is a mess the staff are extremely unfriendly.

Brenton Bulmer",,31st October 2014,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,1,no,3,Took 4 flights with Etihad in October Perth to Abu Dhabi Abu Dhabi to Rome Paris to Abu Dhabi and Abu Dhabi to Perth. My wife and I were on our honeymoon and these flights were such a disappointing way to begin and end our honeymoon. Check-in at Perth airport was fine and easy but I think that was simply because we were the first in the queue. There was no control around boarding in Abu Dhabi or Paris it was simply get in line and walk on the plane most airlines will board based on rows so that there is not a hold up inside the plane but Etihad don't seem to grasp this concept. Our flight from Paris was delayed in departure by over 1 hour because the plane was late yet we were not informed of this until 30min after we were supposed to board. The food on all 4 of our flights was almost inedible on our Paris to Abu Dhabi flight the chicken that was served to me was cold and we actually had to ask for our meals as the staff bypassed us completely when we complained we were told they thought we had already been served. When we got to the gate in Abu Dhabi on our return flight we were told that we either had to leave our duty free purchases from Paris behind or have them added to our checked baggage because it was an Australian Government regulation when we argued with Etihad staff and showed proof of what the government regulation actually is they denied it and said we either had to leave it behind or check it in. Luckily our duty free purchases made it onto the plane as checked baggage but we were not impressed. 3 of the planes we flew on were A330 the toilets on these planes were certainly smaller than usual on an A330 and I have flown on quite a few. The Boeing 777 we flew on kept having the overhead storage compartments open during flight so obviously the plane required maintenance which had not been undertaken. The only good thing about this airline was the on-board entertainment selection. Everything else stunk I will never fly this airline again and would never recommend it to anybody. In hindsight we should've paid the extra couple of hundred dollars and flown Emirates.

Liked the fact that they didn't serve a full meal at 2.30 am but a snack bag and a full breakfast just before landing (Air Berlin did it they other way round) so you can get as much sleep as possible on this 7 hour flight.

Tejasvi Addagada",,28th October 2014,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,3,yes,7,It was a pleasant onboard experience with Etihad except for excess baggage charges. To start with the ground staff was inviting cordial and pleasant. I had to carry an excess of 9 KG of baggage for which I had to shell out around £235 which was a shock to me. I tried to suggest that my existing miles could be used to increase the baggage allowance but the systems did not have the capability. The manager provided me with a discount of 1KG which I was not satisfied much with. The meals served were impressive service was fine inflight entertainment largely remains the same across all airlines so not much of a takeaway here. I have read many reviews on leg space being cramped up on the BLR-LHR route but I found it comfortable based on me being 5'11.

Just under an hour check in a slow moving queue at Terminal 4 as the online check in facility was not available. Slightly late departure from London and I found the 777-300ER cabin layout cramped in 3-4-3 configuration the actual seat was reasonably comfortable. Entertainment selection was good with responsive touch screen system and good headphones. The biggest let down for me was the cabin crew they did not really provide any ""good"" service or smiles the male crew in particular I found quite arrogant and more concerned about how they looked. No water runs offered by the crew throughout the flight you had to go to the galley. Return flight to London over an hour late departing and once again I found the crew lacking completely no tea or coffee was offered to me with the breakfast and when I asked the attendant for one he looked at me like I was being a complete pain. Would try not to use Etihad again unless they were very cheap compared to other airlines."

Searle Wendy",,22nd October 2014,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,3,no,2,We flew from Sydney to London Heathrow. First part of the flight was code shared with Virgin Australia. This was a 14 hour flight to Abu Dhabi and was fantastic. Unfortunately that's where it ends. From Abu Dhabi to London was dreadful. The seats were so small that one felt claustrophobic. My husband and I were in the middle and aisle seat. We had a well built young lady sat next to us who also filled in half of my husbands seat. (He sat in the middle). The food was horrible. As it was a night flight we were given a breakfast bag consisting of a bread roll filled with meat an orange popper and a fig filled cake. Breakfast was served about 2 hours before landing and not only looked unappetising but tasted it too. On the return journey back we had the same kind of flight to Abu Dhabi which once again was dreadful. The flight attendants all looked miserable and the service was so slow. The empty meal containers were not cleared away for ages and nobody seemed interested if you rang for service. All in all I would not fly Etihad again. I have flown both Emirates and Cathay Pacific to the UK and will return to them.

A Allen",,22nd October 2014,,Business Class,,,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,,,1,no,1,"Terrible experience with Etihad. Booked 5 business class seats Sydney-Abu Dhabi-Cairo return for family with 3 children. Thought it would make the trip easier as younger 2 kids only 5 and 2. Also Business promised overnight hotel accommodation in Abu Dhabi so we justified the huge expense and thought we'd travel in style! Every leg we were seated separately including putting the 2 year old next to strangers. Just assumed I guess we would have seating together. After first leg refused to change seating for other legs. Refused - told we had to wait until on the aircraft and for attendants to approach other passengers to change. Watched anxiously on every leg as they seated and settled every other passenger before they would try to get my kids near us. Arrived late at night after long flight into Abu Dhabi from Sydney expecting hotel room. Airport almost deserted eventually found long line of weary travellers waiting for single attendant. Waited in line for 2 hours with children and adults close to hysterical by then. Eventually reach end of line and are told no booking made for room for us - then later found. Kids in separate hotel room on another floor! Unable even to have adjacent rooms. Service in plane polite but hardly existent. Bell would expire before attended. Twice sent feedback to Etihad. First not even answered second approach through social media got quick request for details which I provided. Response then was not an apology but ""disappointment' at my negative 'impression' of their superior service and well trained staff. They assured me that just because I didn't get my 'preferred seating' (as if I'd just wanted a window seat rather than to be near my children) they win awards for their 'inspired' experience. Would never fly Etihad again!"

But Virgin won't give us any points or status credits blaming Etihad. Very poor code-share arrangement and we will be taking this issue to consumer affairs since it is counter to Virgin's website statements. I have read elsewhere that others have had similar experiences.

There was no choice in meal rice with chicken there were three pieces of chicken in the whole meal and the desert was a small chocolate bar!

Flight from Dusseldorf to Abu Dhabi (Business Class) - A330. Check-in in Dusseldorf was smooth and straight-forward. No Etihad lounge but can use Air Berlin (not very good lounge). Toilets small dirty and shared between a number of airlines. Boarded flight but departure was delayed slightly. Must commend Etihad staff as the flight was superb - excellent food excellent service attentive and friendly. Seat comfortable but prefer the window seat as it offers more privacy than the aisle seat. I have now travelled with Etihad 8-10 times this year and their standard has certainly improved and continues to do so. Well done. The only comment I would say is that the inflight entertainment although was good on this flight it was not very good on the outward and previous flights.

This was my first Etihad experience and was unsure after reading some reviews but was pleasantly surprised at the efficiency. Only a slight delay on my return flight but I didn't mind because it decreased my stopover in Abu Dhabi. Quick and efficient check-in friendly staff. Having always flown Qantas or SIA I decided to give Etihad ago and would definitely travel with them again. I consider myself a low maintenance passenger so rarely ask the cabin crew for anything but did notice that they were not particularly friendly or helpful to other passengers. I rarely eat on a plane and so can't really comment on the food but it looked like usual plane fayre.

Coming back via ZRH-DUS-AUH-KUL was complete hell because we had to use Air Berlin and Jet Airways. Paying full-frill fare with 1/3 journey by full- frill airline and 2/3 journey using budget airlines means Etihad has brought air travel to a new level of mockery.

McDonell Kate",,12th October 2014,,First Class,,,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,"SYD-LHR early September 2014 and return early October First Class. What a waste of money. We had travelled twice before with this airline to Europe in Business class and once in First Class but never again. The food service airport lounges and entertainment were very second rate. Their first class boasts that they have an in-flight chef but he does nothing other than heat and supply the food already mentioned in the menu. Nothing special and what meals we did have were almost inedible - although we had particularly requested seafood the only seafood was baked salmon. Years ago lobster tails but no more. The staff were very pleasant. The seats that turned into beds were not as comfortable as we had in Business and the noise from the aircraft was so bad that we ended up trying to sleep with noise cancelling head phones on. One entertainment unit did not work properly and had very little choice for any TV or movies programs. The staff could not fix it. Also the selection left a lot to be desired as it seemed to cater well for children but not adults. When you have a 14 and 9 hour flight you need a good selection. The first class lounges in both Sydney Abu Dhabi and London were all shared with Business and all were every full. We were advised at the time that the First Class lounges were being 'renovated' - and in both London and Abu Dhabi the queue for the ladies was very long. So much for the extra attention and privileges we should have been accorded with the extra money paid for First Class - non-existent. How this airline gets to be the so-called ""Worlds Leading Airline"" beggars belief."

The food was very good. A330 cabin was comfortable and the flight went quickly. Departed and arrived on time bags waiting for us and the limousine pick up was an added extra. Flight home was overnight and not nearly as good including the food which was plentiful but bland. Decided not to eat and slept comfortably on the flat bed instead. Overall for my first flights with Etihad I was impressed.

Wish I hadn't. The exit row seats while offering leg room are very narrow. The snack pack offered on the early EY11 departure was sufficient just before sleeping. The pre-landing breakfast was OK. It was a shame one isn't able to use the great IFE gate to gate.

Rose Penhale",,28th September 2014,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,2,no,2,EY141 to Toronto - Sept 23 2014. Flight attendant ignored me (seated by window) a few times as they brought snacks and drinks to the two men beside me. I had to speak up and do a hand signal for them to attend to me. The light call for an attendant was ignored for over an hour that I had to flick the switch on and off after that to even get their attention as I was just too parched and finally when they showed up I had to asked for 2 full glasses of water. It was pretty slow service all along. Even retrieval of food trays took ages. The meals were unappealing compared with other airlines I've flown with previously - and 2x they did not give me an choice but just gave me whatever. I do not know why and at this point I could not care - as I feel I have a better choice of airlines in the future.

A Althani",,17th September 2014,,First Class,,,1.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,,,3,no,6,Upgraded from business to first class I wish they had not. I have a problematic lower back - the First Class suite is very private but the seat gave very little lower back support and for me the business class seat is more comfortable. The staff on board were very attentive and helpful the Chef came and saw I was not interested in the meal options so he offered to make me a Teryiaki Chicken which was delicious although the Pumpkin Soup was lacking in both consistency and taste. The cooler wasn't working on the personal mini bar and those two drinks were undrinkable. The entertainment system was good - it had a few nice classics and also a very good selection on new releases . We arrived with a ten minute delay into Abu Dhabi from Paris CDG but my connecting flight into Doha was delayed by an hour because a few passengers checked in their luggage but did not make the flight. Etihad has excellent on board service but airport services baggage handling and crisis management really let their passengers down!

I'm realistic about what to expect in Economy I'm a budget student traveller after all but the service was so indifferent on all legs of the journey. All flights were delayed by at least 2 hours luckily they all had a large amount of connecting passengers so the following flights were held for us. Food was terrible I've had a lot better in economy on Qatar and Emirates. Cabin crew were ok nothing more nothing less no one smiled no one cared never really experienced such indifferent service from crew on any airline. Last time I flew Etihad was in 2010 on the same route and they were great they seem to off fallen hard. I'll stick to my trusted Qatar next time.

The chauffeur pick up worked well and the lounge at T4 was very good. Staff very attentive. On A340 on both outbound legs and food and wine of good quality. On the way out visited the crowded lounge in Abu Dhabi but managed to have a shower and the staff helped find me a place to sit. Inbound first leg on code share Virgin Australia. Etihad seats far superior as every seat has an aisle access. On the Virgin flight (777) I had a window seat and had to climb over the passenger next to me when he was sleeping. Pleasantly surprised to find the new premium lounge was opened in Abu Dhabi on the return leg. Staff very welcoming and lounge at least 3 times the size of the old one. Food and wine again good on return legs. My only criticism is that the entertainment on offer is nowhere near what it is on Emirates or Qantas.

F Weeren",,17th September 2014,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,,3,no,1,"Flew (August 24) MCT-AUH-GVA. A320 plane supplied for the MCT-AUH flight was tired filthy and should not be in service without a complete cabin redecoration. Seats were stained carpets filthy and the seat pitch was best designed for circus midgets. We were delayed 30 minutes at MCT with absolutely no explanation in English perhaps one was given in Arabic. In AUH I hurried to my next gate for the AUH-GVA leg of the journey I made the plane which pleased me. The A330 was noticeably cleaner although the seat pitch was still better designed for research monkeys than human beings. After being rushed on board we sat for quite a while until someone from the flight deck finally explained that there had been an oil spill on the airport and that we would be sitting another two hours at the gate until the runway was open again. Being a sound and reasonable man I understood why passengers could not be let off the aircraft again. Water and paper ""hot towels"" were their only attempt at service in 150 minutes? Their first step should have been prompt announcements in both Arabic and English explaining what was happening then informing us that we would be served beverages and that the inflight entertainment system would be turned on. Food served was a joke on this flight - first a snack (late night flight) consisting of awful sandwich rollups with the advice that we would have a ""full breakfast"" an hour before landing in GVA. The full breakfast was tired and ridiculous - nothing approaching a full breakfast anywhere. Upon arrival at GVA I was one of about a half dozen passengers whose baggage hadn't ""made the flight"" despite 150 minutes extra time at the gate. It took three days to get my bag to me. Now let's turn to the return trip flown two days ago from ZRH-AUH-MCT. In ZRH we were boarded promptly and the aircraft another A330 was cleaner than the A330 from AUH-GVA. That sort of tells me that you need to better supervise or replace your cleaning staff at AUH your home airport. The flight was not full so there was room to spread out which many passengers did immediately after ""boarding completed"" was announced. We pushed back with Swiss precision on the dot. Food served was delicious plentiful catered by Swissport/LSG. In AUH I made my way to my departure gate in another Terminal weaving through what have got to be some of the longest walks in any airport anywhere. Luckily here and there were moving sidewalks although these were usually clogged so I was actually worried I would miss my connection in the relatively short transfer time allotted by Etihad of only 70 minutes between flights. I needn't have been worried. After reaching the gate it was again a story of sit sit sit. No explanation. No communication from the airline. Suddenly almost an hour late we were rushed onto the bus to the aircraft. The air conditioning was not on. After 10 minutes of waiting there was a terrific lurch and air conditioning came on. On the (same) plane familiar conditions - filthy tired upholstery dirty carpets ridiculous seat pitch. And again we sat. This time however the captain communicated with us in excellent English. He didn't provide any explanation for the delay but at least gave us accurate estimates of when we would actually take off. And he apologized which surely must have been regarded as unusual by the crew as they seemed shocked when he did so. The only silver lining in this very cloudy tale? This time the delay must have been enough time for my luggage to make the flight."

The route was Perth to Manchester with the normal stop over. Well what I can say is that the below reviews are spot on. The seat is far too narrow I'm 6ft and weigh 84kgs and I struggled in the seat compared to the other major airlines very disappointing. The meals were ok but again I've had better economy food the soup was running down the side the fish was well over done etc however the breakfast into Manchester was good. I will not be using this airline again for the money paid I wish I had stuck to the normal trusted airlines that deliver.

S Kumar",,14th September 2014,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,I flew Etihad for the first time this August because I found an incredibly cheap fare. I flew 4 sectors and I was pleasantly surprised and pleased with the overall service standards. The aircraft's were clean and everything worked well. Most importantly the toilets were clean on most sectors. Very disappointing that passengers dirtied and water clogged toilets on the Istanbul - Abu Dhabi sector. The IFE was adequate even though I found it repetitive during the 3 week period. I feel the content should be changed every 15 days. I had ordered special meals AVML and was served on all 4 legs. However I also found that the person in charge of menu planning needs to look at a little change. On all 4 legs I was given Green lentils in the salad. I am sure a little more variety will not cost anymore. On one leg I had a Green lentil salad and a yellow lentil dhal curry so two lentil items in one meal. On the AUH-MEL sector the flight took off 2 hours late. The boarding commenced late and were kept seated in the aircraft for over an hour. Were advised due to congestion. Still a 2 hour delay is unacceptable without a good reason. We arrived at least 1 hour late in Melbourne. If the fare is reasonable I will fly Etihad again.

Was told that the flight would be just like an Etihad Flight. No such luck. The layout of the seats in Business Class is completely different. Privacy of the seats is less and the middle seats cannot be combined like the normal Etihad cabin layout. Next the menu - All the entrees and appetizers were Indian. The ice cream which they served from the all day dining was quite inferior. No steak or sandwich choices like the flight to the USA a couple of months earlier. No Wifi on the plane as an option either. Choice of videos does not seem to be quite as extensive but not sure on this.

Im 6.3 and found the seat right on the cusp of being too small so if you are 6.4 you'll have to bend your legs a little and may find it a little cramped. I travelled with my wife and for the long 14 hour trip we had the middle buddy seats and we really enjoyed it with the divider down of course. The shorter flight I had a window seat and found it to have slightly more leg room than the middle seats. I'm around the 90kg medium build mark. All the seats were comfortable. The pillows were proper pillows and the blankets very comfortable. Amenity pack also provided. Throughout the entire journey all staff were friendly and helpful whether it be at check in aircraft or the lounge. I do believe Etihad are in the process of having dedicated lounges which will also add to the whole experience. The Melbourne lounge is shared with several other airlines and not the greatest but its quiet and offers the basics. Abu Dhabi lounge is to small but for an hour stop over was adequate and had a large variety of food and drink on offer. Meals were very good and having the anytime menu is also a plus. Inflight entertainment was excellent. I would have liked noise cancelling headphones as is offered with some other airlines in business class but they were nevertheless comfortable. Aircraft were in excellent condition and pretty close to brand new. So overall a very good experience and wouldn't have a problem booking with them again.

Melbourne - Abu Dhabi upgraded to business class. (8 out of 10) good service. However business class beds really not as big or comfortable as represented in advertising (I am 6ft1). Abu Dhabi to Dublin - average - 6 out of 10. Arrived Dublin and luggage not there. Farcical is a polite way of describing what happened next. Assured it would be on next flight ex Abu Dhabi. All problems were blamed on Aer Lingus. Went to service desk at Dublin airport prior to leaving. Left Dublin for France a week later with still no luggage. Two weeks later return flight to Brisbane. Check in at (CDG Paris). Business / Gold member lounge excellent (10 out of 10). Flight CDG to Abu Dhabi (freezing cold) IFE Good meal service amateur at the most and they ran out of meals. (2 out of 10). Abu Dhabi airport on return trip a total complete and utter shambles. Completely out grown what it was designed for. Flight one hour late and using the same excuse that has been used for my past 7 flights. Arrive Singapore - excellent - good staff who want to do their jobs. In round and out quickly and professionally. Flight Singapore - Brisbane (4 out of 10).

As for the flight itself I did not expect to have my economy seat to feel so cramped. Maybe because of the dark brown color scheme that it felt so cramped. Also that distinct Middle Eastern aircraft smell made my allergies act up throughout the flight. I wasn't able to enjoy the inflight entertainment because of my allergic condition. The meals were ok but nothing spectacular. Overall pretty much an average airline for economy class despite all the hoopla and press releases about it.

My food service was poor and the flight attendant kept bringing me the wrong order. When politely asked to change the temperature of the cabin or bring me the correct order the flight attendants gave inadequate responses. My inflight entertainment experience was also poor since they brought me damaged headphones and when I asked for a replacement they gave me cheap economy class headphones.

They left the menu card when passengers were sleeping and when passengers asked (including us) what was for Breakfast they said look in the menu and all of us were looking for this menu. One passenger found it and handed it over to about 5 others. I thought this was very rude wouldn't hurt them to say what was for breakfast since there were only two options. Overall flight was cheap and good - will recommend and travel again.

C Povey",,28th August 2014,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,5,no,1,Shocking. Delayed departure flight missed connecting flight as a result and technical problems on return flight causing hot cabin for almost an hour on tarmac in Abu Dhabi with no air-conditioning. Bad entertainment. I have never heard a pilot apologise as many times before for inconveniences - at least 15 times. Baggage lost as well.

O Soliman",,28th August 2014,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,LHR-AUH-SYD return in Pearl Business. First impressions mixed. I was trying to secure a single window seat throughout the journey but I kept receiving error messages on their website. I had to call their call centre multiple times to get this sorted. Chauffeur service in London was great. Check-in was smooth and staff provide you with Express cards for security and immigration. I saw that I was assigned a new seat and when I questioned this I was informed that there was an aircraft change but that I still had a window seat. Our planned B77W was substituted for with the A346 (F1 livery) in old Business Class configuration. The inbound flight from AUH was delayed over an hour but the Etihad Lounge at T4 was excellent with great food and very friendly staff. Upon boarding a steward approached me and asked if I would like to change my seat with a mother and her kid since I had a bulkhead seat (11A). I asked where the new seat would be and was told it would be a middle seat. I politely declined but he kept insisting. Following a lengthy argument he finally decided to leave me alone but whenever I encountered him later on in the flight he gave me nasty looks. The old Business Class seat was ok not too comfortable and quite narrow (and probably not suitable at all for tall passengers). Once in the air service commenced and I was fortunate to have a lovely English lady serving my row who provided excellent service. Food was excellent and offered in generous quantities. Abu Dhabi airport is absolute mayhem. The walk from the gate to security was too long and it wasn't quite clear while standing in the security line that premium passengers enjoyed a separate lane. Once cleared I asked a member of Etihad staff for the whereabouts of the smoking lounge and she sent me on a goose chase to a closed lounge which was 10 minutes walking distance. When I came back I informed her that the lounge no longer existed and then proceeded to the Business Class lounge (which ironically had it's own smoking lounge). The lounge was excellent and there were tons of food options available but really very limited seating. The flight to Sydney was on a B77W with the new Business Class configuration which was a marked improvement. Seat was bigger and wider and quite comfortable but you can't help but regularly bump your legs into the tray which is a design fault. Once again flight was late to depart but service was top notch and all meals of outstanding quality. On the return flight I had the pleasure of experiencing the Etihad Lounge in Sydney one of the best I have ever been to with superb staff and a la carte dining. Flights to AUH and LHR both departed and arrived late. Overall Etihad is a great airline. They have some things to iron out (buggy website all my flights were delayed lounge in Abu Dhabi etc.) but I would definitely fly them again.

Annette Marks",,26th August 2014,,Business Class,,,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,,,1,no,1,We recently flew business class Brisbane-Singapore-Abu Dhabi-Brussels and return Paris-Abu Dhabi-Singapore- Brisbane. I am a coeliac so ordered gluten free meals. The standard of the meals can only be described as very poor and inedible in some cases. My husband's meals were also very ordinary. We have both had far better meals in economy on other carriers! The service from the flight attendants was also very mediocre with requests for tea/coffee going unanswered. There was little recognition of business class with priority boarding etc. When you pay extra I think it is reasonable to assume you would expect extra. We were bussed for what seemed miles in 40 plus degree heat to our plane in Abu Dhabi and were late leaving with no explanation. This resulted in us being late for the remainder of the journey. Two pluses I can mention are the bed configuration and the new lounge at Charles de Gaulle Airport.

We recently flew from LAX to HYD and back with a stop-over in Abu Dhabi. Our nightmare started from LAX EY 170 was delayed over 2 hrs and we missed the EY 274 AUH-HYD. Monitors on EY 170 gave incorrect information that EY 274 was also delayed by about 2 hrs. Upon arrival at AUH we were told by Etihad staff that EY 274 had departed and we had to stay overnight to catch the next flight in 12 hrs. Waited in line for over 90 mins. to get processed to the hotel etc. When angry passengers asked about this the ground staff said the on-board monitor information was incorrect - no apologies offered. Repeat of above on the return flight EY 275 HYD-AUH on August 18 again delayed take-off at HYD and missed connection at AUH. This time we literally ran to the LAX EY 171 gate as the AUH airport monitors showed EY 171 ""boarding soon"" but about half-way to the gate were told by an Agent that EY 171 had taken off. Again stayed overnight to take EY 171 the next day (August 19). Economy class seats hard uncomfortable and ""sliding seats"" not recliners flight attendants unfriendly drinks first offered about 14 hrs. into the AUH-HYD flight! Meals sub-standard/small portions. Overall terrible experience with Etihad which started LAX-AUH service in June poor on-time performance disorganized ground staff poor in-flight service and callous attitude."

Paul Chacko",,26th August 2014,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,3,Our saga started on Aug 18th from Cochin Airport. Abu Dhabi bound flight (EY281) was scheduled to depart at 4.25am. The Boarding Pass said Gate 2 but the electronic display in the airport was showing Gate 6. ETD remained 4.25am until around 4.15am and that's when the announcement came: EY 281 was delayed until 6am because the inbound flight was delayed. As we waited the next announcement came at around 5.30 with a new ETD which is 6.30am. We approached the Etihad desk and they promised the connection flights would wait for us. Our EY 281 flight finally took off around 7.07am and touched down at Abu Dhabi airport at 9.47am. The (cold and stale) breakfast was served 2 hours after departure. When we landed in Abu Dhabi connection flights to various destinations had already gone. There were agents at the airport who directed us to the Transfer Desk. An Etihad agent approached the NY bound passengers and told us there was a flight leaving to NY in 2 hours and there were seats available. 20-25 passengers whizzed out to the gate the agent directed but when we got there the gate was already closed. We turned around frustrated and came back to the Transfer Desk. Cries from 20-25 passengers were ignored. We had to wait another 2 plus hours before we could talk to the ticket agent. He found seats for us on a flight 14 hours later but to our surprise they could not provide us with accommodation. After about 20 minutes of pleading they agreed to give us rooms outside the airport so we were transferred to a limo waiting area. We waited there for about 40 minutes and got transferred to a hotel. Eventually the 2.10am flight took off at 3.40am. They started to serve the meal about an hour later but to my dismay turbulence started and the pilot ordered the cabin crew to return to their seats. It took another 30-40 minutes before they resumed the food service. We finally landed the 8.55am flight in NY at 9.07am. I waited for about an hour but there was no sign of my luggage.

We paid $8000 for a business class trip to Europe from Australia. 2nd leg on the way over we were downgraded to economy with no warning no explanation (until we complained) and a totally inadequate $200 ""bribe"" to shut us up. Add to this a 1 hour delay taking off several staff not caring at all of our inconvenience a broken AV system in my economy seat and I am sure you can guess that I would never recommend this airline ever again."

C Bellman",,20th August 2014,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,3,no,1,Aug 14-17 BAH-AUH-CMN / CMN-AUH-BAH. Etihad markets itself as a 'leading' airline of the world. I must say they fall well short of such grandiose marketing. Cabin crew are cold unhelpful and frankly have an attitude in dealing with pax. Abu Dhabi airport ground staff are totally overwhelmed and unable to effectively manage the transit pax arriving at AUH everyday. One need only look as far as Etihad's abysmal on-time performance statistics for testament to how poorly the logistics are run. Aircraft are generally outfitted well although IFE is second rate but this does not go very far for pax experience when complemented by the horrible service on board.

The cabin crew on this flight was exceptional. They turned up the cabin temperature when asked and they were very friendly. The seats were the most comfortable I've sat in in economy class however this plane dud not have power points as expected. Departure was more than an hour later than expected. The connecting from Abu Dhabi to Rome was on flight 83: departure was late and complimentary grooming kits were not provided. It was on this flight that I realized that Etihad does not pay any attention to detail. The return leg of our trip was on flight 84 from Rome to Abu Dhabi on 9 August 2014. Departure was more than an hour late. The cabin crew was as cold as the cabin pressure which was freezing despite numerous requests from ""guests"" to turn up the temperature. This is unforgivable. I have never been so cold on a flight. We connected in Abu Dhabi to Johannesburg on flight 602. This flight had power points but was also more than an hour late. 45 minutes due to the airline and 30 minutes due to a customer. The cabin crew on this flight were helpful and efficient."

When angry passengers asked about this the flight attendant mentioned some problems with AC and that it would work after take off.

Maurice Huze",,14th August 2014,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,,3,no,4,What a disappointment. I flew London to Abu Dhabi and onto Melbourne August 11/12th. Both flights were delayed although connection was made the flight out of Abu Dhabi was an hour late with no explanation. I chose my seat online 54K as recommended however all seats are hard and very narrow and watching the screen was not a comfortable experience. Surprisingly with so much content to view the movies on offer were woeful. Meals were below average and partly frozen! Worst of all was the indifference by the flight attendants to the blind gentleman sitting next to me. I had to call them to assist otherwise they would have done nothing. I had to open his meals cut it up and put fork in his hand and in effect do their work.

Our experience at Heathrow Terminal 4 Etihad Business Lounge was amazing great people smiling great food and great service. On our journey back home we did the same upgrade in Business Class. It was fine from Mahe to Abu Dhabi but our stopover in Abu Dhabi was 8 Hours. We were not afraid as based on our experience in Heathrow we thought it would be just great. What a disappointment! At 2am in the morning on 5th August we came to the reception of Etihad Business lounge and we were declined access for the simple reason that our tickets were upgraded from economy. Furthermore the Staff at desk were both arrogant and unhelpful. So we had to wait in this ugly airport with all coffee shops closed until 6am to have a coffee. I complained to customer service and just received a polite answer but no compensation. I will never fly again with this airline.

A Althani",,11th August 2014,,Business Class,,,1.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,1,no,1,Most of my travel is for holidays and two of my last two trips were on Etihad. The first was to South Africa on Etihad and South African the latest was on Etihad and Alitalia - both disastrous. We travelled from Doha through Abu Dhabi to Rome and onto Venice waiting for our Cruise in the Mediterranean now Alitalia ground staff have been on strike. Etihad knew of this strike but still checked my bags through to Venice knowing my bags could have not made it through. It has been three days without our bags and they can't even locate them and I will have to go on a 12 day cruise without luggage other than that I will have to fly with them to go back home.

Please do not take my criticism wrongly Etihad's service on board is one of the best in the business but the end result is what lasts and when you end up in a hotel room getting ready to get on a long awaited cruise holiday without your clothes you begin to ask yourself why on earth did I fly with these people and why did they not re-route me when they knew about the problem but still took the risk with my holiday!

Pros: The planes are new and in good shape. Fabulous IFE so you're entertained which is a crucial factor for me. Cons: Seats are too cramped. More importantly on most occasions staff are unfriendly. Every time I travel I say I'll give them another chance but same old unfriendly staff attitude. You feel you need to beg them to do their job! Despite the above I'm still using Etihad as sadly my other alternative would be Egyptair who don't have an IFE on AUH flights so I'm stuck with Etihad.

E Smith",,11th August 2014,,Business Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,2,no,5,We upgraded to Business Class from Manchester to Abu Dhabi and were underwhelmed. Both flights were late (although not significantly) with no explanation. The seats are quite comfortable although a bit narrow and clearly it is better than flying economy. But the service was very below par. On the first leg the crew were pleasant and attentive but got several things wrong (eg bringing the wrong meals). On the second leg though (a long one) the crew were awful. In my view we didn't even get economy class service. Nobody introduced him or herself they staff were off-hand to the point of rudeness the meals took forever to come and the staff didn't respond to any minor requests. For example I wanted a little sugar to sprinkle on my breakfast cereal-I was told that only sugar lumps were available and it wasn't until I suggested that I could go myself and collect some from economy that some appeared! This is just one example of the inadequate and even offensive service. My main course at dinner was almost stone cold and because I had waited so long for it I didn't send it back but it was really horrible. This has never happened to me in scores of long-haul economy flights. Also our trays did not have the correct cutlery on them so we had to keep asking for appropriate utensils. Again this doesn't happen in economy! Another issue was that when one pushed the button for service nothing happened. On two occasions we waited for over ten minutes and nobody appeared. Altogether - very poor we would never fly Etihad again. I have no idea where they get the good ratings that they boast about. The only good thing about the airline is that the call centre staff are very pleasant and helpful.

Security check as always long queues since AUH airport has not been able to catch up with the growth in pass anger numbers. Boarding chaotic and unorganized. Flight departed an hour late due to heavy traffic. Seat the usual hard and narrow affair. The very busy FA's tried their best but they were clearly understaffed on this full flight something I've noticed on another flight a month ago. What really upset me was the ""breakfast"" they served. I opted for the Asian option beef congee. It was about 100 ml of rice soup with a drop of Soya sauce and a few pieces of ginger. Beef could not be found. This was the most disgraceful meal I ever had on a flight and I fly a lot. Etihad claims to be the world leading airlines but I wonder who voted for them certainly not y class passenger."

V Sharpe",,3rd August 2014,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,To be perfectly honest two of the four flights by Etihad were ok. However the other two were so bad that they are hard to forget. The cabin crew on these two trips were mostly indifferent and disorganised. The seats were hard narrow and uncomfortable and with two tired children crying as well due to the huge delays it all added up! We had a bassinet seat and were told on the phone that we could use a bassinet but when we got there they said the baby was too big. The baby never got fed on any of the trips without asking and literally begging. After one hour and 40 minutes after adult meals were served and asking six times we were given tinned baby food! Buzzers elicited no response. After a huge unexplained delay with no food or water for the children we were allowed on the plane. The food situation was disorganised and haphazard-the food was awful. The missed connections were covered but there was more waits for hotels and transport etc. After all the fuss we got about 2 hours sleep before our connecting flight the next day. The two trips that were better were shorter (6.5 hours) and had less people on them. On both these trips we got help from an excellent nanny and some good service from that person. On one of these trips we got champagne but this was after my finger got jammed in the TV. Food was bad on all trips-seats were poor and the baby not catered for at all.

My SYD-AUH flight was operated by Virgin Australia and was an excellent experience that I will not comment on here. The other three flights were operated by Etihad which were fine enough. AUH-GRU and return was on an A340 - the planes felt a little old but there was plenty of space compared to most economy seats I've been in. However AUH-SYD was on a B777 with quite possibly the worst economy long-haul seat I've experienced. The plane was nice and new and the IFE was excellent but the 3-4-3 layout meant the seat width was very narrow and uncomfortable even for a skinny guy like myself. It was hard to walk up and down the aisles to get to the bathrooms due to lack of space - kept bumping into people and I'm glad I wasn't sitting in an aisle seat otherwise I would have been extremely annoyed by this. Virgin Australia use a 3-3-3 layout on the exact same plane and it was very comfortable. Etihad need to learn something from their partner.

Firstly my outgoing journey to BKK was pretty good - I have no complaints other than the usual for me not enough leg room (I am 6ft 3) however I am yet to fly with any carrier that I wouldn't say this about. The return journey was okay initially the flight left BKK on time and arrived in Abu Dhabi as scheduled. We boarded the Abu Dhabi - Manchester flight about 30 minutes late and were removed from the aircraft because of a 'maintenance issue' about 20 minutes after embarking. We were then told we could 'show our boarding pass to any of the restaurants in the departure lounge and we'd be able to get some food and a drink. Attempting this proved impossible I was told I needed a voucher from Etihad and wouldn't get anything unless I did. So a 25 minute queue for the voucher. Back to get some food. Oh the voucher only entitles me to what? A doughnut and a coffee! A 6.5 hr delay and this is all that was offered I was pretty disappointed and felt like this was in contradiction to Etihad's excellent reputation. We were eventually boarded on a flight some 7hrs later and whilst on-board the crew and staff were very attentive and professional. They provided a great service however the huge delay put a dampener on my return trip.

Flew Singapore to Brisbane in July and from the moment we were ushered from the very average lounge to the gate (only to find flight delayed 1.5hours) things went downhill. Seats extremely small for business class. I am an average size western female and found the business class space tight in comparison to other airlines. Champagne served immediately. After discussing our need to make a tight connection in Brisbane with the cabin crew we were assured each time we enquired (3 during flight) that our daughter would be bought through from economy so we could exit quickly that the ground crew had been notified and that there would be ground crew to assist us to make connection. None of this happened! We fly on average twice per month and will not fly Etihad again!

There was no pre-boarding for families with kids which a few years ago for us was invaluable (with SIA of course). Our last flight Abu Dhabi to Perth today was over booked and an employee stood at the gate and announced ""boarding now"" so it wasn't done in seat order - absolute chaos. A family of 4 with kids under 3 was sat 2 and 2 on opposite sides of the aircraft. Abu Dhabi airport is chaotic and officious (although the Premier Inn for an overnight stay when we had an 8 hr layover outbound was the highlight and very good). The aircraft spent ages taxiing after landing (outbound and inbound) with no communication from the cockpit and likewise our last flight left an hour late with no announcement as to why. The attendant call button is very loud and seems to sound continuously throughout the flight - why can't the volume be turned down or the staff rely on a light? The temperature kept going from hot to cold and back again - very unpleasant. Overall not great and we won't go again - what you see on the advert is definitely not what you get."

Both our flights we had inattentive crew malfunctioning and/or broken seat equipment and IFE weird menu options. When trying to view 'our Network' the IFE the screen simply went blank and showed a white fuzzy box. Looking in the magazine or asking crew members did not make matters better. Offering bags of plastic packaged caramel corn before landing also seemed a bit off for an award winning airline. Both of our flights departed and arrived very very late as well. The only positive for them is the quality of economy class headsets and honestly outside of that the experience on their competition especially Emirates is far superior!

Roy Burgess",,20th July 2014,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,,,1,no,1,I have just completed a 6 week holiday with my wife and had the unfortunate experience of flying Etihad on 4 occasions. The airline promises one thing and delivers another ie: we had a 3hour delay at MEL which meant we missed our connecting flight at Abu Dhabi so had another 2 hour delay which meant we were almost 6 hours late arriving in London. On the return trip we left Dublin nearly 2 hours late which really didn't matter as the flight from Abu Dhabi to MEL was delayed by well over an hour. I found the staff at the airport and onboard rude and not receptive to customers requests. 777-300 - a very cramped uncomfortable and noisy aircraft.

K Jarvis",,15th July 2014,,Business Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,Very disappointed with Etihad planes late on two occasions already and now waiting in a crummy business lounge in Athens with another late plane. They only give one hour's WIFi in what is supposed to be a business class lounge and the place is hot with second rate food and service and in appropriate seating design. Entertainment system was not working in my business class seat on the way over. First world problem I know but you pay a lot for these seats and they knew the seat had issues from previous flights but still put me in it. Just not good enough. Never flying them again.

Anirudh Jain",,15th July 2014,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,,,2,no,4,Highly rated airlines but a totally disappointing experience. Food is really bad and the seats are really tight. Took a return flight from KL to Sao Paulo and for such a long journey the seats were really uncomfortable. Not to mention that the flight was delayed for 3 out of the 4 legs. The change over in Abu Dhabi was a bad experience as well. The change of flight required extensive walking with a 2 hr lay over only and had to go through a long line for x-ray again.

K Matthews",,15th July 2014,,Business Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,2,no,2,MEL to AUH. Flight was late leaving with no explanation. The seat was very uncomfortable being hard and with no support at all. There were no headphones for the inflight AV so this needed to be requested. The sound quality from the headphones was distorted with high pitched noises making listening to anything unpleasant. The flight attendant took orders for dinner which served after midnight local time. The meal was adequate but nothing unusual or noteworthy. After dinner that was the last I saw of any flight attendant until breakfast was served many hours later. For some reason I was overlooked by the flight attendant and received no breakfast in fact I was not even asked if I wanted coffee or water. This would be unacceptable in economy class and certainly is so in business class. The flight attendant did speak to me when he wanted to sell me tax free goods from the catalogue. I will not be booking Etihad again.

Would definitely fly them again everything was immaculate the crew at LHR/AUH and on the aircraft and the aircraft itself. I was sat in coral economy and had more legroom than any carrier I've been on in that class the IFE system was great brilliant selection of TV Films Music games and more. 3 choices of main meal in economy as well as snack service and obviously drinks. You may pay a little more but the service and the airline itself is definitely worth it.

I have flown with Etihad many years maybe not again. I am over six foot in height and I think Etihads seats are made for small people. Manchester to Abu Dhabi and then Bangkok I was very uncomfortable all the way. Asked for extra legroom at Manchester and was told it would be £59 extra to Abu Dhabi and then pay extra again at Abu Dhabi to Bangkok. The food was adequate and TV entertainment average. Being an Etihad gold member I have seen Etihads quality go down. Very disappointed.

Very good value for money quite short connection times but not a problem even though AUH is very busy. Cabin crew immaculately presented and actually looked like they enjoyed their job. Good IFE with great selection of films and it was easy to use. Food and drink was ok although I didn't have the snacks. MY only complaint were the seats they were rock hard and it felt like sitting on a slab of concrete after 6 hours. However that's the only real negative and I would fly with them again.

T Cross",,3rd July 2014,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,,2,no,3,Flew MAN-AUH-BKK all on B777-300. Outbound no particular problems though the food offered was at best average. Inbound a different story. Food poor entertainment system barely worked had to be reset 3 times but the worst - aircraft boarding. At AUH organised boarding no way no young families first no row selection just 1 mad free for all on an almost full aircraft. Total disgrace for a 4* rated airline more like a cheap budget outfit. Not my first choice to get my custom again!

Kay George",,1st July 2014,,Business Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,3,no,3,I travel to Melbourne from Manchester once or twice a year. This was my first trip with Etihad. The chauffeur was excellent but had not been given the correct information as to where to pick me up. Fortunately he sent a text and I found him and was in plenty of time so no worries. Unlike the other airlines I have flown with I did not feel 'looked after'. I have a gluten free diet and at the first meal the cabin crew apologised not only for there being no g/f bread but also for the very tired looking meal. The standard of food was not what I expected. I loved the configuration of the seats affording excellent privacy but was glad I am neither claustrophobic nor overweight. At Abu Dhabi the walk to the gate from the cramped lounge was very long. I felt quite ill and asked for some water to take some painkillers but was told to walk 'downstairs' to buy some. A member of staff eventually produced a bottle of water. The next leg was a repeat of the first apologies for lack of bread (I do not need bread it would have been simpler just to say nothing) and very poor food. However I slept well and there was wifi on board which for me is a huge bonus although there is a cost to this. This flight fell below my previous experiences on the MAN - MEL route.

Frank Simon",,1st July 2014,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,I upped my Pearl Economy ticket to Pearl Business via Etihad bidding. Flew the first leg of my trip home (BKK- AUH). Airplane was one of the older (two class) 777-300ER of Etihad Airways. Seat area layout was ok especially when travelling alone and having one of the separated seats open to the aisle. I would not want to sit in one of the 'couple seats' with a complete stranger. Seat size was below optimum for a 1.88m/6'3'' person like me as in the maximum reclined position I wasn't able to stretch out completely. Putting one leg in the aisle was not causing a problem due to generous space especially when compared to the extremely narrow economy class aisle in 3-4-3 configured 777s. Power sockets and USB-Plug-in were somewhat randomly put into several areas and the table was too far from the person to enjoy the meal in an upright Position. The layout was clearly lacking storage room for something small like earphone case or iphone. No noise suppressing headphones were provided although announced in the ad (Website). I used my own ones and was able to sleep rather comfortably for most of the six hour flight. Food was ok but nothing much to write home about relatively small choice (again not really according to the advertised super cuisine). Overall a nice experience made the second leg in the extremely cramped economy class of a (nevertheless brand new) Airbus A330 of Air Berlin even more painful.

Slark Anthony",,30th June 2014,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,1,no,4,I had to fly urgently from my home in Kathmandu to London and only Etihad had the dates and times I wanted. My flight was EY 11 on 26th June AUH-LHR Economy seat number 23D. It was a Boeing 777. After my last two terrible experiences with the seating I had vowed never to use Etihad again but this time I had no choice. The experience was just as terrible with these ten across tiny seats. It's a shame because the cabin service and meals were as usual excellent. I will be travelling by Qatar Airways Oman Air or Air India whenever possible in the future and I will use Etihad as a last resort.

I got the old seat from AUH-SYD and you can definitely see the improvement. Food was good. Other airlines do offer a bigger Menu. Lounge in Terminal 3 AUH very disappointing too small and at Peak times standing room only. Etihad's main competition Emirates offer a better overall product. Etihad are trying to keep up with Emirates. They are trying to grow very quickly but missing some of the simple little things that make a great airline such as Singapore or Emirates.

The Business Class product is excellent except for the smaller A320 aircraft. Very old and dingy interior. The Flagship Business Class Lounge in Abu Dhabi in the mornings is a complete joke. This lounge is something you'd except from a 1 star airline. I did though have the pleasure to experience the lounge mid-morning and it was very pleasant. Staff even remember my face from previous visits and coffee choice. The Etihad Chauffeur is also fantastic along with the dedicated Business/First check-in. Cannot fault this airline and it will continue to be my airline of choice!

David Feehan",,23rd June 2014,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,,3,no,5,"Flew with MAN-AUH-NRT and back. Flights to and from MAN were on 777-300. These planes are very cramped in 3-4-3 configuration. That said staff were courteous and the food perfectly acceptable. However the perennial problems with delays leaving Manchester reared their ugly head (apparently waiting for passengers from a connecting flight which has arrived some time before the scheduled departure). This resulted in a mad dash transferring through AUH to get my connection to NRT. Flights to and from NRT were on A330 which seemed much more spacious in terms of legroom. As the flight to NRT was half-empty there was plenty of room to stretch out. Arrival at NRT spoilt by the non-arrival of my baggage. Credit where it's due the Etihad representative was straight on the phone to track it down but this has happened to about 12 people on the flight. Even more disturbing the Etihad rep had told me that it happened to 7 people the day before. Service on the flight was perfectly acceptable but the delays and transit issues at AUH and temporary lost baggage spoilt the ""Etihad Experience"" for me."

At check-in we were changed to BC seat with no explanation nor would they change it. Seat A was occupied and plane only 60% full. After takeoff I moved to vacant aisle seat with no one beside me. Mid flight a stewardess pushed 2 more into the seats next to me. Why as there were other vacant seats? I checked our original seat allocation and found 1 child under 5 occupying both A/C seats with parents in aisle seat with 2 spare seats next to them. That's unbelievable. Terrible flight and can't believe how poor seat allocation is. I will not fly Etihad again.

Food and wine top notch and loved the fact you can eat when you want and what you want. The beds are narrow but comfortable. The only gripe is that the lounge in Abu Dhabi is dreadful. Its overcrowded and too small. To say this is their signature lounge is a joke. Passengers were sitting on the floor as there were not enough seats! This is part of the flight experience but its letting the product down big time.

Flight attendants were ok but they were quite peculiar about giving you more water. Being on planes for more than 15+ hours one gets dehydrated. Clean up after meals were too slow. It took them more than half an hour to come back and collect the rubbish. Transiting through Abu Dhabi was horrible. They make you go through security again and on our flight back to Melbourne we had to go through security twice. Boarding and transiting logistics needs to be looked at it's it not streamlined overlaps and absolutely chaotic. Other than the transiting in Abu Dhabi flight was pleasant.

S Neela Sukhanya",,29th May 2014,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,,,1,no,1,On our outward trip from Abu Dhabi to Johannesburg I was allocated seat no 22c and my husband was allocated seat no 22a next to me but for reasons unknown ground staff decided to change my husbands seat to 26g. This was done without consulting us. Assuming that the passenger seated next to me must have made a specific request for that seat I was surprised to learn from her that she has made no such request. When I pointed this out to the air hostess she was apologetic though it was not her fault. For a flight of 9 hours my husband and I were made to sit apart. On our return from Johannesburg to Abu Dhabi we a group of 9 adults who are strict vegetarians had to make do with bread and juice and a couple of packets of nuts as our meal request for avml or asian vegetarian meal was not showing in their system. To sum it up our experience with Etihad was bad and the only saving grace was the air hostesses who were very considerate.

Last time 27th April I was rescheduled Manchester to Heathrow to Bangkok. I was assured there was ample time to transfer from T1 to T3 LHR .Not so had to dash only made it because BKK flight was delayed. I do not need such stress. Now the return leg on 18th May from BKK to AUH. No member of cabin staff identified me as a gold member each request was declined and the stewardess was totally out of her depth. for example when I asked for a glass of dessert wine I was told I would have to wait until business class was finished and see if there was any left. One hour and 25 mins later it arrived. By such time I had lost the will to complain . On the flight from AUH to MAN I was boarding with business class passengers . As I entered the aircraft the cabin crew manager said to the gentleman in front 'lovely to see you again sir through to the right' - to myself ""in there to the left"" with a look of disdain then to the next two behind lovely to see you etc. As a frequent flier and gold card holder I feel the treatment I received was abysmal."

On the SYD to AUH flight I had a live crawling beetle in my salad. I alerted cabin crew who attempted to remove it and return my salad to me! After following up the whole flight she finally said she had submitted an incident report. On the AUH to MAN flight the cabin staff gave our vegetarian meal to the family behind us. They started eating it and then the staff realised they had made a mistake so they removed the meal from the family behind us and gave it straight to us. The staff never returned when we requested water and it usually took 3 or 4 times until we got water. When I laid a complaint to the head office they offered my free guest miles and we stand by our great service and are offering you these guest miles. And that was it.

They have messed up my domestic flight timings with out even considering that it is prepaid already. The only solution Etihad Airways could engage was to persuade me into cutting my trip short or make it longer which I cant .The other solution Etihad encouraged me to partake was giving me a full refund. Its so easy for Etihad Airways to dump a customer off the cliff. Happily they try so hard to take your money when a deal is made but engaging in solution is something you are poor at. I work full time. I am an employee who has to make precise schedule to make that once in a life time trip to see his family in a short notice. Very disappointed!

But the staff service I received from Etihad Airways was so bad that I am writing this immediately after my travel. I was travelling with my 1 year old daughter and was surprised by the attitude of the Air Hostesses and other cabin staff. They were least friendly and least helpful when you ask them anything. I needed some help with my bags to be put in the compartments above the seat and I asked a staff to help me as I had my daughter who was not very happy either. But I was told point blank that she cannot carry my bags. During the flight I asked for some warm milk for my daughter and the staff gave a cup of cold milk (after asking a couple of times). When I asked if they can help me get the milk warmed I was again told clearly that that is all they can do and they can't warm the milk. Then I had to request them a few times to finally get the milk warmed. I am just putting down a couple of things here. But the experience was bad to worse and it all had to do with an unfriendly and unhelpful staff.

Aspi Dubash",,20th May 2014,,Business Class,,,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,,,1,no,1,My wife and myself went to Colombo airport and got checked in for a flight to Munich via Abu Dhabi. The flight was in the initial beginning was late by one hour. The Etihad ground staff knew about this problem but still issued us both the Boarding Passes Colombo to Abu Dhabi and Abu Dhabi To Munich. On the flight we asked the Purser and the Air Hostess to check with the Pilot about our connecting flight in Abu Dhabi. All three assured us that we will be able to catch the connecting flight. Upon landing at Abu Dhabi airport we were met by a Etihad ground staff who told us that the connecting flight had left for Munich 1.5 hours ago. So all that assurance by the Pilot and the Purser was a lie. We were made to do immigration formalities and brought to the baggage collection carousel. The baggage took exactly one hour and twenty minutes to arrive. We were not offered any water nor a place to sit no one was kind nor helpful at the airport. We were handed over to Etihad Airways staff who was the rudest I have ever known. Just because she is of Arab origin she thought that everybody else are low down. She took us to the taxi rank at the airport and handed us over to a taxi driver who drove us off to Dubai. She also told us that there will a person from Etihad who will take care of us at the Dubai Terminal. Finally we reached Dubai Emirates Business Terminal and got ourselves checked in. What a difference from the Emirates Staff compared to the Etihad staff. Nobody at Etihad Airways cared a damn and they were not bothered.

The staff there was quite rude and unprofessional.

D Pluck",,12th May 2014,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,,3,no,3,"We had 4 flights with them and all 4 were late one by as much as 11 hours. Not a good start! With regard to the longest delay we were put into a ""first class hotel"". I do not call Premier Inn first class! We were told that we would have a chauffeur car to get there. After a 30 minute wait we ascertained that the hotel was some 200 metres away so we walked having wasted half an hour. On the return flight to Heathrow we witnessed a blatant disregard to the general safety regulations when a young female continued to occupy a seat next to an emergency door when it was very obvious that she would have been unable to carry out the special duties that pertain to that position. Finally quite a proportion of inflight entertainment units were inoperable."

Hignett Harry",,11th May 2014,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,EY16 Manchester to Abu Dhabi on 14th April. Business class. Arriving Abu Dhabi there was no gangway we had to disembark using metal steps. There was no handrail and I aged 87 I had difficulty using the steps with very little to help me to climb down. At the same time an elderly lady perhaps not as old as myself but using a walking stick also had difficulty going down to ground level. There ought to have been a handrail. Thursday 1st May on my return at Sydney airport I attempted to find the Business class lounge prior to boarding EY455 Sydney to Abu Dhabi. I walked almost the length to Gate 60 before I found that it was near the Duty Free section. I had waked past with a number of people. The signing was poor and needed an overhead indication. On 3rd May EY021 Abu Dhabi to Manchester I asked for grilled beefsteak from the main menu only to be informed that it was not available. The alternative from the Anytime Menu was adequate. At all times the staff were extremely efficient pleasant and helpful.

Khan Muhammad",,11th May 2014,,Business Class,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,,1,no,3,I flew Etihad on 9 March 2014 from LHE-AUH-IAD. My trip started horribly from LHE where the Pearl and coral lanes were not even separated ground staff had no interest towards assisting anyone. It took them 2 hours to give me my boarding pass and they gave me an aisle seat when I had checked in online with a window seat. The plane was 1 hour late and when I entered the cabin only 1 flight attendant was there to guide everyone to their seats. No welcome drink served not even water. After take off the flight attendant brought me someone else's meal and then repeated the same thing again. It was a short flight and had a longer journey ahead. When I arrived at AUH airport I was happy to see they had extended their terminals and new terminals have been added to the airport. After clearing the security check point I went to the Pearl lounge and was so disappointed that there was nowhere to sit. I went to the new US Immigration's and Customs area which was done very well. The flight was an hour late. 14 hours to DC was ok the flight was full so I couldn't get my seat again. I was very disappointed with their inflight entertainment system as it has nothing at all to watch or listen to. Food quality was ok. Landed at IAD and my limo was not ordered as per the agent at the IAD airport. The bottom line is I have been travelling Qatar Airways for the past 4 years and they are excellent when it comes to taking care of their business class passengers. I hope Etihad improves.

Jeanine Whalley",,11th May 2014,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,Melbourne to Seychelles via Abu Dhabi and it was a pretty average flight small seat pitch mediocre food only one drink served on a 13 hour flight. The way home however was a different story. On 27th April the plane took off from the Seychelles 5 hours late due to fog in Abu Dhabi. I knew I would miss my connecting but assured that ground staff in Abu Dhabi had it taken care of. When we arrived there was no sense of order or anywhere near enough staff. On arrival at 11.10pm I was told to queue at the flight transfer desk. At this point there were two people working the desk. The queue broke up and it became a free for all. After 3 hours of waiting in this queue I was rebooked on a flight to Sydney and then another one on to Melbourne the following day. I arrived in Sydney to find my luggage was not with me. I had obviously missed my next flight so was rebooked again and found myself back in Melbourne 17 hours later than intended. I finally got my luggage 4 days later.

The seats were very narrow and made you feel claustrophobic due to the 3-4-3 configuration however the comfort of the seat was good the seats also looked very attractive. The aisles were very narrow and small. The value for money was great the legroom was decent and the staff service was average. My mother asked for headphones 3 times until someone bothered to fulfil her request. She asked for water a several times and a Air Hostess looked annoyed and gave her a whole bottle. Their attitude needs some sorting out. The food and beverages were great and the IFE was very good too!

Last minute plans from Etihad was made which annoyed me a bit. The cabin seriously needs refurbishing it looks old and worn out inside. The seat comfort was decent and the legroom was good. The cabin crew were rushed and some were kind and some were moody. The value for money was great! The IFE was good and the food and beverages was great!

When the flight finally took off we we're allowed to use the IFE and the IFE was pretty good. The cabin crew were all a bit moody and rushed which wasn't very helpful at all. The seat comfort was decent and the legroom was good. I liked the configuration of 2-4-2. The meal was also decent.

We flew on a Boeing 777-300ER A6-ETL And the configuration of the Coral Economy Class seats were 3-4-3 it made you feel very claustrophobic. It was a struggle to get luggage through the tiny little narrow aisles. To be different from flying the regular PIA we chose Etihad as it was cheaper. The cabin crew were all very nice and kind the seat had very good comfort. The legroom was okay the in-flight entertainment was quite good!

Holger Rosemann",,5th May 2014,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,FRA to SGN in May 2014. Excellent food at any time during the flight. All meals were served with nice silverware and almost to 1st class standard of other airlines. You can choose any course and combination as much as you like and whenever you like. Excellent in-between-meals and they even reserve you your favourite main dish if you decide to eat later. Toilets are cleaned multiple times. I am 196cm tall and still could sleep on 100% flat beds. Entertainment a bit limited but headphones comfortable. Amenities bag complete with socks ear plugs hand and face moisturiser tooth brush and toothpaste of high quality. Most importantly and above all: the staff including ground staff in the lounges and check-in in FRA and AUH. I have never been in a better lounge then the Etihad lounge in FRA (except may be the Lufthansa HON lounge in FRA but that is a different world of it's now).

Flying First and Business class - the worst experience I have had on an airline. Delayed 2 hours at Heathrow (no reason given) had to go on a later flight from Abu Dhabi to Bangkok again delayed 2 hours each time we were just sat on the plane waiting. Service on the plane very poor. Although no delays on return service was very poor again. Seemed like air crew had no interest in passengers only their own comfort. Staff in airport lounges disinterested with very rude tone.

Cordelia Williams",,3rd May 2014,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,I flew First Class from LHR-AUH-SIN-BNE and back again. I must say the service was excellent. Our steward was very attentive and only wanted to please. The food was excellent although I did expect breakfast to be served a bit earlier on when flying from SIN-BNE. I was slightly disappointed with the Inflight Entertainment system. It was not as good as British Airways simply because there was not as much choice. On the return journey it seemed like I had watched everything twice over. However I rather liked how the system did not turn off when the plane was beginning it's descent as it often does with other airlines. The steward was very helpful when it came to disembarking the plane. I was struggling to unload all my things and manage to my two young boys. He took my boys and led them off the plane. This is my first time travelling Etihad normally I would use BA or Cathay Pacific but I have converted over to Etihad now! Overall the best flight experience I have had. I fly at least once a month to AUH business class and every six months I fly First to Australia and will definitely be using Etihad for my future travels.

A mother and child of 4 had been allocated seats apart which is appalling and we were asked by cabin crew if we would change seats with them just for take off as the little boy was upset. Deceitful cabin crew wouldn't let us return to our seats and we had to sit apart for the whole journey. Dishonest and conniving complained to Etihad they don't want to know.

AJ Nathan",,25th April 2014,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,3,no,4,"Flew ORD-MAA-ORD in March/April this year. The good: Food and drink choices were very good inflight crew did they best they could. Entertainment system is among the best. The bad: Cramped seating on 10 abreast 777-300. Some airlines increase seat pitch in this configuration but Etihad still uses 31"" pitch. This was unbearable especially on the 15 hour flight from Abu Dhabi to Chicago. No concept of boarding zones. All 4 flights were delayed by at least 1 hour. Connecting in Abu Dhabi is a nightmare. They make you go through security just before boarding which is a primary reason for delays. Buses take passengers to smaller planes. Too many passengers are packed into one bus for a very uncomfortable 20 minute ride. Neutral: US CBP pre-clearance is nice to have but adds to delays. It was already past departure time when passengers were in the US Immigration line. All Etihad flights from Abu Dhabi to the US are delayed by at least 2 hours because of this."

The seats were so uncomfortable and only acceptable if you are a sardine the food was awful and the air crew were very unprofessional. We have flown with Thai and Eva Air who were fantastic.

This is second time with us that Etihad failed to provide service as they promise. My family are still at Abu Dhabi airport wondering when their flight will be.

E Shields",,14th April 2014,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,4,I have done several long haul flights with Etihad. I am satisfied with most aspects of their service. However on my last trip I waited 90 minutes in a very slow moving queue to check my luggage in at Sydney and another 90 minutes on the return journey waiting to check in at CDG Paris. I wonder if the airline is cost cutting with check in staff. Then there is the issue of the queue at Abu Dhabi. After alighting the aircraft it is necessary to stand amid a slowly moving sea of humanity all awaiting a re-scanning of hand luggage. On my last trip this wait took over an hour. After a fourteen hour flight it sure takes some stamina. I am thinking of changing airlines.

Colin Dale",,9th April 2014,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,,,1,no,1,I was scheduled to fly from BKK through AUH to LHR. Etihad run a 'tight' connection at AUH and on this last trip the whole process was a shambles. Their flight into BKK was very late and Etihad suggested that we would not make the AUH connection to LHR. I spent a lot of time (and money) on calls trying to resolve commitments in the UK accordingly. In the end rather than pay for accommodation and similar for (I estimate) 100 passengers they simply made the AUH flight wait two hours and thus inconvenienced over 300 passengers! Investigating their schedules and the way they handle their aircraft (in this case A6ETB) it was clear that they had elected to deliberately run this aircraft late for three consecutive days. When I say late I mean hours not minutes: you can imagine the difficulties that passengers face arriving at LHR and getting out around 10 pm at night rather than at 7 pm. I would and urge everyone who is considering using Etihad to be quite careful they may have an equipment shortage or simply be electing to mess people around as they know that there is limited legislation for a non-EU airline of this nature.

A Joyce",,8th April 2014,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,Dublin - Abu Dhabi - Bangkok return economy March 2014. Frequent Flyer and Etihad gold card holder. Etihad are a good but no longer great airline. All flights were punctual. The lounge in Dublin is fantastic. All flight sectors were very busy. Food onboard was OK. The food service onboard seems to take an extortionate amount of time. Also Etihad leave the main lighting on for too long on red eye flight. They should make better use of the mood lighting for those that want to sleep. The seat pitch on the A330 was not good and I could not sleep. The Boeing 777 aircraft with 10 abreast seating and narrow aisles feels cramped but easier to sleep on. The crew were friendly and professional on all sectors. They currently appear to be more interactive and helpful with passengers. I was impressed as I was greeted by name on one sector. IFE is good. Etihad now seem to have a policy of boarding almost an hour before scheduled departure which seems excessive to me. We were sitting on the tarmac after boarding for a least 30minutes on all sectors and I was one of the last few to board. There are still issues with the landing slot in Dublin airport in the morning as no stands are available to park at. Another delay after a 8 hour flight.

In AUH at the Business Class desk I complained and asked to receive the correct boarding pass for the flight at 2.20 am that I was booked on. They told me that the flight was fully booked and that it was not possible to get me on the flight not even in Economy class.

Etihad being the national carrier for the UAE have had fierce competitors but have not let it degrade their service. With polite and efficient staff you're welcomed with lush cuisine well presented stewards/stewardesses all topped off with a great entertainment system. Check in was extremely fast boarding was a breeze and cruising was pleasant. Meals are plentiful and delicious with two choices at hand and an additional vegetarian option. Seat comfort and recline brilliant. The airline in my opinion is one of the best. I look forward to flying with them again.

I've traveled in all 3 cabins never have I not been satisfied. The service is the best the entertainment system is excellent toilets are always clean and seats are comfortable. Last trip I had was on EY18 from London to Abu Dhabi in business class. The lounge in London was the best lounge I've been to following the one in Abu Dhabi. Onboard I was in seat 9A a window seat and being able to lay down flat is great. I slept then woke up for an excellent meal. The plane had wifi connection I was able to use whatsapp throughout the flight. The only bad thing was the main course that wasn't that good I miss their steak sandwiches.

T Mirza",,7th April 2014,,Business Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,,3,no,1,Mumbai-London-Mumbai Pearl (Business) Class. The tiny plane from BOM-AUH (courtesy Jet Airways) did not feel anything special other than a slightly stretched economy seat. The Business class lounge at AUH felt stuffy scruffy and least inviting. Couches were occupied by sleeping passengers and food was so spartan it made a mockery of a proper business class lounge. At boarding there was no special fast track for Business Class travelers and we simply had to wait in a long queue. During long haul sections the standard business class stretch seat and cabin did not quite infuse a sense of special feeling and the cabin attendants were barely doing their routine duties and food was no more than ordinary. Really very disappointed. The distinct feeling is the Business Class has been washed down these days to be nothing special even though the price compared is almost 3 times that of economy class.

A Bernier",,3rd April 2014,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,,,1,no,1,I traveled several times with them and each time has been a nightmare. Flights being delayed for 4 to 5 hours is common. Last time I flew out of Kuwait the lady at check-in told me: Sorry Sir but the flight is delayed. 2.5 hrs on a 90 minute flight. Of course I was not offered any voucher not even for a drink of water! The worst was my recent flight to Morocco from Abu Dhabi. The flight scheduled to leave at 2 am finally left at 7 am. Not a single announcement was made to inform passengers or to guide them to some desk to get assistance or a voucher. Up to 7 am the airline's website kept listing the departure on time at 2 am. The company was not to blame with the delay the airport was experiencing a failure of the lighting system on the runways. The Etihad service desks were swamped with stranded passengers needing to be rebooked. It was madness to try to get to the desks. Etihad staff was trying their best not to been seen. No attempt was made to bring order to chaos. Things did not get any better once I finally arrived in Morocco. Being so late I had missed my connection. No help from Etihad no one in the airport to guide passengers and assist them.

But my last 3 flights with them have lacked heavily with poor customer service 7 hours flight delay in Abu Dhabi and staff didn't provide any quality information unfriendly staff at gate 59 that day last month. Great customer service by staff in Australia and Germany but the UAE headquarters in Abu Dhabi is the one that pulls down the whole airline performance. Seats are still great and entertainment is ok but could be updated a little. Always flying MEL-TXL-MEL. Staff members wake you up while sleeping only to ask you if you want to have dinner. Thinking about doing future travel with Qatar airways.

I was told that I must choose one or the other. Business class surely costs enough to cover this. My first meal consisted of a starter - a chicken breast and a main course - another chicken breast! I decided that there was sufficient choice on the main menu to find suitable options. I felt that I was paying enough to be given a gluten free choice. The entertainment was really poor for European travellers.

There were not many facilities provided for infants I was traveling with my 2 year old nephew. I disliked that the food was served very late.

Edward Cowie",,30th March 2014,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,,,1,no,1,Brisbane to London Heathrow. March 28/29. This is the second time we've used this airline the first being Business Class to and from Australia from London last year. Our overall feelings? The reputation of the airline as 'the best' seems to us to reflect (if true) on how bad other airlines must be though our experience of Emirates flights London/Melbourne have always been better. We had ample airmiles for upgrade on one leg back but were told these classes were 'sold-out' which on observation passing the seats on exit was patently not the case! The Etihad seats for a tall man like me are a nightmare no way to get a headrest into high position to rest head. The space is confined and restrictive. Although Silver Guest card holders we were never advised that we could book actual seats well before the 24 hour on line service. Whilst many of the aircrew really are very nice some are poor at communicating. The food? Well this time much worse than before mostly inedible and boring. I'm afraid we feel this airline is terribly overrated and will never travel with them again.

Excellent flight with very attentive service comfortable seats and good inflight entertainment. 2nd leg of journey from Abu Dhabi quite poor in comparison. At Abu Dhabi airport was sent to the wrong lounge and no one seemed to have information on our flight details. Lounge very busy. Once onboard the flight staff initially helpful but that soon wore off. Was offered a drink which I accepted only to have it taken away unfinished with no explanation. Obviously an older plane not the one shown on the website and the seats were a bit worn. I hadn't realised that the flight was with an Etihad partner Virgin. I chose to travel business class for the reason that Etihad have flat beds some help with how to flatten them would have been good. Most people sleeping presume this was the reason there was no meal offered? I had to ask for breakfast I don't really consider a bowl of cornflakes a round of toast or a steak sandwich on a 13 hour flight acceptable. The cost of this flight was £3400 I could probably have a few nights in a five star hotel for that. I have my return journey home in a couple of weeks can't say I'm looking forward to it!

Families had been separated and ground staff had no clue how to resolve and were just inept. Boarding chaotic with no order. Shame as once on board and off the ground the cabin staff were excellent. Nothing was too much trouble. Food good - a snack bag to start with (flight left around 3am) and then hot breakfast prior to arrival. Good entertainment system. Seats somewhat cramped - they get in an extra seat across a 777 like Emirates - and seat pitch average. Good fares. Need to improve the quality of ground staff at Abu Dhabi as this spoils a good product in the air especially their cabin staff. Worth considering.

Joe Kaiser",,30th March 2014,,First Class,,,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,9,I had flown Etihad business class from Chicago to Abu Dhabi and I rated it as very uncomfortable in fact one of the worst BC seats ever flown. On the return I did first class from Abu Dhabi to New York and the experience was outstanding. The seat was extremely comfortable and the service outstanding. The food was good and varied while the privacy doors around the seat were perfect for a 14 hour trip. I was extremely happy and wish more of the international airlines (American carriers will never get their act together) would provide similar first class experience. I look forward to my next visit to UAE and I will avoid the connection through Chicago and instead use NY.

M Baker",,29th March 2014,,Business Class,,,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,,,2,no,1,SYD-AUH EY 455 5th March. AUH-MAN EY 021 planned departure 6th March actual 7th March. Our major points of contention with the airline and Abu Dhabi airport are: Poor or non existent communication with any of the passengers poor or non existent communication between various members of staff inconsistency of information especially on the airport display boards rudeness from some of the staff (ground crew) although many were polite friendly and tried to calm passengers as much as possible. Abu Dhabi airport does look very impressive from the outside (viewed due to need to use a transit hotel in the city) the duty free/shopping area looks smart and there is a good deal of high tech equipment but: it is small and cramped for the number of passengers travelling through even if the flights are on time staff are either incompetent or badly trained. Communication with passengers is abysmal - PA announcements are limited and the display boards are very inaccurate. The abudhabiairport.ae website is inaccurate and not kept up to date catering facilities would make a small village shopping centre look impressive - and they do not cater for either the volume of passengers or offer them much by way of choices. The idea of queuing in order to get into a departure gate lounge is pathetic at the least and you do not make passengers queue for over an hour just to get to this point. On the plane the service started well with a very attractive stewardess taking our food order but after that they all disappeared. We are used to cabin crew walking thru regularly to check on passengers but with Etihad you have to use the call button! We would not recommend Etihad.

They are very sturdy and you unfortunately need to give it your all for a recline no wonder some people say you can't recline on their Y seats.

Angelika Melani",,27th March 2014,,Business Class,,,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,,,2,no,3,BKK-AUH-DUS in Business. The flight from BKK to AUH was uneventful however in Abu Dhabi the transfer was horrible bad signage arrogant and unfriendly assistance and than the overrated F Class Lounge. The check in to DUS was a complete nightmare there were other flights as well departing from the same lounge nobody really understood what's going to happen. Our flight delayed by hours. Than finally boarding no delays anymore. There was no communication at all. Transfer to aircraft via bus. Inflight entertainment did not work the breakfast served was not eatable at all. On my return journey to Australia I selected a different airline.

Waited 56 minutes to disembark appeared to be problems getting buses from plane to terminal. Abu Dhabi airport taking far too long with its improvements many less experienced travelers would not tolerate the waiting and misinformation. Being a gold member having very little advantage in Abu Dhabi.

J Huang",,17th March 2014,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,no,5,IAD-BKK (via AUH) round-trip. IAD-AUH (A340-600) - flight only 20% full and I had the bulkhead seat with an open seat next to me. Had a great experience with in-flight food entertainment and service. I chalk that up to the empty flight and minimal stress on FA's. Bulkhead seats are normally 75$ per leg but was able to get it during online check-in. Bulkhead had plenty of legroom and you don't have to worry about reclining seats. IFE is slightly smaller and with lower graphics quality. Cons: seats are quite hard halfway through the 12 hr flight my tailbone was so sore I had to sit on a pillow for the rest of trip. Transit AUH - first time at airport and transit in evening was a breeze with minimal lines for transfer/secondary security. I had a short layover so didn't check on the facilities. Food options are limited and expensive. AUH-BKK (777) - completely full flight and boarding process was very chaotic. Basically a complete free for all boarding. They boarded by rows but gate agents were not enforcing it. I will avoid flying on 777 especially with the 3-4-3 set up and the poor seat pitch. Cabin was very hot even though I was just in a T-shirt. FA's did their best scrambling around with the full flight. Seats again were very hard and not comfortable. BKK-AUH (777) - same experience as the inbound flight. Cabin too warm and breakfast food was pretty bad on this flight. By far the worse on the trip. Boarding in BKK still very chaotic. AUH transit with US Customs pre-clearance - 3 hour layover in the early morning and airport was very busy. Secondary security had long lines and had to wait 30 min. Food options is still terrible. US pre clearance at AUH was a mixed bag. No dedicated lines for US citizens. AUH-BKK (A340) - another full flight and a complete reversal in my Etihad experience. FA had difficult time communicating with mostly South Asian customers. Meal service was a zoo - I have never seen so many different special meal requests. There's a 30-40 min lag between special meal service and regular meal service. Special meal customers ended up holding on their meals for 1 hr. Some flyers had to take their own tray back to the FA. Cabin temperature fluctuated a couple times from cold to warm. IAD luggage took forever. Waited for a full 30 min at the carousel from the first bag to my bag. Probably would not fly Etihad economy even with the lowest price. Seat pitch way too small for intl long hauls. AUH transit was not very pleasant with lines everywhere and terrible food options.

All my flights to and from Melbourne were punctual clean efficient and more comfortable than expected given I was in Coral Economy Class. I have been on long haul flights with a number of airlines to India and USA and I must say that I was most impressed by Etihad and would recommend this Company. The cabin staff were exemplary in meeting the needs of all their guests treated everyone with respect and yet made me feel like a special individual. My only reservation is that if you seat at the back of the plane the menu choices can run out. However it is possible to pre-book a meal from a drop down list when booking.

Flight supposed to be delayed for departure from Manila for 2 hours which ended to be 3.5. I lost my connection to Dusseldorf and ended up in a queue along with at least 500 people from other flights and different connections lost. There was no type of prioritization communication from staff and they were totally lost. We were standing in the queue for 5 hours looking at the staff behind the counter. When I reached the counter I kept hearing ""one minute sir one minute"" for about an hour before getting a new reservation for connections the next morning at 4 am so 20 hours later. I then went to terminal 1 since I had to take my boarding pass from there the guy could not print them from Terminal 3. Went there sat in another queue for half an hour just to be told that I was at the wrong counter to get boarding passes for Turkish airlines and I should move to another. There are no signs whatsoever and no people that could provide useful information. It is acceptable to miss a connection it happens everywhere but the level of incompetence and lack of interest in Abu Dhabi is just ridiculous. Not flying Etihad again."

The Pearl experience from start to finish was excellent with a couple of caveats UK chauffeur each way all on time and friendly. Check in and lounge at MAN easy and helpful. Food and drink in lounges plentiful apart from BNE where the lounge is operated by NZ airways and the am food choice limited. The men's lavatory was in need of cleaning and refreshing. In flight al a carte of a good standard as was the anytime kitchen on all legs. Both MAN and AUH lounges can be congested as has been mentioned. A request for a special wheat free diet didn't really work as the two courses offered on the first meal serving were chicken starter followed by chicken main. My companion reverted to ordering off the main menu for all other meals. Gluten free bread was not offered. Transfers at AUH were not clear for fast track passengers and there's no lounge or fast track at all in Singapore on the stop over. Flat beds comfortable I'm 180cm tall and slept well. No jet lag to worry about. IFE not the best particularly western music Mainly B rate films although I found enough to watch. In all a very good experience and would use again.

N Willmott",,7th March 2014,,Business Class,,,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,3,no,1,LHR-AUH-LHR in business class. Started badly as the chauffeur service decided to park round the corner of my building and not tell anyone it took 30 minutes of trying to contact the airline before we finally found them. Got to the airport my flight was more than an hour late due to late inbound equipment. Flight out was okay I had very high expectations as this was my first time with Etihad and I had heard great things. Return flight forget about it. I'm stuck in the mess at Abu Dhabi airport at the moment where technical problems closed the airport briefly. The customer service systems have totally different (and unrealistic) information versus the departure boards in the lounge. Staff are overwhelmed. If you are connecting through this part of the world stick with Emirates I will in the future.

Sink in main bathroom was blocked and this reported to crew. The same aircraft serviced the AUH-Melbourne sector. The sink was still blocked. This airline has some excellent staff however the standards are extremely uneven and one is left with the impression that training could be improved.

David de Klerk",,3rd March 2014,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,3,no,4,BRU-AUH-KUL and back. Service on board and staff were very good. The seats were very narrow on the first flight but much better on the airplane leased from Jet Airways. The food was quite tasty and the IFE was acceptable. But the transit at Abu Dhabi was terrible. The airport wants to play with the big boys but it lacks the facilities to do so. Way too many passengers than they can handle so extremely long queues. It took me two hours just to get from one plane to the other. Long bus rides from the plane to the terminal and vice versa. Wifi doesn't work properly. I thought Etihad was quite good but because of Abu Dhabi airport I am not going to fly with Etihad again. Next time I will take Emirates or Qatar Airways to go to Kuala Lumpur.

Laurence McCarthy",,26th February 2014,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,KUL-AUH-LHR 11/2/14. MAS Golden Lounge in KLIA continues to go downhill. Alcohol now served in a completely separate section near the entrance. You really feel like a leper having to walk all the way through the lounge to get a drink. The lounge even though recently refurbished is dirty and already looks tired. Check In was good but everything else until leaving was very poor as MAS also handle boarding and baggage checks at the gate. KUL-LHR flight superb great food staff service wine and the attention staff give each passenger is impressive. Aircraft interior looked like it had be recently refreshed and that was nice Etihad were starting to look a little tired. So well done there. AUH lounge is a disaster too busy and for a flagship it really let's down one of the best airlines around. Boarding was a mess and we ended up standing (no seats) at the gate for 45 minutes. Flight AUH to LHR great as above save for a child in Economy who decided to scream for most of the flight - but the airline can't be held responsible for the bad behaviour of passengers children. Why do people with children believe it is acceptable to trouble everyone else? All in all another excellent trip marred only by the MAS lounge and the transit through AUH lounge. Definitely recommend Etihad as one of the best - hope that now they do KUL twice daily they will invest in their own lounge at KLIA.

We told her politely that we could not take the other meal choice due to the meat. She replied coldly we should have asked for special meal. We understand that we cannot guarantee to have our choice of meals given a full flight. However the stewardess could told us politely. This is certainly not the service that I expected.

Etihad lounge at Manchester is first class with very attentive staff. Etihad business class seat is a little bit narrow and anyone over 6 foot won't be able to lie flat. All seats have direct access to the aisles. If you want privacy I recommend the window seats. The paired seats are very intimate. Food and beverages very satisfactory as too was the service from the cabin crew. Very basic amenity kit was given. Changing terminals in Abu Dhabi was chaotic. Baggage first off the carousel in Bangkok.

Raymundo Licuanan",,10th February 2014,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,I had been traveling Etihad for the past 3 years twice a year Business Class KWI-AUH-MNL back and forth. Food comfort and cabin crew are superb. Leaves and arrives on time. Now my only issue was when I am flying AUH-KWI. At Abu Dhabi Airport terminal waiting area Business Class passengers were being treated as Economy Class. For the past 2 flights going back to Kuwait I experienced that there is no special or separate bus for Business Class passengers. We were all being mixed with Economy Class passengers on a single bus. Before Business Class passengers always had a separate bus and had priority on boarding the bus and plane. There used to be a lane for Business Class. As I had mentioned for the past 2 flights I had AUH-KWI this does not happen anymore. I am now thinking of going back to Emirates or Qatar Airways on my next flight to Manila.

Guilloteaux Marie-Jose",,7th February 2014,,First Class,,,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,,2,no,3,I have been doing the same trip in 1st class (Seoul-Paris/London-Abu Dhabi-Seoul) with Etihad every year for several years but have seen standards declining sharply in 2013 and 2014. At every boarding I had to actively look for someone so I could hand them my coat. No welcome aboard and guiding to my seat and nobody addresses me by my name anymore. The Champagne used to be Bollinger but has been downgraded to something cheaper. The quality of the food can vary dramatically depending on the skills of the on-board chef. Despite my request for breakfast yesterday I was not woken up in time and had to do without! The worst perhaps is the chauffeur pick-up  which stressed me enormously. Nobody called me to arrange a time for pick-up in London so I had to call the UAE to arrange it myself. They did not send any text message or email confirmation despite another call to request it. The pick-up was confirmed (orally) for 6.30 am but I was woken up by the driver at 5.15 am. My flight was at 10.30 am and I was a 15 minute-drive away from the airport! On the next leg of the journey Etihad left me a message that a pick-up had been arranged for me in Dubai but the time turned out to be less than 3 hours before take-off and it takes at least 90 minutes to go from Dubai to Abu Dhabi if there is no traffic. It took me countless calls to Etihad. Luckily the driver came on time. All in all I do not envisage traveling 1st class with Etihad again.

N Henshall",,31st January 2014,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,Manchester-Singapore-Sydney via Abu Dhabi. First time flying with Etihad and impressed with their service. Planes are modern and the seats in cattle class are acceptable. The in-flight entertainment is ok but not spectacular being too limited in content for long haul. Emirates are better in this context. Abu Dhabi is not one of the better airports to change through and isn't well organised. Each time involved a bus trip to the aircraft. I think it is an airline trying to climb up the ladder and the service was the standout. I would happily use them again.

Abu Dhabi is perhaps not the best hub to transfer through but the Etihad aeroplanes are up to date well serviced and the staff are friendly and competent if not outstanding. Travelling with a child on this airline was a breeze and they have special staff roles and extra services to help with kids.

Justin Flynn",,29th January 2014,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,Business class MEL-AUH then economy AUH-LHR. Business class LHR-AUH and again J class from AUH-MEL. Originally booked the entire trip in economy but bidded using Etihad's online upgrade auction that is sent out to select customers. I was successful in all 3 bids. Quick note about economy - the 777-300ER aircraft used a 3-4-3 seating as a lot of airlines are doing these days. The seating is horrible and a massive step down from J of course. Leg room was just adequate. The business class legs were great. The individual 'suites' are very private although the window seats are better and more private than the aisle seats. Seat was comfortable and very comfortable when in 'relax' mode. My only complaint was the bed. Fully reclined the bed is 185cm and I am 184cm. There is no scope for letting your feet hang out over the end of the bed. For a premium product the bed simply isn't long enough for someone who only slightly above average in height. However due to some careful manoeuvring I did manage to get plenty of sleep. Overall the airline was fantastic although transiting between terminals in Abu Dhabi is a pain. The food and service from the cabin crew were wonderful and all flights were on time except or the AUH-MEL leg which was one hour late. The Arabic mezze I had for starters on each J leg was excellent and the lamb shanks were restaurant quality. I didn't drink much alcohol but on the MEL-AUH they had a very nice shiraz that I enjoyed 2 glasses of. Champagne is offered pre takeoff. Amenity kits were basic. The economy section was standard economy. No better no worse and for 7.5 hours wasn't too bad even with a full plane. The trip back from London was very painful for me emotionally as I had lost my mother the day before. The cabin supervisor couldn't have been more helpful.

As the leg from Prague to Abu Dhabi was served by Czech Airlines my comments refer only to the Etihad part. Abu Dhabi Airport needs to improve on signs and information monitors. I guess when switching planes within short time this will be a huge problem. On board the staff were friendly and caring except for the request to increase the temperature. The majority of the passengers were freezing sitting down covered with all available blankets and some even using their winter jackets! This happened on both flights. The food was OK just average airplane food. The entertainment system works well although the screen quality is poor. We usually prefer a long leg without the need for a stop in the middle of the trip so we are unlikely to be re-using this service.

Excellent seat perhaps a little narrow but flat and comfortable for seating and sleeping. Entertainment system very good service excellent very friendly and professional staff. INC-AUH on 340-500 with older business class (the old turquoise seats but recovered with the new stripy fabric clever move Etihad). More cramped and less room but still good for sleeping. No privacy separation between the 2 buddy seats in the middle and if you are not travelling with your companion then it would be embarrassingly close with a shared armrest. Food very good indeed and good wine selection. Would travel again with Etihad. Only negative comment the business class lounge at AUH is overcrowded as it the airport generally. I hope there are plans in place for improvement.

K Abildskov",,15th January 2014,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,,,2,no,2,BRU-AUH-BKK and return in Dec/Jan 2014. Outbound: BRU-AUH: A330 with nice seats good entertainment (this was good on all flights) a good cabin layout friendly crew decent food. Transfer in AUH was a disaster with cramped and chaotic boarding change of gate from T3 to T1 with no announcement. AUH-BKK: B777 with 10 seats per row very small seat pitch extremely cramped. We had paid for exit seats with extra legroom but even these seats were extremely narrow and very uncomfortable/hard. My E-box control would not fit into its socket in so it was just hanging down next to the seat food terrible unfriendly crew. Homebound 20 days later: BKK-AUH: Check-in in Bangkok smooth and friendly same B777 as outbound I think since the e-box control in my seat would still not fit into its socket and was still just hanging down next to the seat. Very friendly crew in our section but the one in the other aisle was not. Sandwiches and breakfast (late night flight). Transfer in AUH again chaotic and disorganised with unfriendly a very cramped boarding lounge bus transfer to plane. AUH-BRU: A330 nice and comfortable plane one hour late probably due to chaotic handling of bus transfers onboard crew friendly. For some reason it was freezing cold on all our Etihad flights and despite promises by the crews to raise the temperature this was not done. Passengers had to sit with two blankets and take extra clothes out of their suitcases. All in all we were really disappointed with Etihad and there is truly a marked decline in standards since just a few years ago.

G Lopez",,15th January 2014,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,Heathrow-Brisbane via Abu Dhabi. This was the 3rd time I've flown Etihad and I could have cut/pasted my complaints from the last two flights. No seat booking with online check-in with code share despite the fact it was Etihad planes on all legs (sold as Virgin on the AD to BNE leg). My inflight entertainment on the first leg wasn't working so I asked for my system to be reset. After several attempts I finally convinced one chap to have a go at resetting it and it worked! Seats are Ryanair-esque reclining so little they might as well have not bothered. Abu Dhabi airport is as chaotic as a market bazaar. No signage small departure screens tucked away from view blank faced overworked staff. On the leg back we were made to sit on the floor while we waited for the gate to open (an hour late). Finally allowed in the departure lounge. Finally told to board the plane bound for London not by the conventional method of a public address system but by a small lady hollering seat numbers at the other end of the departure lounge. Chaos ensued as everyone rushed to the front and the queue again stretched down the gangway. They get a point for landing the plane at the right airport.

Mathew Renosh",,14th January 2014,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,7,JNB-AUH EY601 (A330) Seat: 36A 11/12/2013: Check-in and Boarding was smooth. Seat configuration of 2-4-2 so was seated a row after family as I wanted the seat with the view. Seat is equipped with IFE (E-BOX) headphone jacks a variety of charging docks (USB Power plugs). 10 mins before push back the Captain announced that the flight was experiencing a problems with its power source and a restart of power unit was required. This scenario caused the push back to be delayed 30-40 mins. The front camera in the Flight Map could be used to view the terrain in-front and below during and after take-off. E-BOX had a selection of Movies Audio Live TV (CNN and some news channels) TV (nice documentaries) games etc. There was a decent collection of movies (multiple languages) and documentaries although not as big a variety as ICE on Emirates. The headphone jack on 36B wasn't working so my co-passenger had to move to another seat which gave me 2 seats to relax. Snack and beverages were served 30-60 mins after departure. The main meal was served 2hrs after departure. There were 3 options between Lamb Chicken and Pasta choose the Lamb had good portions and Appetizer and Dessert. Completed a movie and caught some sleep the mood lighting was good. The seat was a bit un-comfortable for a long flight (8.5 hrs) but due to the vacant seat next to me I could relax a bit. There was ample leg room. A light snack with coffee service was served 2 hours before landing. At AUH plane had to circle in the holding pattern for a while to the delayed arrival. Landing was smooth and taxi to gate +-10mins. The connecting was displayed on the IFE. Was taxied to T1 for connecting flight. Overall impression of the flight was good and pleaseant crew were hospitable courteous and attentive although would have expected beverage and cafe service top-ups after lunch. Toilets were clean and maintained by crew. Flight is recommend.

Ian Riddick",,14th January 2014,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,,3,no,2,Flew Manchester to Sydney 18/12/2013. Flight OK apart from 1 hour delay in Abu Dhabi sitting on runway. The return flight on 04/01/2014 was nothing short of a nightmare checked in at Sydney with Etihad partner Virgin Australia. Flight to Abu Dhabi was superb service etc very good. Our cases booked right through to Manchester but told to pick our connecting boarding card up in Abu Dhabi. On arrival the problem started we were told our flights did not show on their system and we were basically cut adrift by Etihad in the middle of the night. Told to pick up our cases from a deserted luggage hall at 3am then had to find the Etihad booking desk managed to book tickets for myself and my wife. The help and assistance we had from Etihad was zero.

A Al-Thani",,14th January 2014,,Business Class,,,4.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,,,4,yes,7,DOH-AUH-JNB return. Flight out to JNB was fantastic first leg on an Airbus A320 from Doha to Abu Dhabi a short flight that went smoothly. The were people to meet and assist at Abu Dhabi the connection was very smooth and the onward flight was on a newly refurbished A330 with the newest product in Business Class and the food was superb as was the IFE. Cabin staff were excellent and addressed us by our name I would like Etihad to give a much better amenity kit than the very poor one they give out right now. On the return it was nothing short of a disaster on all levels after arriving at JNB airport and getting our tax work done and checking in our luggage the lady at check in tells us that we will not be flying on Etihad but on Air Seychelles. I would have appreciated it if Etihad would have contacted me before I left my hotel and told me of the situation and given me a choice. The seats on the flight were uncomfortable and very hard though the leg room was good the sleeping position was terrible as it was not straight and the IFE was terrible the screen was very small and the selection was poor I refused to have a meal and just had a glass of Orange juice. I was contacted by Etihad after arrival and they offered me an apology which I accepted I will give Etihad another chance but they could have handled the situation so much better than they did.

Salmon Bin Sorogang",,13th January 2014,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,AUH-KUL-AUH by Jet Airways aircraft but operated by Etihad Airways. The plane is looking old and most of the seats were torn. IFE selection was good and the food was nice. From check in I would say the crew were very friendly. Overall experience was very good even from KUL take off on time and on time into AUH. The service during entire flight was fantastic with very helpful FA's. I definitely recommend Etihad.

M Horsfield",,13th January 2014,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,My wife and I flew in Business from LHR to BKK via AUH on EY18 and EY408 on 16th/17th October. Business Saver fare was an absolute bargain. We booked the limo service from Suffolk to LHR and this arrived on time and dropped us outside T4 for an additional charge of just £20 since our home was just outside the 100 mile trip limit. Quick check-in having pre-booked our seats and apart from the pretty useless Fastrack courtesy of Heathrow's disinterested staff we were in the lounge shortly thereafter. As lounges go it was fine - quiet comfortable and good service. Boarded 15 mins before departure with no delay and the gate was conveniently opposite the lounge. Jacket taken and champagne provided. Settled into comfortable seat in the Airbus 340 the excellent cabin staff explained the menu and took orders alongside after take-off drink requests. Flight took off on time and the rest of the inflight service was outstanding. The freshly made steak sandwich as a snack from the kitchen was as good a snack as I have had on any airline. Arrived into AUH on time but we had gated at the old terminal and had to transfer to the new one for our flight to Bangkok. Business lounge was very busy so we went in the First Class lounge and had a shower. Boarded EY408 on time and had a trouble free flight to BKK in a 777 this time but pretty similar set-up. Steak sandwiches just as good. Arrive BKK slightly ahead of schedule and given card to use its Premium lane so was cleared of immigration and collecting bags of carousel in quick time. Return leg was exactly the same with excellent service throughout and punctual arrival into LHR. My only gripe? The complimentary chauffeur. I initially booked one for arrival in BKK to our hotel but never got confirmation and when I tried to it seemed their was some confusion as to eligibility (2 journeys per adult passenger). Since it is hardly an expensive taxi from the airport to downtown Bangkok I cancelled it to make sure that we had the return from LHR to home but given the confusion wanted to make sure this was understood. I had to call Etihad in AUH in the end and it took ages and then started getting calls from the limo company in Bangkok advising what time they would be collecting us! When we arrived back at LHR they had organised a car for me and a car for my wife! We declined and continued our journey together. Seems like the system on these could be improved but it did not detract from the superb service.

Rajapavalm Narayanan",,13th January 2014,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,My wife and kids (5 yr old and 8 month) travelled from Chicago to Chennai on Dec 9th. As my wife and kids were travelling without me I selected Etihad because of the reputation it had and also the promise of an onboard nanny. 5 hours ahead of the flight departure I went to book a bassinet for my 8 month old just as was told that I cannot book a bassinet seat online and had to do in person. I had to wait 30 mins at the check in desk for the bassinet seat as they told me there was none available. Later they gave a bassinet seat for my wife/infant and 3 rows away a seat for my toddler. Finally all completed in 30 mins and we were let go with bassinet seat and seat beside for my toddler son. My wife and kids boarded without issues. However their cabin baggage was put elsewhere because the flight was full it was total chaos. The flight took off 3 hours late. As the flight left 3 hours late connecting flight from Abu Dhabi to Chennai would be missed if the connecting flight was not delayed. The stroller for the infant was sent to the connecting flight directly. My wife had to carry the infant and walk with the 4 yrs old 2 cabin bags and laptop bag. Why was there no service offered. I would not suggest this flight to family's travelling with toddlers and infants.

R Sandbaek",,10th January 2014,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,,,2,no,1,My family and I were flying Etihad from Abu Dhabi to Bangkok on 18th Dec 2013. The flight was 3 hours delayed and no service was given like a drink or food voucher and it was not operational problems. As an example we were about 250 passengers having boarded the flight and then a further delay of 1 hour as Etihad wanted to wait for 4 passengers. The captain in his first delay announcement did not even apologise for the delay and the crew did not feel responsible either and did not apologise. I and my family will never fly Etihad again.

P Ervin",,9th January 2014,,Business Class,,,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,2,no,3,BKK-AUH-CAI. Flight from BKK to AUH was on a Boeing 777 and excellent Pearl Business lay flat seats. Flight from AUH to CAI was a very old Airbus 319. Small plane cramped seating old and worn fabric. Recliners didn't really recline and the screen was in the armrest. Limited menu due to 4 hour flight time. Uncomfortable and ridiculous for the amount we paid.

If you can't load a plane or actually have someone meet the aircraft with the immigration cards in 7.5 hours there is something wrong. Will not fly again.

J Kpedekpo",,9th January 2014,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,,,2,no,3,Heathrow to Sydney via Abu Dhabi. Flight was packed with kids - obviously the sales pitch of the Norland trained nanny worked though I didn't see much evidence of them being around there was a lot of screaming/squealing all through the flight. Seat allocation is a nightmare be sure to get on-line as soon as you can and book your seats do not leave it until you get to the airport or you'll end up wedged in the middle of a middle section. I've flown a lot on many different airlines and I found the seats in this one incredibly tight and uncomfortable so much so that I woke up in the middle of the night once I got home because my back was so sore. The food was pretty ordinary in the middle of a 14hr leg to Sydney we got a cold bread roll with three thin slices of tomato on it. I have never been so hungry on a plane! The final service before landing was rushed with the staff basically tossing the food at us from piles in their arms there was only one choice and half the contents of my tray were missing but the staff were so stretched I didn't bother to harass them about it. The 30kg baggage allowance and the large toilets on board are good points but the rest of it was pretty average.

A Moore",,8th January 2014,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,3,no,1,Manchester to Kuala Lumpur via Abu Dhabi on New Year's Eve. On boarding dispute over 2 people sitting in wrong seats woman refused to move stewardess did not know how to handle it eventually after unsuccessfully pleading with her to move she told the couple whose seats they were that she would find them somewhere else to sit but they would be apart naturally they refused! Meanwhile nobody else could get past to get to their seats. Service on board was extremely slow we had the wrong menu card. Even though the Cabin Crew were wearing 'Happy new year' hats when we boarded there was only a passing reference to it being 2014 as we passed over Romania. Abu Dhabi airport experience was an awful chaotic shambles. Multiple flights arrived simultaneously and they clearly could not cope with the thousands of passengers in transit. Nobody knew what they were queuing for or even if they were in the right terminal. Airport staff were taking no notice of those who were trying to tell them they would miss their connection if they stayed in the queue luckily we had a 3 hour wait so we were not worried just bemused at the chaos. Security control was a joke only 6 manned and shouting to us to 'leave everything in your bags'. Not looking forward to going back through on the way home. Food on board was nothing special entertainment not brilliant headphones didn't work. Overall not a good experience would not use Etihad again travelled to KL with Emirates last time and there is no comparison. Must say however that landings were excellent hardly a bump.

Fernando Zanella",,8th January 2014,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,,,3,no,5,AUH to GRU: Cabin was hot and meal wasn't very good. I'm not demanding in terms of food but was not happy to see my wife and children barely eating. I thought the a/c had a problem I just had a t-shirt on and I was sweating. Second leg back to AUH: Again the cabin was too hot - very uncomfortable. It seems nonsense to keep temperatures high inside the airplane until someone complains. The flight attendants were very nice. Food again was a problem: we barely touched our first meal the last meal at the end of our flight my wife and children didn't even accept. Seat comfort entertainment are the usual similar to Emirates. Unfortunately I will not give Etihad another chance.

S Butt",,7th January 2014,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,,,1,no,2,Departed Brisbane 24 Nov 2013. We found this flight extremely disappointing. Being a family with small children the main priority for us was obviously to have as smooth a trip with the children as possible. We were recommended Etihad as they advertised to have a nanny onboard and are good with the children. We flew Brisbane to Singapore onward to Abu Dhabi onward to Paris onward to Toulouse in France. The children were not spoken to nor were we introduced to a nanny as per Etihads advertising until the Abu Dhabi to Paris flight. The nanny in this flight was very pleasant. However on the previous flight I had to ask for water twice before it was brought. We are returning to Australia with Etihad unfortunately. Hopefully the service is better. I would not recommend etihad to a family. I would recommend Etihad to an individual as the food was reasonable entertainment was good and the seats are as comfortable as any other airline.

A Joseph",,6th January 2014,,Business Class,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,no,4,Toronto to Trivandrum by business class. On the plane from Toronto to Abu Dhabi the cabin staff were more interested in selling duty free goods than serving passengers any food. I had to ask the flight steward to serve breakfast to my son who was awake for at least 45 minutes. The trip from Abu Dhabi to Trivandrum was good. The lounge was good but Terminal 1 was crowded and poorly organized. There was a long line up to check in and business class passengers were not given any priority. On our trip back the 13 hour flight from Abu Dhabi to Toronto was a disaster. They only served dinner and did not serve any food afterwards in business class! I had to ask for a cup of coffee which arrived minutes before landing in Toronto. I don't think I will be travelling Etihad again unless they change their service to passengers.

Michael Schade",,6th January 2014,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,,2,no,2,"EY 23 Abu Dhabi - Düsseldorf International. Only 4 check in counter open for Etihad flights at AUH airport terminal 3. Boarding chaotic with no sequence. Plane well maintained and clean. EY's biggest problem is their poor seat pitch and hard seats. This was one of the most uncomfortable flights I have had in a long time. Lots of kids on board parents had to wait for a long time to get their bassinets set up bottles warmed up etc. Then some time ago with big fanfare announced ""dedicated inflight nanny"" could not be seen anywhere. Staff were friendly but it was obvious that they were severely understaffed. IFE well below the standard of other middle eastern carrier."

Catherine Davies",,6th January 2014,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,I just returned from Abu Dhabi to Manchester on 1st of January with Etihad. I have to say the service and the crew was above of all my expectations. It was a very pleasant surprise after my experiences flying different airlines. Their care for passengers was obvious very attentive and smiling crew throughout the flight. The seats however made me suffer a bit but overall it was a nice experience. I would definitely choose them for my next flight.

L Duffy",,6th January 2014,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,Chengdu China to Manchester UK on 29th December. Now the service on the flight from Abu Dhabi was nothing to sing and dance about a busy flight with every seat booked out and cabin crew just scrambling about to keep everyone fed and watered. They did remember my special meal but it was an odd breakfast combination but this is the only reason food and beverages did not get five stars from me. Chengdu to Abu Dhabi: While the ground crew at Chengdu were clueless the cabin crew on this flight were excellent. Attentive and interested in the well being of passengers they conducted regular cabin walks and brought water every hour to passengers in economy. They even conducted a chocolate run going through the cabin during the night to see if anyone watching films or reading would like individual chocolates with another drink. On landing they were helping get baggage down and giving directions for first timers to Abu Dhabi about gates.

Brian Fisher",,3rd January 2014,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,All four legs were in business class taken during November 2013. The boarding process following a restful hour or so in the Airline's dedicated lounge at Heathrow was smooth efficient stress less and punctual. Aircraft (a Boeing 777-300) was as expected clean and in pristine condition. Although the seats in this cabin class were somewhat narrower than many other major carriers they were well appointed and functional as was the in-flight entertainment system. Food was of a high standard and served with a smile. My few requests (via the button) were answered promptly and I did not feel that they were in any way considered to be a nuisance. Arrival at Abu Dhabi and transfer to the next flight was seamless and I was soon on board. Cabin attendants were as professional as had been on the first leg as was the food. My in-built clock nudged me to operate buttons and turn my seat into a bed. It was time for some sleep. This was when the narrowness of the seat became more noticeable a pity really as a couple more inches would have given much more comfort. Following my tour”of Vietnamese culture and cuisine I returned to Bangkok - placed the top layer on and prepared for my return to London. This time after check-in I was directed to the airport's Apricot Lounge prior to boarding. Although quite a peaceful refuge its facilities fell far short of the Airline's own lounges. As expected the journey times against the prevailing jet streams were much longer but they were offset to some degree by the good service and ambience of the aircraft's business class cabin. Overall my experience of Etihad Airline certainly falls into the to the 'Very Good' category and if I had to give it marks out of ten it would score a solid nine.

Eddy Scott",,3rd January 2014,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,3,yes,6,This was my return flight back to Manchester my departure flight was poor bad service on the MAN-Abu Dhabi leg and Abu Dhabi-BKK was only slightly better yesterday's flights were totally different the service on both legs of the flight were exceptional good food drinks service very good could not fault any of the service side of the flight what I would say is that Etihad need to invest in new aircraft or refurbish the existing fleet as the seats and interior are getting very tired and uncomfortable. I will try another airline next year just to compare the airlines but if Etihad Want to retain their high status they need to listen to the customers that use their airline.

A Alhilou",,2nd January 2014,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,I booked to travel from MAN to AUH on EY22 on 20th Dec. I called EY's call centre to upgrade using miles/cash to business where I was assured that there are plenty of seats available and should head to the airport 3 hrs before departure to process this. The information given was completely incorrect as the desks opened 4 hrs before departure and all seats were taken by then which was very frustrating and disappointing. EY ground staff and EY's Business class lounge staff at MAN acknowledged the mishap and were very courteous and attentive and attempted to solve this problem. Return flight on EY21 on the 29th of December light load in J class we were well looked after by the excellent crew in J. as usual EY's catering is excellent cabin crew attentive and good hard product. I just wish they sort out the unhelpful call centre and bring back the old amenity kits in J class with Aigner products that were infinitely better than the current cheap substitutes.

No priority check-in for Business Class passengers told that we would be ferried to the plane on a separate bus once it arrived no such thing happened Business Class passengers last to board the plane.

George Smith",,29th December 2013,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,I flew 1st class Shanghai - Abu Dhabi - Heathrow. Lets start with the bad points we were collected from the Hilton by a driver wearing jeans in a car that needed a clean to be delivered to the airport. On arrival we were looked after promptly by Etihad ground staff and made our way to the 1st class lounge shared with Air China. This was not as good as many business class lounges and was happy to be moved on ASAP. Now the fun part on sitting down in seat 1A and drinking a glass of quality bubbly I had a very well cooked steak and drifted off for the night part of the journey. We arrived at Abu Dhabi and went through to the 1st class lounge quick shower bite to eat felt excellent. Went onto the next leg Abu Dhabi - Heathrow I must admit the level of service on this leg of the journey was the very best I have experienced. The team were a real credit to Etihad. I had a friend who was flying business class come up and join me for what was a fantastic meal all ushered through by the main steward without any hassle.

Riaz Osmani",,29th December 2013,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,no,6,LHR to Abu Dhabi and Dhaka Dec 25-26 in economy. Etihad's economy product is inferior to that of Emirates. Seats small and uncomfortable. IFE not as good. Food however is excellent. Three choice of entrees and the option I chose was very well prepared though a little stingy in portions. FAs pour alcoholic beverages from large bottles in tiny amounts. Wine selection was poor even for economy and their wine bottles were empty by the time they came to me. On the whole however the FAs on the first sector were gems. They provided service from the heart with genuine smiles. But they were horribly inefficient. It took them 4 hours from take off to finish dinner service and turn the lights down. And this was on a 6 hours night flight. An hour before landing they served breakfast wraps (much appreciated) which Emirates does not on similar flights to Dubai. Economy FAs on the flight to Dhaka were functional. Migrant workers from Bangladesh needed to be transported and fed and that is all the FAs achieved. No smiley engagements as in the first segment. Not impressed.

I was upgraded to Business Class for the 14 hour trip back from Melbourne to Abu Dhabi which was wonderful but even in Economy I was well looked after. The food was as good as it can be under the circumstances and the in flight entertainment was excellent. I didn't need the book I had brought with me at all. Staff were as attentive as they could be and I disembarked feeling I had had excellent value for money. I got to my destination safely. Some people expect way too much. If you want to be spoilt pay up and fly first class- and stop moaning.

Tony Williams",,16th December 2013,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,6,MAN-AUH-BKK in the last month. Chauffeur pick up and lounge at Manchester were excellent. Lounge in AUH was crowded. I noted that several passengers in the lounge were not travelling business class but were sprawled over the limited seating. Boarding at BKK was haphazard with no priority for premium passengers. This was my 5th trip this year with EY in Business class. I have noted some deterioration in standards but once on board this is compensated by the excellent service and meals.

Mark Craddock",,16th December 2013,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,,,3,no,1,Travelled from Jakarta to London Heathrow. Miserable experience with little to no customer service whatsoever. On both flights I wasn't even offered one drink aside tea or coffee during the dinner/breakfast service! I was also woken up three times whilst wearing a seatbelt to be told to put it on despite it being fastened clearly visible over the blanket! It seemed the only thing crew were interested in was the mandatory trolley service. Beyond that cabin service was non existent. My summary never again.

The lack of space was disgraceful for a long haul flight (or even a short one for that matter). My knees wouldn't fit had to put them either side of the seat in front and shoulders touched the people sitting next to me. Never again with Etihad.

Brian Evans",,12th December 2013,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,,3,no,8,Flew from Manchester to Sydney return via Abu Dhabi. Must say the flights were good. Abu Dhabi airport is a nightmare very busy and chaotic. Upgraded to business class for Abu Dhabi to Sydney and that was good. My problem relates to the customer services that they offer. It is very limited lip service that does not resolve any issues at all. I was charged double for the upgrade an Etihad mistake. I will not fly with them again.

P Barnwal",,12th December 2013,,Economy Class,,,5.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,,,2,no,1,JFK - Abu Dhabi - New Delhi on Dec 9. First leg was a bad experience. I inquired with the crew about the reason for such poor service delivery it turned out they only had 6 crew members to take care of 300 passengers. If you are flying at 9.40pm and don't see your dinner before 1.30am this can't justify any cost savings. I have been on shorter flights before and mostly they are able to provide full service even on flights of less than 2.5 hours. The crew were so small that even a small emergency can totally disrupt the service to whole plane. There was a health emergency and I must say the crew did pretty well. Other leg (of 3 hours) also had the same problem. I got my lunch in the last 40 mins of the flight that was after asking for it again. They had to stop beverage service minutes after they started it because the plane started descending.

Flight attendants were excellent. Wine and Champagne delicious. Lamb shanks were cooked to perfection. First Class flat bed is wide and long and allows for a great sleep / comfortable flight. AUH-DUB trip was business class. The business class flat bed is not long enough for people over 6"". I recommend a window seat for tall people - there is 'extra' space for your legs / feet between seat and side of plane."

My computer cables were all confiscated from my hand luggage by airport security. No signs and no warning from Etihad about this regulation. The Ethiad check in was chaotic with endless checks and then the flight was delayed We sat on the tarmac for an hour in the heat. It was 2.5 hours before I got water given and it was only because I asked for it. The food on board was so bad. There was no menu choice offered for the second of the meals hours later and people near refused it completely. Never again.

Four years ago when we flew with them for the first time they were excellent a true 5 star experience even in economy. Now 3 star at best. They seem to have been taking lessons on customer service from Ryanair but without the cheap fares to compensate they will just alienate their customer base. Emirates and Qatar are now much better and from Manchester offer alternative routings at similar cost. Flew out of Manchester and jobsworth checking hand baggage size and weight really degrading for what is sold as a luxury airline. Didn't have same experience at AUH on way home although check in a complete shambles there.

Checking in our bags at Dulles the ground staff were overly picky about the weight per bag not he total weight per passenger so I was there along with innumerable folks re-packing my suitcases. Then the hand baggage was weighed - not once but 3 times the last one being just before we got on the plane. This staff member came with a portable weighing scale and rechecked. When I got on the flight it was literally empty same thing with the return flight. I will never fly on this airline again.

B777-300 has larger PTV and has more storage flight seat pitch is bigger. Before take-off offered the option of pre-ordering drinks and meals. Dine anytime. As soon as at cruising height the drinks were dutifully served individually. Avoid row 11 as immediately in front of galley for economy class so very noisy. Served hot nuts choice of crab tian mezze parsnip and apple soup spiced land ouizi pan fried sturgeon tenderloins beef with red current jus. No complaints whatsoever although the amenity kits are now poor quality and basic no designer products.

James Choochot",,29th November 2013,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,MAN to AUH. Delayed landing due to fog so diverted to a regional airport after circling for a while. Plane needed refuelling and awaited weather improving. Once landed had to stay on plane but doors opened and soft drinks muffins and pastries supplied. Kept fully informed of situation by the pilot. PTV kept on and comedy sketch shows available. Delayed about an hour however whilst on board I received a text message from Etihad to inform me I would be transferred to another flight. On arrival at AUH boarding tickets awaiting us the next flight was held for us and our luggage even made the transfer. Completely efficient service. On board the meal selection in business consisted of anytime dining Aarabic mezze oven baked chicken! mushroom soup! chicken biryani! rack of lamb (exquisite) pan seared scallops tagliatelle cheeses desserts and ice cream. On board service excellent without being too intrusive.

M Khedekar",,27th November 2013,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,,2,no,3,Flew from Buffalo to Mumbai via Chicago and AUD. American Airlines from BUF to ORD. From previous experiences with BA and other better airlines I was carefree about connecting at ORD. Only to realize later that I had to go through another check-in at another terminal. Reaching the check-in counters there was a long queue. Apparently everyone was waiting to check-in. So even with the boarding passes I had of AA they meant nothing. Nowhere did anyone tell me about rechecking in. I waited patiently. Elderly passengers who were also connecting from different cities in the US were annoyed. A rude man walked up and asked everyone with AA boarding passes to queue up separately. I was to fit my industry standard carry-on bag in a non-industry standard bag frame. I was told that I will have to check my bag. Having already paid in Buffalo for excess luggage it seemed like a way of making money out of people's miseries. So apparently the check-in was another money collecting routine by the airline. Went through security again. By the time I reached the gate it was chaotic: noise and chaos galore. Onboard the seats were hard space was tight. FAs were nice and pleasant. Inflight entertainment was ok. Food service and drinks service was very good. Liked the fact that they had steel cutlery. Connecting at AUD was painful. Long walk. The walkways were not helpful. AUD to BOM flight was in a Jet Airways plane. The interiors were old. Run down. General drunk passenger. FA handled him courteously. Food was good again. Inflight Service was very good throughout. Will fly Etihad maybe Business/First because if you're Economy no one cares.

The only problem I had on my journey is from the inlight staff. I was traveling with a six month old baby. In order to get a small cup of water I had to ask three times. The flight staff were not willing to offer any help when required and whenever I called for some help they never showed up. I hope this will be my last trip with this airline.

I was asked to remove the 0.05 kg! I was travelling with my wife and two kids but were only carrying 2 carry on and two laptop bags and 3 check-in bags. so we rearranged things and were able to get it all through without throwing anything away. Then towards the end of the flight I went back to the kitchen area to get water the flight attendant couldn't find a cup and she just picked up a couple one of the two cups already had a little water in it. The flight between Washington DC and Abu-Dhabi is long. 13 hours going east and 15 hours going west. After a few hours the restrooms smell with water everywhere. Abu-Dhabi airport is horrible no trams/trains connecting the terminals. After 13 to 15 hours on the flight walking and standing in security lines - horrible experience.

Very satisfied with the service. Complimentary chauffeur service was also very good which is something you don't normally get as a business class flier in the other airlines. Overall I am very satisfied with EY the only downside is their horrible terrible Customer Service responses. When something goes wrong (such as claiming missing miles) you will test your endurance and tolerance level to the limit. Often you encounter extremely slow or no responses even if you get responses you will likely see the customer care staffs making so many mistakes so you will have to start the claim process all over again. I can guarantee the worst quality customer care center really kills the EY's reputation.

Carmel Monaghan",,19th November 2013,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,,3,yes,6,I flew return from Sydney to Abu Dhabi with in a trip to Norway and back. I found this airline to be fairly good. The food quality was good though maybe more water rounds would have been helpful. Seats were relatively comfortable though being when the person in front put their seat back it seemed to be a big recline. I was in the seat with the wall behind me and not able to put mine back as far to compensate. Leg room was much better than Air Berlin who I have traveled the other part of the trip. Staff were friendly and assisted as needed to all especially those with small children. My only complaint was with the toilets. The sink was blocked straight after take off one ran out of toilet paper and by the end of the 16 hour flight were revolting. Cleaning needed to be done during the flight and was not.

C Hunt",,19th November 2013,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,,,2,no,3,Flew economy London - Abu Dhabi - Male return previously always flow Emirates however this fare was £500 cheaper in the sale so thought we would try them. The two flights on the larger planes in and out of London were awful no leg room and as other people say when you recline your seat the base goes forward leaving you with no leg room. Even my 9 year old was not comfy the seats are hard and narrow. The flights from Abu Dhabi to Male were better more room bigger seats however toilets are at back next to galley so a nightmare squashing in and out. Food on all sectors was disappointing given a brown paper bag with a sandwich. Had run out of our choice on one leg. Found staff in general to be very abrupt. Also one drinks service coming into London. I also don't like that when I asked for a gin and tonic they mix it themselves instead of giving you the mini bottles so you have no idea how much they have put in. Thought the entertainment was okay but nothing amazing. Apart from the minimal leg room the worst part was being stuck for 3 hrs in Abu Dhabi airport. It is small with very limited eating areas Abu Dhabi to male we didn't even have seating at the gate everyone was on the floor then straight on. Queues for transit both ways were horrendous and badly organised we were in the end taken through the business express lane. If you are used to Dubai airport I don't recommend it. I wish we had spent the £500 more and flown Emirates. Will never fly again with Etihad.

My parents and I travelled from Dublin to Abu Dhabi and then to Sydney on Oct 25th and return on Nov 15th. I am just 5ft 3 and I found seat space minimal. Food was disgusting on both journeys. We found the staff rude and unhelpful. They ran out of food and by time they got to us there was no choice left. One of the air hostess actually said to me 'I have nothing left for you. I guess I can check 1st class but don't hold your breath'. I was polite to all staff but was ignored on more than one occasion. As for Abu Dhabi the airport is easy to get around but again the staff are lacking in basic customer service. Will never travel to Abu Dhabi again nor will I fly with Etihad again.

Negatives: They have the least amount of leg-room I've experienced on any airline. The articulating seat pan makes the problem unbearable - when you recline the seat back your seat cushion moves forward thrusting your knee into the seat in front of you. The worst part is that I had to endure with this on a 14+ hour transatlantic flight. Understaffed - slow service. They only allow 7kg/~15lbs for carryon baggage. This equates to a near empty rollaboard or a small backpack. Positives: You can redeem American Airlines miles on their airline. I got safely to my destination.

Plane interior looked dated seat was very uncomfortable and leg room was extremely tight. I would have thought this pitch suitable for a short haul route but not long haul. Entertainment was so-so better than some but not up to their competitors standard. Snack after take off was adequate given the time of departure (chicken wrap or pumpkin and fetta) I was just given one and had no idea which it was until biting into it but took a very long time for anything to be served or offered. Breakfast was quite decent although served extremely early before arrival. Service took a long time to complete due to only one crew operating my side of the cabin. There seemed to be a distinct lack of crew throughout the economy cabin. Nothing else was offered between services. Blanket and pillow were good as was amenity pack. What lacks was the seat comfort. Crew were polite and seemed to work hard to compensate for the lack of comfort.

Awful flights would avoid booking with otherwise great Virgin again if we're forced to use Etihad Airways their ""code share partner"". Very cramped and uncomfortable seats with a lack of legroom for tall people like me. Had a full flight very stuffy and noisy mix of rude passengers. Cabin crew tried but seemed tired and understaffed. Food was good Entertainment system was okay but a more limited selection than Air NZ and other airlines flown between Australia and Europe before. Stopover in Abu Dhabi was terrible on way to London huge lines and delays in overcrowded stuffy terminals to go through passport checks (twice) ground crew were rude. Inflight ads kept going on about how the airline had been named best airline for the umpteenth year running ? Cannot understand why will do best to avoid at all costs in the future."

The price of their business class tickets are now the same as airlines that fly direct. It was worth flying them when they offered a cheaper fare but not worth it now for the following reasons. Lounges both in Abu Dhabi and London a disgrace crowded with useless staff. A new policy that you only get 2 limo transfers per trip I am gold but the person traveling me was not. Bangkok refused to confirm if my travel companion could travel with me on the London transfer. It took 4 phone calls in London to get it sorted. Menu choice is now boring. Entertainment system is full of old movies. The seats on the BKK to AUH sector are old. This airline keeps stating its the best - does its management fly other carriers. The management should also try calling its offices in Bangkok and London and have to wait forever to be answered.

At the airport my passport is checked at check in - no problems. Passport control the passport is checked twice. I arrived at the gate 55 mins before flight departure to find a long queue. Before getting to the gate another passport and boarding card check for the name. Then the gate. We waited and waited and waited. Security also waited and waited. There are only two persons manning the gate for a full A340-600 flight to Sydney. I observed both counters. The First and Business counter was taking around 45 seconds to process a passenger. The economy counter was around 1 min 10 sec per pax. Finally I get to the gate counter 5 minutes before the scheduled departure. Again 1 minutes to process my boarding pass and no reason when I asked why they needed my passport. Tthere were 53 people behind me so I knew the departure would be late. Of course it was by 52 minutes. The flight was as good as it could be for an overnight flight with friendly staff and plenty of food.

Ian Mcintosh",,5th November 2013,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,,5,yes,6,October 18 Seat 23H Flight EY461. Melbourne to Abu Dhabi. I suppose it is inevitable that comparisons will be made between this flight and the Emirates 777 economy service to Dubai. Having done both now I would say they are fairly level pegging apart from the fact that Etihad uses an A340 600 with a 2x4x2 configuration much preferable to Emirates 3x4x3 for couples. The A340 is very quiet and surprisingly comfortable even on a 14 hour leg. Clients wanting to stopover will prefer Dubai. While boarding was orderly and relaxed the experience was spoiled a little at check-in. I had booked through Virgin Australia using points and pay - and assumed travel on a major partner airline would be seamless. No such luck. First the check-in guy had to call Virgin - then the airport duty manager got involved and eventually phoned Abu Dhabi for approval. Meanwhile we went for a long walk - it was that or be stabbed in the back by the anxious horde waiting to be checked in. Finally all was fixed - but it took about 40 minutes. The welcoming crew were bright and chatty and flight EY461 left Melbourne on time. Note that the bins above the window seats are smaller than the centre aisle. Safety instructions are via animated video and crew demos. The entertainment screens are a good size and the touch system really easy and simple to use. Emirates ICE is also great but the touch controls don't always work all that well. About a half hour out hot paper towels were served and dinner started 40 minutes later. I had Moroccan beef casserole in couscous not the most appealing looking dish but quite tasty thanks mostly to the black olives. I was pleased to see Australian products were used. The meals are medium in size the other noteworthy point is that steel utensils are used. I had a glass of red wine and asked for another when the trays were taken but the bottle had gone. To her credit the hostess did fill my glass later. Breakfast was scrambled eggs with the lot - fine for me. To summarise: Apart from the hiccup at check-in smooth good value flying.

After seeing the pictures online and flying on what seemed like a lawn dart with AA I was so excited to fly on the Etihad Airways. However that quickly ended as soon as we landed in Chicago and had to get in another line to check in. A man met you before you even went through the line and placed your bag in the carry on stand to check if it fit. After seeing him give one lady a hard time with hers since the handle grazed the side I knew we were done. Sure enough all 4 carry ons we got on fine with AA were ""overweight"" and exceeded everything else they could possibly find wrong. So $700 later we had to pay for all 4. Absolutely no care about it and the guy needed a manager to override it. She even shook her head at the ridiculous fees but still did nothing. Although they present this put together and professional staff the unfriendly crew poor meals and lack of overhead complements as we saw a few quarrels over space it was anything but. I'd much prefer my laid back friendly JetBlue or Southwest staff any day. Needless to say we plan to travel extensively while living abroad in AD but will not use Etihad again."

Unfortunately this couldn't be arranged for their connecting flight in Abu Dhabi. A little confused we asked how they could all be gone 14 hours before that flight. We were told they had been reserved. I understand that airlines have different bassinet policies and accept that. Over the next 2 hours we were told it was our fault for not buying another seat that they wouldn't have a look to see how full the 2nd flight was and they wouldn't speak to our travel agent who was trying to help us. Finally with my children distressed and my wife in tears she simply said she couldn't fly so we went home.

The having to queue in Abu Dhabi for the boarding pass to Manchester was disgusting at a time when you would like to be relaxing after a 14 hour flight and looking around the airport instead you have to queue for a minimum of between 1 and 2 hours to get a boarding pass. The same on the way home had to do it all over again. The flights were very good cant complain about them but this can really turn you off flying with them again. I know they are two different airlines but flying together in unison surely this problem could be sorted out to the passengers convenience.

C Adam",,28th October 2013,,Business Class,,,2.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,,,3,yes,7,London to Bangkok staff very helpful found the seating very narrow and little space inside the seating and eating resting area. The film selection frankly was poor far too many children's films and poor content. The airline should review who is making the selection and look at other airlines (recommend Singapore). Food and wine good. Outgoing both aircraft had up to date equipment. The return journey Bangkok to Hub was an older type aircraft and equipment requires modernisation.

Rose Leslie",,25th October 2013,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,3,yes,4,Oct 21 from New Delhi through Abu Dhabi to Washington Dulles on EY 131. It wasn't bad. There were two drawbacks. One was the long line in Abu Dhabi when transiting to India. The other is the strange rule about only one carry on. They sometimes enforce and sometimes don't but its also supposed to be under 7 kg which is unrealistic at the least. I had to put up a fight to get on the flight home with my camera and small carry on which weighed 10 kg.

Luz Nuno",,23rd October 2013,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Lisbon-Milan-Abu Dhabi-Sydney on 3 4 and 5th October first flight codeshare with TAP second flight crowded but nice flight very nice cabin crew tried to make flight more pleasant. Third leg Virgin Australia also in codeshare crowded also but very nice. Sydney-Abu Dhabi-Dublin-Lisbon 18-19 October also a very crowded first leg plenty of food and drinks ice creams. Second leg during the night half full flight could move seats to sleep the crew organized for all passengers to have plenty of space to sleep. Last leg codeshare with Air Lingus horrible and late. Overall a very good service will fly Etihad again.

Kate McDonell",,23rd October 2013,,First Class,,,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,,3,no,3,We travelled first class Sydney to Paris via Abu Dhabi and return in September/October. We had 2 previous experiences with Etihad on this same flight both in Business Class. The first time in 2009 was excellent. Service meals attention to detail was second to none. The second trip was a little less so less attentive the calibre of meals had deteriorated somewhat and service was definitely in decline. So this time we thought we would go First Class. Such a disappointment. From the check in at Sydney Airport - where apart from not being in a queue we could have been anyone for the level of attention and reception received. Thank heavens for the Express Passes to get us quickly through customs and immigration. The cabins in First were excellent the flat beds long and as comfortable as you could get and the beds were made up with sheets. Cabin crew were efficient but certainly lacked the warmth of previous flights. The chefs advised that they could prepare anything for us where in fact the meals were very ordinary and unimaginative. It also took a long time to be served. I know they were striving for a 'dining experience' but when you are tired and hungry you don't want to wait nearly 4 hours as we did on our flight home. I also don't want to hear how tired the staff are how busy they are or any other excuses as we did on several flights. I think we have given Etihad every chance to prove themselves but we may not fly with them again.

Found staff uncaring: food disappointing: seats uncomfortable: everything very grubby. Return flight had to wait almost 3 hours at transfer desk before they would issue my boarding pass. When I asked for a drink at midnight on return flight one attendant asked the other 'do we have anything open'? I only wanted water or perhaps orange juice!

A Llewellyn-Evans",,22nd October 2013,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,Sydney to Abu Dhabi and then to Athens and back from Istanbul to Sydney in September and October this year. We were lucky enough to gain upgrades for the two longer legs and this made the flight more enjoyable. As all the previous writer indicate there certainly is a step up with Business class and while I could not justify paying the full price the chance to upgrade sections is worthwhile. The space is the major gain you have what seems the equivalent of 3 seats you can stretch out have places which to store books glasses and water bottles and certainly the amenity kit is worthwhile. The service also improves with a higher staff ratio and they were certainly attentive to all needs from extra blankets to late night snacks (I can recommend the steak sandwich). The food which while not that much better than economy is presented in a more sophisticated way and taken with the space makes dinning an enjoyable experience. Would I recommend the upgrade yes for the longer legs 12-14 hours for the shorter ones 4-6 hours you can survive!

Didn't find out until I checked in that I had been successful. It was definitely worth every penny. Super-fast boarding very comfortable lie-flat seat/bed excellent choice of food and drinks from a very extensive menu with great presentation and very professional service. There were 4 cabin crew for approximately 15 passengers. The only negative: had to change seats as the TV remote control wasn't working. The aircraft was an older 777. Very good experience.

C Hellings",,13th October 2013,,First Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,Purchased a return trip flying first class from Melbourne to London in Sept/Oct 2013. Flight to London was excellent - could not fault. However when arriving at airport for return flight - return ticket no longer worked? Etihad claimed it was American Airlines fault and they needed to sort it and therefore they did nothing to assist me. AA are their sister airlines but are at another terminal at Heathrow - Etihad would not assistance in sorting out problem - obviously could not be bothered. Now flying with Singapore but have to wait another 10 hours. Thank you for your lack of assistance Etihad - other airlines are far more helpful.

P Morris",,9th October 2013,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,EY22 Manchester to Abu Dhabi EY622 Abu Dhabi to Mahe EY621 Mahe to Abu Dhabi EY15 Abu Dhabi to Manchester. We decided to try Etihad rather than fly with Emirates. What a mistake. There is no leg room if you are tall. When the person in front put their seats back it was most uncomfortable and the staff only begrudgingly asked them to put them upright when the meal was being served. The food was not very good. There was no clean up of the toilets during a 7.5 hour flight. There was no way you could walk around as if you went to the rear of the plane the staff frowned if you went into their space. The films on offer were not very good. The Etihad flight from the Seychelles was an hour late and we came into gate 35 then had to rush to transit at gate 1 and then rush to gate 36 for our Manchester flight. All in all it was an experience that we will not be repeating.

Al-Bayyari Moath",,9th October 2013,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,Abu Dhabi (AUH) to London Heathrow (LHR). Etihad requires the passenger to check in at the airport at least 1.5 hrs before the flight. As you approach the airport the streets are filled with signs to guide you on where to go. When you reach workers with trolleys will be waiting for you to help with the luggage. While you're entering the terminal the security check is after the luggage check therefore it will be comfortable for the passenger to go through security without having to worry about the luggage. After the security check and when you are ready to board you will walk through a fairly small duty free which requires improvement. The shops were not organized and small and the food court is very small and does not have the variety that would make the passengers have a good experience at the airport. I boarded the Boeing 777 which was very large compared to the other airplanes I went on. There are two lines before you enter a line for economy class and the other for business and first class. The line for economy was much longer than the other line. I did not have to wait because my ticket was a business class ticket. The flight welcomed the passengers with smiles which was a great start. The passenger is guided to his seat and helped with placing his hand luggage. The seats were small as my expectations were higher for a highly priced ticket that cost 8130 AED. However as the plane took off and the passengers were allowed to move the seats it turned out to be very comfortable as the seats can turn into a bed. The service was very quick and I had access to food at all times during the flight. Overall it was a great flight that I recommend for all.

Bourne Denzil",,3rd October 2013,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,I flew on EY20 (LHR AUH) on 23 Sept. B777 in economy. The flight was empty so we were all able to spread ourselves out. The cabin service was quick and friendly. Drinks flowed and the food was actually really good for economy. IFE seemed limited but acceptable for a short flight. One crew member seemed to be new and a little lost but I'm sure she will be on top of her game after a couple flights. Leg room was fine but seat width across the shoulders may have been uncomfortable if the flight had been full. I will fly again.

Bourne Denzil",,3rd October 2013,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,Flew EY878 (AUH-NRT) on 24 Sept. A332. Had to bus from the terminal to the jet. Managed to get a paid upgrade to Business. Seat seemed to be narrow But was great when flat. Service was outstanding from boarding to disembarkation. IFE in Business was the same as in Economy. I expected more from the amenity kit. I would pay for an upgrade again.

S Prasad",,1st October 2013,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,2,no,5,Travelled SYD-AUH-LHR and back. Firstly the pros the service and entertainment were great. Food and drinks (water) kept coming. Washroom was clean all the way that's pretty good for 21-22 hours. But the reason I may not travel again on Etihad on a long haul flight are the seats very uncomfortable I am not very tall so leg room was adequate but the seats were very hard and not at all good for my back. The armrest on all flights did not have the cushion part sewn on it it was just hard. For long haul flight all passengers whether first class or economy require a certain degree of comfort which was sorely lacking on Etihad. I am not anti-Etihad perhaps for a trip to NZ I would travel on it again but never again for a trip to Europe.

Mel Thirnton",,1st October 2013,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,,,2,no,3,Flew from Manchester on 21 September to Abu Dhabi with Etihad had very mixed expectations as I had flown last year with Emirates who were very poor. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised as the flight and the staff were outstanding - nothing was too much trouble. Having said how good our flight was we now had high expectations of our connecting flight to Colombo - how very disappointed we were. Badly organized didn't check seat belts left our meal tray for 45 mins after everyone was finished - not sure what they were doing. We only had to wait 20 mins for them to answer our calls and then 10 more mins to bring the wine.

Sets are too small for majority of those around 6 ft. I saw at least 7 passengers with their knees jammed in seats and one tall woman in tears. Meals were ordinary and drinks adequate - most staff do their best once on board and the cabin manager was great. Most disturbing thing is the stop and re-board at AUH. Main terminal is a disorganised mess - toilets are inadequate. Bussed to plane air conditioning useless and by the time you get to aircraft you are seething.

S Goussetis",,29th September 2013,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,Flew from AUH to MAN. No check in at Abu Dhabi as was transit passenger from another airline. Was bussed from remote stand for a long ride unimpressed with the airport itself and long security lines. Seat assignment pre- booked honoured. Full flight to Manchester AVOD was decent but could be better. Found cabin crew polite professional though the male staff seemed professional. Food was good with full hot breakfast before arrival. All in all a good flight which pleasantly surprised me.

Janarthanan Geetha",,25th September 2013,,Business Class,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,Flew from D.C to Chennai. Things were not good at Abu Dhabi the terminal and Gate to India was over crowded and no place to even stand. The arrival time to Chennai was 1.5 hrs delayed and we lost our connecting domestic flight. On the way back the seats were not assigned properly they canceled our selected seats. In a four seat row for a family of four we were given three seats and we had to travel with a toddler for a 15 hr flight from Abu Dhabi to D.C. The seats are not that great either they are narrow and not much leg space. Only good thing is the flight crew.

Excellent selection and very comfy. The boarding was a little chaotic but once onboard excellent flight. Wine selection was wonderful as was the food selection. Transfer very easy. Next leg was in First. I was the only person in First and what an experience. Food was of restaurant quality having my own chef literally. The wine and champagne again was of tip top standard. As nobody else was on board I had my own dining booth and my own sleeping booth. Managed a full 7 hours uninterrupted sleep. Breakfast again was superb.

Even if I couldn't sleep on the two flights the crew were offering drinks and food during the night time. Food was good as usual as well as the entertainment system. I love flying with this airline and can recommend it to everyone. Compared to others the seat comfort is good and I had plenty of leg space.

T Bawden",,24th September 2013,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,,,2,no,2,After booking my tickets I advised customer services of my disabled needs. When I arrived at the airport this information was not on my booking and so I had to explain again my disabilities and needs at the check in desk. On arrival into AUH the plane was parked on a remote stand. after the plane has disembarked I had to wait a further 20 mins for ground crew to bring the lift to get me off! I was taken straight to the connecting gate as normal. At the gate I had to identify myself to the staff who had no history of my needs and I had to stop a ground staff and request my own assistance to board the flight via the lift. I boarded nearly last which meant jostling . Again no specific instructions in case of an emergency were given - it is usual to be informed what the crew will do for me to get me off in an emergency. I have before have I been treated with less dignity or support.

Very slow check in at Abu Dhabi airport flight delayed for 5.5 hours without prior notification and also without a word of apology. Return flight on time.

My two flights can only be described as the worst flying experiences I have had to date. Aircraft was an old A330 with a ""brown"" interior and the tightest long haul seating configuration I can recall. Service on board varied from dated to simply rude and unhelpful. Special meals booked in advance did not arrive and no alternates offered. However all of this was minor in comparison to the purser on the return leg who was rude to the point of being intimidating. Inflight entertainment system was old but would have been better if it had actually functioned. Recommend you eat well before the flight and take a book for entertainment if you have to travel with this airline."

A Sargeant",,18th September 2013,,Business Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,8,Moscow - Abu Dhabi - Bangkok. A good trip although check in staff member seemed not to speak English. Flight was a little late leaving Moscow and arriving in Abu Dhabi which made the transit a little stressful as it was not clear that I and my luggage would make the second flight. Cabin staff were friendly and attentive but no one spoke Russian on the Moscow - Abu Dhabi sector. Food and wine were good but the service a little slow especially on the Abu Dhabi sector where I was trying to get a reasonable amount of sleep. Both planes were good and clean and with seats being fully flat beds were restful and spacious. The IFE was good on both planes and we were permitted to use the IFE until we had landed. The airport in Abu Dhabi was undergoing extension/renovation and a bus was used to transport passengers to the terminal. The lateness in arrival meant that the plane was about to board so it was not possible to eat in the lounge and then only sleep on the second flight. Here supper rather than dinner was late being served so valuable sleep time was lost. Bag did make the second flight but it was one of the last off the plane in Bangkok so received zero priority!

Lahore - Abu Dhabi was fine Abu Dhabi - Washington was good though seats were small there was no room to stretch legs on such a long flight of 15 hours. Flight was on time.

They weren't listening to bells and were taking too much long to bring even water. Overall it was a good experience.

The food was excellent the seat / bed was extremely comfy the staff and service could not have been faulted. I am flying again to Sydney at the end of October and am looking forward to the trip as the flight can be part of your holiday rather than just the drag at the beginning and end.

It was the worst flight we have ever encountered! Our seats were very uncomfortable very little leg room! We had to request a safety belt for my daughter just before takeoff as we were taxing down the runway! No cabin staff checked if I was familiar with the procedure of applying this belt or indeed if I had applied it correctly . Only infant food available no alternative offered despite requesting alternative toddler food. My Toddler had no food except what I brought onboard. Cabin staff were rude and definitely not child friendly! Hot food was just put down despite having a toddler on my knees! Inflight entertainment was very poor. My flight from Abu Dhabi to Dublin improved in terms of more efficient customer focused cabin staff but otherwise very disappointing overall experience.

I was on crutches and informed the airline that my surgeon had requested that I needed to keep my foot elevated during the flight. The airline assured me that there would be no problems and that I would be able to sit in the baby section which had more leg room. When we arrived at the airport and checked in I found out that I did not have the extra leg room. I got on the plane and spent the next 14 hours with my leg up on the food table which was extremely uncomfortable. While on the plane the hostess also had to take away my crutches so they were out of the way of other passengers. At other times within the flight I pressed my buzzer to call the flight attendant over and I was completely ignored. This was the worst experience I have encountered.

M H Bergman",,29th August 2013,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,,1,no,1,As a regular Etihad flyer (UK - Australia return every 3/4 months) I have to say the service quality is slipping below an acceptable standard. All their efforts are spent on their first or business clients so if you are going economy you can only expect the bare minimum of customer care and comfort. The entertainment system is very good but lost baggage seat comfort pre-assigning seats and being able to easily contact a helpful customer service when things do not go to plan are also part of the service I consider myself to be paying for and Etihad do not deliver on these points. Also they code share with airlines that are well below Etihad's standard its very disappointing to believe you are paying extra for a good airline only to find you've been code shared onto a second rate partner airline.

Both Etihad flights were excellent comparable service to Qatar and Emirates really. FA's extremely courteous and attentive for both legs excellent IFE and seemingly very well executed landings. Only gripe is the rather inefficient process of attaining boarding passes due to the code share with Air Berlin. At first Air Berlin staff informed me something was strange about my booking and they could only check me in as far as Dusseldorf after making me wait 15 minutes they then told me they could check me in as far as Abu Dhabi. Upon arrival in Abu Dhabi had to line up again to get my boarding pass for onward flight to Hyderabad. Surely it should be possible to check passengers and their luggage through to the final destination from the point of first departure. I didn't understand the logic in that. Overall only added an extra 30-45 minutes of effort to overall flight experience though so not that bad. Would definitely recommend Etihad to anyone considering it.

Vegetarian food was requested at the time of booking. Instead leftovers were offered. Throughout the flights they had no record of me requesting a vegetarian menu. Cabin staff service was very slow. On one instance while food and drinks were being served it seems I was ignored and finally when I requested coffee it took a very long time to arrive and this also after a reminder.

Henry Fabrice",,15th August 2013,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,,5,yes,8,Switzerland to Singapore. Compared with Singapore Airlines it is cheaper for almost same seat and space comfort in the cabin. The service is great maybe less cabin crew but still great as they do their best for you. They are strict with safety food is good but compared to other airlines is more simple bread not so good. The down side for me was entertainment disappointed. On way back got opportunity for cheap business upgrade. Great business class. Good value for money. Great food very good service with nice crew. Seat perfect and flat. Downside again entertainment. The other downside is Abu Dhabi airport one of the most boring international hub airports I've transited. Not much too do lack of good seats. Very few opportunities to sleep. Small airport hotel always fully booked.

Daniel Kisliakov",,13th August 2013,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,3,no,6,Melbourne to London. All in all decent experience. Crew were excellent on both legs especially considering that the Abu Dhabi leg was completely full. Good entertainment system and food not bad. The major drawback is the seat pitch. Seats themselves fine but when they're crammed it affects the whole experience. Might make me consider another carrier in the future for that reason.

G Mavrides",,13th August 2013,,Business Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,The seats in Pearl Business Class are unusually narrow and short as others have written. I weigh 173lbs (78kg) and am 170cm tall. The foot enclave is so narrow that I could not comfortably place both feet together. I had to sleep with one knee bent the entire time. There is simply no way an overweight or tall passenger would be able to squeeze into this seat. The IFE system is very poor in variety and choice and Etihad Airways forces their passengers to watch a 90-120 second commercial (that cannot be skipped) before every program. This is very irritating. On both fights the electrical outlet did not work and I lost battery power on my iPad before the end of each flight. Every seat on the return flight in Business Class was full and the air temperature in the cabin was at least 75 degrees (24 Celsius). My wife and I were perspiring during the entire 9 hour flight and were unable to sleep due to the hot cabin. The food was surprisingly bad. I ordered the “grass-fed fillet of beef” and my wife chose the mushroom lasagne. I returned the beef after the first bite. The mushroom lasagne was mediocre and my wife couldn't finish it. For the entire 9 hour trip we subsisted on mixed nuts and Diet Pepsi. The quality and variety of the food are considerably better on many other lower cost business class flights.

Aran Lally",,12th August 2013,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,A great flight experience that can get you from to Dublin to Abu Dhabi in 7 hours 20 minutes. A great deal and the seats were pretty comfortable. Staff were sometimes annoying but good overall. However like many airlines I don't like the food but the beverages were good. I would rather starve yet hydrate. The best part was the entertainment. There were lots of movies and games and the headphones were quite comfortable. The plane I was in had new AC power ports that would activate about 2 to 3 hours into the flight and switch off just before landing. All in all it was a great experience.

We were well placed close to the window great seat comfort plane quite new great stewards service. My headphone wasn't working and the hostess gave me a new one within 5 mins with apologies. Good food and good vegetarian food. Good choice of entertainment. Flight was quiet. Cabin was not cold at all and we were glad for such good comfort.

M Goodman",,6th August 2013,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,,3,no,3,Complaint about Air Berlin (Etihad's partner) Phuket-Manchester. Etihad in my opinion is very close to being a premium airline but are being seriously let down by Air Berlin who are absolutely a Budget Airline in every sense. Today (6th August) we sat in the plane on the tarmac for 2 hours at Abu Dhabi. It appeared that Air Berlin had over booked the plane. Some passengers had the same seat ticket and had to be let off. The food on Air Berlin is a joke. I had pre-ordered a vegetarian meal however there were none and the stewardess said the main meal (omelette and sausage) - I could eat that and just eat around the sausage. She then said the vegetarian option was really only for children and I could have that. It was a 'crepe' with a slice of peach. Hours old and disgusting. The food on the Etihad flight was excellent. The drinks on the Air Berlin leg were all lo-cost type drinks. The entertainment system on Air Berlin is rubbish. I absolutely will not fly with Air Berlin again and I will be complaining directly to Etihad that they are being seriously let down by their partner in this leg. I do not expect to pay a premium price for a budget airline which makes up half the leg (The Phuket to Abu Dhabi leg).

Pity that Abu Dhabi lounge was lacking as was the staff in general. Certainly too small for flight numbers and waiting for one person to serve drinks was laughable. Would certainly never ever take a flight out of Paris again but assume that was either the handling agents or AF on the first leg/last return leg. Not enough planes as the delay on the way back due to another incoming that made another 300 people late was silly.

While Manchester Airport staff handled things very well and Flight Attendants were very good on Manchester to Abu Dhabi segment things deteriorate once you reach Abu Dhabi Airport to catch flight to India. Extremely crowded. When boarding started for my flight to Delhi there was a staff member to selectively snatch Carry-on Luggage. They say that space is limited and you will get it at Delhi Airport. When I boarded I saw people with even bigger carry-on luggage then mine. At Delhi told my bag would be with on Luggage Belt. On return from Delhi again staff were taking carry on bags. I saw many people returning their Special Meal when it comes to our choice choices were very limited and many has run out. Between Delhi-Abu Dhabi I found staff a bit rude. Full marks to Manchester Airport to Abu Dhabi flight crew and also the staff managing Abu Dhabi Airport to Manchester flight. Unless they sort out this fiasco about carry-on bags between Delhi to Abu Dhabi I will avoid travelling with Etihad. Food is good and they give complimentary drinks.

S Nkavoyannis",,4th August 2013,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,For some reason First Class is not always available on the Abu Dhabi to Athens leg and so after travelling FC from MEL I had to use the Business Class Lounge. Fine - except for the fact that there was not enough room for everyone to sit down. After a long trip this is not amusing. Perhaps this lounge should be enlarged as everything else about the lounge is more than adequate. Why is it that there is no sign (a green light something!) to indicate that the toilets are empty? This would appear to be a fairly standard design detail. Very inconvenient. I have travelled on FC and BC on Etihad and am satisfied. However the real test of an airline is how it treats its Economy Class passengers. I will be checking out these comments.

Colin Walsh",,1st August 2013,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,,,3,no,2,Very disappointing flight (DUB-AUH-SYD) recently. Etihad have been steadily getting poorer and this is it for us. No seat assignment on booking to the AUH-SYD (14 hour) leg. Phoned Etihad office in Dublin on several occasions who agreed to file seat request on our behalf. Online check in - no option to choose seats. Check-in in Dublin could not issue boarding passes for 2nd leg. Hour long queue in Abu Dhabi to find in 2 random B seats in the cabin for me and my wife! Give me a break. If I book same flight with VA I can assign seats for both carriers. and that is exactly what I will be doing in the future.

They are certainly the EasyJet/Jetstar of long haul travel and know how to cram as many seats and few toilets into their planes especially the A330s. Having said that for the price it was good being $2000NZD cheaper for the 3 of us than the similar route with Emirates and to the UK with other airlines. The flights were good times and on time the staff were friendly and our vegetarian and child's meals were fine. I would use them again if the price was right.

The whole experience from booking to traveling, to end destination is very professional and easy. I had to make changes to my return journey, so I called Qatar (after hours my time), my call was answered straight away, the lady said that she could make change for me (AUD $60) or alternatively I could do it myself online (AUD $11). I chose to change myself online, very easy. As for my flight this week, PER-DOH-LYS, it was great, even though it was in economy, the food was much better that other airlines flown recently. I'll definitely be choosing Qatar where ever possible in the future."

S Parker",,2nd November 2023,Business,Business Class,London to Luanda via Doha,June 2023,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  I should state the inflight crews are nice and the aircraft are nice, however, when things go wrong, this airline is the worst I have ever experienced and does not care if customers face issues. I recently undertook a Business QSuite Trip from from London to Angola for the cost of circa £5000 and the biggest problem was as a result of an initial 6 hour delay due to problems with the aircraft, we missed the second Qatar Airways flight. As a result Qatar gave us no options but rerouted us down to Johannesburg and then up to Angola. This resulted in a 17 hour journey becoming 32hr, but the biggest problem was the Qatar booked some of this via an alternate airline organised by Qatar Airways, which I can only describe as ancient and worrying. This was meant to be a QSuite flight and was chosen so I could work en-route, arrive refreshed and get to work straight away. I wrote to Qatar Airways on my return and they paid out the initial compulsory delayed compensation and then gave a very generic ""Sorry, we take your feedback seriously"". I have made no progress getting any sort of resolution, all you can get is the generic response). The entire AV system didn't work on one flight - I couldn't charge my laptop on one flight.  Overall, the very worst customer service ever experienced."

Modern aircraft, A350-900Q. On time. Check-in became a hassle, as there were no transfer counters and I had to shift terminal by arriving with Saudia. I was forced to pay for a transit visa, 150 USD, despite I was never on landside and had only 1 hour transit time. This scrupulous exploitation is unacceptable, just taking advantage of people in rush. QR have no transfer desk nor transfer service in a big international airport to where they are flying several times per day. The good thing is that they, upon my request, at least reopened the check-in counter allowing me to check-in even after the minimum time of 60 minutes had elapsed. A lady behind me was also late, but disallowed to check-in, contrary to me. So, at least I got some premium for my hefty visa fee. Boarding was smooth, despite the flight was fully stuffed apart from an empty seat next to me. No alcohol served onboard with reference to a holy national day in Riyadh. Onboard, served a cold mezze meal, mine was still frozen. Only a single service round, and no service the last full hour prior to landing. Jetbridge provided in both ends. WiFi complicated but not working, a big waste of time trying to connect."

Transit in Doha went well with some testing of their new gold/platinum lounges. The lounges and airport are overstaffed to my taste. To the extend they are about to become intrusive as they have too little to do. Transfer and revised seat selection was easy with new robot machines in the lounges. After the machine reads your passport, you get full overview and can print out new BP yourself. Impressive. Short evening flight, less than 1 hour duration. Huge aircraft, virtually full (300 pax?). Briefly on time. Gate boarding functioned well through division of passengers into 4 zones. I was treated with respect and served excellently. Food and drinks were informed online prior to travel, which had raised my expectations. And, it was all there: served a nice, cold Arabian mezze, nicely prepared and presented in a transparent design box separated in food sections with a spoon fixed elegantly across the sections. Softdrinks numerous, but surprisingly, cava “champagne” was served as well as wine, spirits, and beers. Two catering service rounds in 55 minutes is impressive. Staff competent, focused, polite, and extremely efficient. They gave me 3 seats due to my Privilege status at their FFP. Headset, blankets given. IFE and WiFi functioned well, was given a headset of good quality. Even if I would have been offered a free business class seat, I would not have changed it for my given 69G seat. I have a full appreciation and pleasant experience from this flight and cant fault anything. FA were well groomed, well rested, and in a transmitting, sparkling mood. I spoke Thai with a hostess, Ms. Pisolaya, who was outstanding. Qatar delivers top notch at times, particularly in the air. Well done QR!"

Food ex BKK great, service and comfort on the glorious A380 good as always. Transfer at Doha airport disappointing. The booked AlMaha transfer service did not show up at the gate (still waiting for a response from them since this happened for the third time this year!) Lounge very crowded with no chance to have a shower since the waiting time was over an hour and my transit was just 1.5h. Departure gate to Brussels was at one of the dreaded bus gates on the ground level. Chaotic unorganized boarding, with stressed and shouting gate agents. It’s simply no fun to go on a 30 minutes bus ride at 2 am in the morning. Most of my flights to Europe departed from a remote stand this year; that’s not what I expect from a world class airport. Flight to Brussels on a newish B789 with the new suite seating which I find too narrow and feels claustrophobic. Food was average ex Doha. Prior to my departure, I tried to book my meal ex Doha via the app, which did not work. I sent an email to customer service, but was told that that issue got nothing to do with them and therefore won’t be able to assist. No attempt was made to forward my issue to the IT department, or simply letting me pick my meal choice manually. I like flying Qatar, but the issues on the ground and it’s poor customer service are a big letdown and does not justify the premium airfare I’ve paid."

Qatar really need to either renovate or replace these, as the cabin on this one was really showing its age and was very tired, including a non-functioning seat next to me (was only able to be in full recline mode) and the dated, but very large in flight entertainment boxes that take up about one third of the available space beneath the seat in front for window seats and aisle seats in the central block of three seats. Toilets were a mess, IFE was limited compared to more modern Qatar aircraft; vastly inferior to the Qatar A380s, 777s etc. Thankfully this is a relatively short flight - wouldn't have wanted to do long haul that's for sure!

Cabin was clean and well-maintained and took a while for the air conditioning to kick in after engine start up, but when it did, wow it was cold! I normally like a cool cabin, as its possible to get warm with a blanket etc., but impossible to cool down if the cabin is too warm, but this was a bit far on the cool side, even with a blanket - maybe it was just me though? IFE is exceptional on these updated/more modern cabins and aircraft was kept clean throughout, including the washrooms. Despite many airlines simplifying food provision since Covid, the food was great, particularly the dessert which as well as being tasty, had a white chocolate in the middle, complete with Qatar branding! Bang on time and unlike every recent experience at Heathrow (my record being a 2.5 hour wait), bags arrived promptly. Could fault anything on this trip aside from the usual gripe about the cramped 10 abreast 777 cabin; great service, clean aircraft, great food, on time departure and arrival."

Breakfast came and flight attendant tried to set up table but could not be done due to position of seat, left me sitting there before I complained to the cabin services manager. They try to fix it, they managed to manually position seat for me but only a few hours to landing.

The Qatar premium lounge at Heathrow is an oasis of calm and the food and drinks are excellent. Some of the staff lacked the polished 5 star touch. Service and comfort on our A380, although not the new q-suites, was excellent. Delicious food for breakfast and lunch. A stark contrast to the poor offerings on our outbound flight. The seats were comfortable. The Heathrow flight arrived at an A-Gate and the Dubai flight departed from C-gate. When we got to the C-gate we politely asked if there was a lounge close to the gate and received a very terse and rude no response from the Qatar Airways lady who was setting up the gate. Business/first passengers were made to hang around for 30 minutes whilst economy class passengers were bussed out to the plane. Not the service we paid for.

Philip Armstrong",,5th October 2023,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Amsterdam to Cape Town via Doha,September 2023,,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,1,no,1,"   It pains me to share this experience as I have always been a big fan of Qatar, having flown on it many times in my career while based in Washington DC and Geneva (business and first class). And, in fact, paid the extra money to upgrade to business class when I retired and returned to South Africa with my wife during the pandemic and it was expertly handled and a very satisfying, secure experience. Checked in at Schipol around noon on Tuesday 26 September travelling QR0274 to Doha, then QR1369 to Cape Town on Wednesday 27 September. Checked in three bags, two were received, and one was not. Reported at CPT on arrival on 27 September and a property irregularity report completed with appropriate supporting information including pics. Since then it has been a nightmare of correspondence and communication with various people in CPT, DOHA and AMS. All to NO avail. No one seems to have the capability, willingness or interest in helping a customer retrieve their missing bag containing valued personal possessions, including our family Holy Bible which is irreplaceable. Apparently the missing bag apparently was traced in AMS and was meant to be loaded on QR0274/29 September to be delivered in CPT on QR1369/30 September. Nothing arrived and there seems to be complete confusion between CPT and Qatar representatives in Doha and AMS. It seems AMS are not responding but I find it hard to believe that Qatar would not physically investigate what is going on at AMS with their baggage handlers, whom I believe are Swissport. I tried Swissport and the Station Manager in AMS but they don't answer their phones. I keep being assured that the bag is on the next flight but nothing. It is now a week since the missing bag was traced and it is just endless communication with people who want nothing to do with the problem and passing the blame to someone else. No one is willing to show any initiative or take accountability."

I was moved further up as they needed my seat for someone with medical problems which I was totally ok with. However the seat 19D armrest was falling apart. Food was very nice, and had a nice sleep. Perhaps on those early morning flights would be nice to have a choice (sticker) saying whether I want to be woken up for food or whether I want to be left sleeping. In terms of inflight entertainment it would be nice to be able to watch Rugby World cup"

No butter or cheese was served.  On the online check-in counter in Muscat i waited more than 25 minutes because one family had immigration issues, since only 1 counter was available."

G Mayle",,1st October 2023,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Jakarta to Athens via Doha,September 2023,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,1,no,4,"  I booked to fly Qsuite business from Jakarta to Athens return. On checking in at Jakarta International airport we had to stand and wait for an hour.  When I raised my concern with the staff, they said it was because they have three flights departing at that time.  The lounge was the Garuda Business lounge that was really awful. The only alcoholic beverages available were unpalatable and inferior products.  The ghastly food offering was substandard and inedible. The lounge was cramped, hot and overcrowded. We left the lounge and used the general access / food court section and bought a decent glass of wine and better food. Four weeks before my return flight, Qatar emailed me to say I can not return from Doha to Jakarta in Qsuite because they changed aircraft to one without Q Suite. If If I still want to fly Qsuite, I must catch an alternative flight 7 hours later and wait 9 hours in Doha rather than about 2. Their rules state that I am unable to enter the Doha business lounge until a few hours before my flight, so the rest of the time, I would be locked out of the lounge. As to their email apology to me for moving my fight to a plane without Q Suite, they said I could choose my own seat in the new plane to get the seat of my choice. I tried. And they will not allow me to book my seat until 48 hours before the flight. "

We flew from Vienna to Muscat via Doha. The aircraft in the 1st leg was Airbus 320, an old aircraft, seats with hardly any space between the rows. The screen was slow with poor resolution. The inflight program was very limited.  There were only 2 toilets for the economy cabin resulting in a long queue post-lunch. How can they use a small aircraft for an almost 5 hour 15 mins flight. A320 may be appropriate for a short flight but definitely not for this flight."

The flight from Doha to Vienna was on an Airbus A320. Both flights were on time and the staff on both flights were very professional and friendly. The food options were above average, and there was a good choice of drink options. I did notice that the entertainment system seemed to have a lot less choice of content than when I last flew Qatar Airways, and the leg room felt a little tighter. Arriving to Doha around 11:00 pm meant a huge crowd waiting to get through security. Doha airport is OK. The flight back to Europe meant taking a bus to the plane and this was a bit of a pain. Both flights were completely full. At Bangkok, I asked at the check in counter whether it was a full flight and the guy behind the desk said that it was overbooked. I guess the remaining passengers got to fly on the next Qatar flight to Doha, which left just an hour and a half after my flight. T I will still fly Qatar Airways and I will still recommend them."

Our stopover in Doha was in the middle of the night and the large impressive lounge is useless: uncomfortable seats to pass 3 hours waiting.

The scores given for seat comfort and cabin staff service are based on previous flights, for reasons given below. We had to cancel our trip due to a family emergency, while we were already in the departure lounge, literally an hour before boarding. We were absolutely distraught because of worry and needed guidance badly for what to do. After exiting the departure lounge and returning to the Qatar Airways check-in counter, one of the staff immediately came to our aid. We had noticed him earlier during check-in attending to passengers queuing for the counters and providing labels for our bags. Not only did he listen patiently to our situation, he also gave clear instructions on how to retrieve our checked-in luggage, as well as when and whom to call in order to manage our flight booking. His calm and sure directions, as well as assistance from other counter staff, helped us tremendously in dealing with the situation. Furthermore, the office that we called regarding our booking attended to our needs very professionally. She explained what we needed to do clearly and repeated patiently when asked to."

Family of 5 with 3 children, pre-booked extra leg room seats and so that we could be together. Our seats were reallocated to a group as we transited through Doha airport. We ended up with seats spread across the entire the aircraft, nowhere near each other. Our 13 year old who’s afraid of flying was sick with the stress caused, and to us as parents worried that if something happened there was no way we could have taken care of our 3 children. Total lack of interest, no customer care, no customer service, no attempt to improve the situation, then lies and fabrication of reasons when we complained at the gate, onboard and afterwards to their customer care team. First they claimed the aircraft had been changed, then that our seats were changed for operational reasons, and then best of all claiming we had missed our flight and had been put on a different plane. Because we complained, we never got a refund for the extra leg room seats. "

Even Qatars Platinum members are not allowed to use their own lounge in BKK. Their contract Miracle lounge was very average to say the least and does not deserve the name. Boarding was well organized. Cabin crew was friendly and efficient throughout the flight. Food was a big letdown, with no more butter for breakfast, no pepper and salt or a small spoon for the dessert or stirring the coffee. The main meal was disappointing in appearance and taste. Internet worked for just 20 min after reaching cruising altitude. Al Maha transfer service worked well this time after the hostess did not show up twice at the aircraft earlier this year. Platinum lounge was great. The short second leg of the trip was uneventful; the virtual entertainment system (their new 738 do not have private screens) did not work throughout the flight.

When we got home I waited for a few days and when I didn't hear from them I contacted them via email.

Cabin crew were always incredibly attentive, responsive, and friendly. On the return, in Economy Class, I also had a two very good flights. Despite only being a Silver member, I was still personally welcomed aboard, and given the opportunity to select my desired meals before meal service.

I was pleasantly surprised to see the concern of the staff regarding the passengers issues. We made a mistake when we checked in to the Geneva airport. We did a hassle free online check in including user friendly seat reservations which helped us to identify seats to our liking and received the boarding pass immediately. However we were confused at the airport as it was our first journey through Geneva airport and did not attend to luggage. At the boarding gate only we realized that we were carrying huge bags with us. When we explained our situation to the Qatar air ways staff they calmly accepted the challenge and attended to our needs immediately without causing us any pain. We are grateful to all the ground staff and crew members at the gate 56 at 16.10 on the 2nd September for their concern. Even while serving us cabin crew members were polite to check on us to make sure that everything regarding our bags is OK. This shows their genuine interest in the well being of the passengers which they may have gained through exemplary training or/and air line may be selecting the ideal people having humanely qualities.

Adrien Rousseau",A350,5th September 2023,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Auckland to London via Doha,September 2023,2.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,,2,no,5,"  Although I booked an aisle seat, I was given a middle seat at check-in without anyone mentioning the change, so I had the surprise when I boarded the plane. The flight attendants were very nice and apologetic and tried to find a solution but since the flight was full there wasn't much they could do. I am aware that sometimes there is a last minute change of aircraft and all the seats are changed, but I believe this was not one of these situations because my neighbours on either had the seat they had booked even before I booked mine. I strongly suspect that this happened when I upgraded my return flight to business class, a glitch in the system cleared my seat selection for the outbound journey. I wrote to Qatar Airways about it, and they replied that they are free to change seats at any time, including after boarding. There wasn't enough food, 2 meals and one sandwich, and my vegetarian ovo-lacto meal was a vegan meal. There also seemed to be some confusion among the staff, a couple of times they served me a regular meal and then took it away to give me the special meal.

Mould on the ceiling and interior, badly cleaned surfaces.  Will not use them again in the future unless they improve. The airport was decent enough. I'm giving them a score this high because of the onboard staff who did the best they could."

The onboard the personal service was fantastic especially Maria and Stephanie they really took care of the passengers. The IFE was not working on my seat 1A and WI-FI was patchy but it was nice to experience the Qatar Airways A380 again.

M Masi",,29th August 2023,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Montreal to Tehran via Doha,August 2023,4.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,,4,yes,8," I asked for a low salt menu, instead of actual food and desserts I got mostly small portions of vegetables (cucumber, tomato) and fruits. I don't think chocolate cakes or tiramisu have salt in them and excluding them from my menu was a turn off. Also the portions of my food were very little. "

The seat was quite uncomfortable in terms of seat width and legroom. The cabin crew service was spotty, the headphones handed out when boarding was not working and it took 3 hours for the crew to find me a replacement headset. "

The seat is amazingly comfortable, though I did not sleep since it was a short 3.5 hour hop. The cabin crew was extremely attentive and took every effort to make your flight wonderful. Excellent food, great wine list, warm and attentive service made and the nice IFE screen to enjoy movies made it one of the best flights till date. The selection of entertainment is not well-curated."

DFW to Doha was q suite. Good service good food and a comfortable sleep. Doha to Joburg 787 lie flat. Not as comfy but slept fine good service. It was a very good business class product but in no way best ever. I got lucky and my upgrade was less than original ticket.

T Marelli",,26th August 2023,Family Leisure,Business Class,Singapore to Zurich via Doha,August 2023,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1,no,1,  I and my wife had Business Class tickets. I was offered an upgrade in the app on checkin for my 3 daughters. After paying for it I realised that the upgrade was only for the segment from Doha to Zurich.  I therefore requested either an upgrade for the whole trip or a refund of the amount paid and return to economy. Customer service (center not managed by Qatar) answered that I was wrong and I should have read the terms and conditions. Refused any of the two options.  In Doha we try and access the Business Class lounge. No access for my children as the tickets were upgraded and not full Business class. Qatar Airways website places the cost of access to the lounge at 450dr 59% off for children. No mention of the fact that an age restriction applies to minors between 12 and 17 which are not considered children. All these rules applied in a very strict manner with no flexibility.

Prime Class lounge was rather underwhelming with poor breakfast choices, but nice outdoor seating. Flight to Doha was downgraded from Qsuite to normal seating quiet some time ago. Flight to Doha was very good with great catering and good service. Arrival in Doha at a remote stand. The Al Safwa lounge food has improved. Flight from Doha to BKK by the all Thai cabin crew was great, catering not as good as the previous flight.  After all, reasonably ok flights, but nothing special considering what I paid for. "

S Morten",,22nd August 2023,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Berlin via Doha,July 2023,4.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,4,no,4,"  I had an upgrade offer for two persons for Business Class for booth flight sections in my app. After paying I got the message that it was not possible. I thought it was a bug, so I updated my APP content and got the upgrade offer again. I paid again and received the information a second time that it was not possible, after booking on my credit card. These amounts were blocked not just once, but twice each. 8,272 EUR from Qatar Airways were blocked on my card for a whole day. At the business check-in counter, no one could understand what had happened. Only reaction was please write a mail to Qatar Airways.  I have never experienced such bad service. In the flight from Doha the climate was not working. After more than an hour of waiting in unbearable temperatures on the plane, a glass of water was served without a word of apology why it was so hot on the plane. After about 3 hours the temperatures become somewhat bearable. Writing an E-Mail on August 4th to Qatar was more then useless. Qatar Airway told me it was a ""due a system error"". Nothing about the very bad untrained Service on the ground and in the Air. As a Frequent Flyer you get a welcome on board but no Service to solve Problems. "

Qatar Airways is known for its excellent service in general, but some flight crew do a much better job than others.

Excellent service provided as usual. Crew always very good to top notch depending on the route. Airplanes always new an well maintained. The seat was amazingly comfortable, much better than QSuite that feels a little claustrophobic. PJ's handed out even into a day flight, the F/A also gave to me an extra one for the following leg. The food was very fresh and tasty. The transit in Doha was also smooth, even though if your flight is parked not at the finger you may have a little time to spend on the bus to the terminal. Priority lanes for security work very well and the staff always with a smile. The business class lounge Al Mourjan was full of staff and very helpful. The buffet restaurant is a nice touch with plenty of choice. QR will be my first choice from Italy to UAE, much better than EK. QR staff really knows how to engage with their customers in a warm and authentic manner to make you feel welcome and valuable."

Christopher Geerdts",,19th August 2023,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Doha to Cape Town,August 2023,1.0,3.0,2.0,,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Most disappointing flight I've had for several years. Baggage damaged and Qatar refuted saying I left it too late and already went through customs. In fact I had gone straight from the carousel to the baggage claim. Both my meals were inedible. Power supply for laptop was old and plug kept falling out. We booked a month early and checked in early but got horrible centre seats. The problem was the online check in wouldn't let me change them. I had to phone and was told I had to pay $100 to change the seat. At checkin I tried again but first leg was Finnair and they couldn't change the seat. Then we tried when we got to Doha, before security and there was a long queue of other people also trying the same - we were 30 minutes in the queue and they said they couldn't change but someone else said to try at customer service. There was another long queue and this time they said there were no spare seats available any more. Was promised an hour of Wi-Fi as a prestige member but every time I tried it said satellite not available."

Flying with Qsuite from Jakarta to Doha was exceptional. The cabin crew was friendly, helping a lot, always checking with us if we need help. The Food taste is just amazing for my 2 meals. The Entertainment also updated and had a lot choice for a long trip. Just like mini apartment when flying in Qsuite. Unfortunately, from Doha to PHL, they changed that into regular Business Class in 2-2-2 Configurations. The services are still great for 13 hours flight."

On time. Flew on QR award tickets; selected my favourite seats free due to Frequent Flyer status. Quick check ins. Lounge in Hanoi spacious and good. Onboard, menu had 3 choices of hot meal, all announced 10 days prior to departure on QRs homepage. Transfer in Doha smooth with lounge access (Gold Lounge Gate C14). The flights were faultless and excellent for economy class. FAs were energetic, well rested, groomed, and in a sparkling mood. Drinks were generously served throughout the flights, up to 3 drinks per person per round. Food was good with 3 hot options on each sector, though small portions. Further were sandwiches and snacks served and/or obtainable on request. Both flights were de facto full; this challenges were handled well by the crew who knew how to focus without panicking. IFE worked well with on touch screens, huge supply of movies. Amenity kit and kids toys were given to all who wanted. Decent wines for economy: sparkling was a decent French crémant: Veuve Ambal Chardonnay/Aligoté (30 usd/bottle). White wine was acceptable: Frontera Chardonnay 2022, Chile. Red wine was very good: Maison Robert Olivier Syrah, France. Sodas and beer brands were substandard as usual: the cheapest industrial stuff, sells for max. 1-2 USD/can. Was recognised and further pampered as elite frequent flyer of QR. Only down fall are the very conservative and conform food offerings and the tedious bus-gating in Doha, depriving passengers any premium feeling. Luggage failed to be loaded in Hanoi depriving me comfort on the subsequent numerous flights. Could only file PIR-report at final destination of my entire travel, in Copenhagen. Luggage still not recovered, but I trust it will come soon. Will fly QR again, however."

Qatar Airways was very average, and on occasions below average, on these flights. Chairs were not great, especially the entertainment console under the chair in front of you.

Our first flight to Doha had new business class seats - very good ones. Long haul was in Q-suite, an amazing experience. They call it 1st class in business and I confirm it. Service was immaculate. Flight was in time and we arrived earlier than planned to Singapore. Choice of meal and drinks are very good. Staff treated us like kings. There were new releases of movies and cartoons and particularly Sing 2. We had Al Maha VIP platinum service in Doha and I strongly recommend to have it to everyone since Doha is huge airport.

Jeroen Mutsaars",Boeing 777,27th July 2023,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Manchester to Jakarta via Doha,July 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,no,2," On this trip, my outbound flight from Manchester was delayed by a passenger becoming ill. Whilst I sympathise with a passenger, falling ill, of course, a speedier decision would've saved me from missing connections, which we inevitably did. We sat on the plane for an hour and 45 minutes, whilst it seemed the captain dithered over whether or not to offload the passenger. He did not offload them. Upon arrival in Doha, 15 minutes after my connection had already departed, I was handed a new ticket for a flight which left at 02:25, 7.5 hours later with no apology for the inconvenience caused. There was a flight leaving for Jakarta at 8 pm via Singapore, but I was not offered that option. There was another flight leaving at 08:25 the next morning which would have suited me best, but I was not offered that choice either. I asked if I could go into a hotel for the night to rest properly before taking the 08:25 flight in the morning. They advised me that because my delay was 'less than eight hours' (it was 7.5 hours.) I was not entitled to a hotel. The business lounge in Qatar is not designed for lengthy waits so I asked if I might enter the first-class lounge at least for the duration of my wait given that the delay was the fault of the airline. I was refused because I am 'not a member' When eventually we finally left Doha on that 02:25 flight, I was exhausted and my seat was next to the galley where I heard the crew banging, talking and generally being noisy. I have never experienced such a disengaged crew as this one. The media on the video system did not correspond with the series being advertised i.e., the new series of White Lotus that I was looking forward to watching, whilst being labelled as the latest one set in Sicily, in fact, was the original series which is  a few years old.

I was able to change my flights back to Qsuites by changing flights, but had to accept a 12h layover at Doha airport. Since I can sleep on overnight flights in the Qsuite only, I accepted the offer. Unfortunately both flights were downgraded again, I was informed about the Bangkok to Doha sector 3 days ago, and about the Doha to Zurich sector just 6h before the departure of the flight.  I was up to now willing to pay more, since Qsuites are in high demand and rates were this time around €350 higher than other configuration. When I requested compensation for the previous flights, since I paid a premium for those Qsuite bookings too, I received 2 identical pre-written standard responses saying that they were not willing to compensate, not even with some Qmiles. I am really upset, since the Qsuites are promoted everywhere on the booking app, but what’s the point of booking a Qsuite if I don get it! One of the mentioned flights was my 100th on Qatar, about 70% in Business class, but it never happened that there was a aircraft change from an old configuration to Qsuite, only the other way round. On a lighter note, the flights were outstanding, esp. the Bangkok to Doha sector (QR839) with great food and service. I want to thank especially the wonderful and hard working Purser and her team. I can’t really recommend Qatar at this point, since the hardware problems are getting from bad to worse. "

I was assured that it would be, but to my dismay, the new connection flight was also delayed by an hour, extending my layover to a 6 hours. I spent an additional 2 hours waiting in a queue to inquire about the whereabouts of my luggage, to discover that it had never left DOH. I was told it would be delivered to my accommodation by morning, yet to this day, it has not arrived, leaving me without essential items. The level of service has left me utterly disgusted. "

Good thing I went to NAIA cause I thought its going to rain and it might cause traffic! Started forming our lines at 5:30pm and counters open exactly 5:50pm fir the 11:20pm flight. Check in process was quiet slow, despite my Silver Status I left the counter at 6:40pm. Understandably only two counters were open since the other check in staff are assisting the 6:35pm departure. Anyway, though it was slow but OK since the clerk was super nice and offered me a complimentary lounge pass! The plane departed around 15 minutes later than published but was able to overcome and arrived earlier in Doha! Was a very smooth landing and the crew were all warm! Food served dinner and breakfast were both sumptuous and delicious! I was seated on a window seat and was quiet cramped because the guy beside me was humungous. Arrival in Doha was as expected very warm and pleasant, security check was fast and quick! A separate lounge for Silver members were provided, and was surprised of its huge size, very comfortable, good food, very clean comfort rooms! Went to the gate early as it was quiet far but thanks to the sky train, I was at my gate in seconds! Fortunately, I was upgraded to Business Class on the second leg of the journey! It was a very pleasant experience considering the 13 hours flight to Montreal! Everything went perfectly well! The very comfortable Q Suite, the award winning Catering and the Best Crew Services contributed to an overall pleasant experience!

During 2020 with the COVID outbreak, my then carrier of choice stopped flights to and from Johannesburg, South Africa. Qatar Airways was the first airline that resumed flights from South Africa and by times the flights were less than 10% full, but Qatar kept on flying and that bought my loyalty. In addition to the above, why do I continue with Qatar Airways? Flights always on time (very important for me!) ground and flight personnel professional and friendly, Doha transit very quick and efficient even with numerous flights disembarking, providing socks, eye masks and toothpaste kits for even Economy class, food and drinks served of good quality, and lastly - flight schedules work out perfect for me."

Upon landing in Doha, met by a member of ground staff holding a sign, upon asking if the Manchester flight had departed she said yes. Next flight was in 6 hours - the compensation provided was the equivalent of 10GBP - to spend over the 6 hour wait (a coffee alone was 5GBP). Didn't give access to a lounge. Again, customer service upon receiving the 'compensation' and my next boarding pass was poor - no smile, no apology for the inconvenience. I asked out of curiosity why my bag needed to go through a security check when I'd just come from the plane - the response was that the previous airport flying from could have missed something. When flying flying back from Manchester on the return flight via Doha I didn't pass through any security checks to my connecting flight. One plus point to the flights - food is great, hats off to the chef. My TV on the return flight from Manchester to Doha was also not working. "

First time flying Q-Suite of Qatar Airline, have heard many good things about it prior to departure which turned out to be exactly as advertised. You get your own spacious suite, comfortable seat, plenty of storage, great food, all are better than other business class experiences that I had. What really went well beyond my expectation was the cabin crew. From the time I boarded they have always been super attentive with prompt service of what I needed. Special Kudo to Amit the supervisor, Hattaya who handled my section with a smile that can light up the cabin, plus Chenny and Asil who both were in the front (Apologies to the rest of the wonderful crew whose names I didn't quite remember) Moreover, the lounge in Doha is just fantastic. There have been plenty of praise about the facilities so I am not going to repeat here. However I really want to point out that all the staffs are well-trained and always proactively helping out asking for our needs, which is not something I experienced in most of the business class lounge. They were also very serious about the work product they delivered. We ordered a steak at the dining room that turned out to be too well-done and not tender, we made a very slight comment about it and five minutes later the Chef came out and explained to us that they deliberately didn't leave it too rare and we are all travelers so they want to be on the safe side. The only drawback is the inflight WIFI. $10 for a full flight plan is very reasonable so I purchased it right on board. However after I napped the system could no longer recognize me so I had to make another purchase. Again this isn't a huge amount but with everything being top-notched this is a bit surprising and disappointing."

The desserts are basically yoghurt!! Seriously yogurts are desserts?? I flied from Boston to Qatar. Qatar to Dhaka and then return from Dhaka to Qatar, Qatar to Boston. Almost in every meal food was not tasty! Disgusting foods! Means Qatar does not have good food culture! The bread they provide is so hard, that even the dogs of USA will not eat! My kids couldn't eat anything from the flight. My son has autism so we signed for the DPNA code. When we checked in looked like the staffs do not even know what is that! I didn't find any special accommodation for DPNA code provided by the Qatar Airways. We had hard time making them let us take the stroller with us as we had 8 hrs transit time in Qatar! I traveled so many other airlines. Emirates is still the best. No where near them! I will give it 2 star!"

CX),21st June 2023,Business,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Bangkok via Doha,June 2023,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,2,yes,5,"  Frankfurt Terminal 2 checkin and security check was swift and friendly. Contract Lounge rather average. Flights uneventful, crew on the second leg was rather stressed. Why wake one up for breakfast three hours prior to arrival on a 6h night flight? Seats were cramped, slightly better on the CX aircraft. What was very annoying was the fact that the ex Cathay aircraft did not have the usual 4000+ choices entertainment system (which was even promoted after departure), but a different interface with about 35 random movies and shorts and no Audio programs.

Problem is customer service on the phone. They don't speak or understand English very well. When you ask for supervisor because you've called several times and they're not understanding, they give you a hard time and say the supervisor can't do anything and try to get you to not transfer. After insisting they put you on hold for 15+ minutes only for the supervisor to get on the line for a few minutes, and every time I called they hang up mid way through the call. They said an investigation would take 24-48 hours, it took 1 week."

We were given a 45 QAR voucher which wasnt enough for a water and slice of pizza so we had to pay for the difference. On top of that the hostesses were constantly hounding us over having our feet in our shoes (which is a bad idea since feet start to smell inside shoes and disturbs other passengers). All in all I got the experience I would get in a budget local airline and I'd rather pay more using a different airline than to experience this again.

There was a family of adults in front of us. As the plane took off, the man put his seat in full recline position and did not move during the flight. I had to put my legs under the seat next to him thus preventing my daughter and my wife from sleeping. I tried to tell him several times no answers. When i realised the family father was next on the right i showed him politely. He looked down on me in a very protective way. The staff did nothing on this flight but on the second part of the flight on the second plane another guy got reminded to put his seat in standing position whereas he just moved down the seat a little bit for few minutes. Good point: the food is nice and the videos too."

Smooth cooperation with their partner Rwandair by whom I arrived with in Doha early morning coming from Kigali. Luggage transfer went smooth, arrived quickly in Hanoi. In Doha I had 12 hours layover; I was eventually denied a hotel stay but had lounge access to their decent Platinum lounge. Onboard, recognised as elite traveller and was well pampered by professional attendants. They secured me 3 seats in a row by applying seat-block for me as elite flier. The plane was not fully occupied as this is a new, additional flight on this route. IFE of high class and movies renewed frequently. Food onboard improving for QR: 3 offerings at dinner, of which I had two dishes of beef, which was excellent. Beers were of ridiculous poor quality, wines were fair, including a sparkling Spanish cava. The wineglasses are so small that they embarrass the passengers. They hold 5-8 cl only. The wineglasses on my previous flight, Rwandair, are 4 times larger. Amenity kit given though rather useless. A hot snack was offered before morning landing in Hanoi. Recommended, can't demand much more for economy class. But bring onboard your own slippers, and headset. Qatar Airways' tickets have become too expensive during Corona."

Because of this, I had to run for my connecting flight. The old 788 on the 2nd leg of the journey was in a rather poor sate and not clean.

Regular service and aircraft toilets were not very clean. Our tickets departing from Canberra were cancelled and no refunds were made. We had to spend additional money to get to Sydney. We also paid extra for departing from Canberra. It was time consuming and difficult to deal with customer service to get a new flight. My husband and I paid for tickets separately and he asked for them to be linked. I would have expected this to happen after both our flights were cancelled however this was not the case. This resulted in our seats being separated for our honeymoon. We had to arrive much earlier than necessary at the check-in counter so staff could assign us seats together. We had to spend additional time at the service desk on top of check-in to resolve this issue. In summary, we have spend extra funds, lost money and received a lower than expected experience. We'll definitely consider other airlines in the future."

I would say that onboard services and staff are as good as it gets and ground service and staff are the complete opposite.

The baggage allowance for business class is 40 kilos. The fee for extra baggage ranges from 10£/kilo up to 18£/kilos depending on the time you purchase it. They forgot one of my special diet meals on of my flights, providing me with  the breakfast on an overnight flight where 2 meals were offered (late dinner and breakfast). What made things worse was the Stewardess trying to convince me that because I ordered the special meal I only get breakfast! Then the supervisor came over to admit the mistake and apologise.

Ground staff, lounge staff and on board crew always took extra the step to make my journey better. All flights departed and arrived on time. Food and Beverage options were excellent on board as well in the lounges. My only negative comment might be on boarding practices in Manila. There is a boarding card and passport check prior to entering boarding gate which is same as everywhere else. After this scanning the boarding card before boarding the aircraft which is also same but there is one more person only who checks the boarding card on the link bridge and finally the on board crew. I do not think it is necessary to perform 4 different checks. This also causes a long queue on the link bridge."

We booked our return ticket from Manchester to Delhi via Oneworld (British Airways). However, mid-holidays, BA changed our booking and got us removed from our previously booked flight from Doha to Manchester. Despite multiple calls from me and my partner they could not resolve it and kept on promising us that it will be resolved in ""next 24hrs"". Lastly they told us that it will be sorted by BA airport staff at DEL airport. So we were hopeless to be stuck midway in a country/airport (Doha) which is neither the destination (Delhi, India) nor the home country (Manchester, UK). So with our last resort, we reached DEL (IGI airport) 6 hrs before with the hope to sort it out with the BA airport staff and stood in BA queue. We were asked to change queue to Qatar one. Upon talking to the Qatar airport staff, they told us that they are trying and also connected us to the BA airport manager who turned us away saying that there was nothing he could do. While we were explaining to him the whole issue and he was continuously telling us ""there was nothing he could do"", we could see the Qatar staff Senior Airport SVCS Agent  continuously on call and indicating/placating at us that she's trying. Disappointed, we turned to Qatar staff and their agent Aarti sorted us out on the ticket. As soon as she did so, we took her name and thanked her.

The purser welcomed every customer in the QSuite section with their name and a quick informal chat which I found very pleasant because this practice seems to have been abandoned by a lot of other airlines. Then, the stewardess took our food and drinks orders and asked us when we would like to eat. She also explained the features of the QSuite seat. Food was tasty and of high quality.

My ticket and my trip were deleted from the app and had to be redone at the airport, with the trip never reappearing on my app nor the option to review them. Arriving in Doha, the ticket had to be redone a second time and I was forced to show them receipts for my purchases. Flights were enjoyable but I will never fly them again. "

Economy will always be economy, but with Qatar it is at least reasonably comfortable. Pretty good leg room, seat comfort fine, IFE has a good selection and the food was of a good standard. Standout for me though was their punctuality. All flights left right on time and arrived bang on time. Boarding process is organised and the crew were welcoming."

Earlier I traveled from DFW to DOH in Business class. Cabin crew who was serving us is Rania. Rania was such an outstanding cabin crew, she was very warm, welcoming, accommodating and went above and beyond to make the flight experience pleasant. While serving dinner, they ran out of my preferred meal, she made sure that her colleagues on the other isles had my preferred meal and she brought it to me. Although I traveled in Economy class from Doha to Dhaka, her genuine care and warm disposition made me feel like I was traveling in Business class. She definitely upheld the standard that Qatar airways promise it's clientele and boast about! Thank you Rania, and thank you Qatar airways!"

B Stauffer",Boeing 777,15th April 2023,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Doha to Johannesburg,April 2023,2.0,5.0,2.0,,4.0,,2,no,2," The aircraft was changed at the last minute to an ancient one, with a seating configuration of 2-2-2 instead of 1-2-1 Q-Suites. Offering that kind of configuration for the same price as a Q-Suite is just robbery. Anyway, the crew was great and always willing to help. On the catering side, despite the flight leaving at 2am Qatar should in my opinion have a couple of full meals available for passenger who do not want to sleep right away. The only options were soup or salad or cheese. Given the age of the aircraft, the air was very dry and I could barely sleep.  In the future, I will avoid their ancient 777 at any cost!"

The aircraft was new, and the service from the flight crew was great...nothing to fault. The meal quality was impeccable, and they have decent selection of non alcoholic drinks (I cannot drink for medical reasons). One of the best flights overall. But the experience was trashed by the arrival in Doha, as the aircraft got a parking space in the middle of nowhere, followed by a 45 minute bus ride to the terminal."

John Duffus",Boeing 777,14th April 2023,Business,Business Class,Doha to Bangkok,March 2023,4.0,2.0,3.0,,5.0,,4,yes,7,"  I love QR's Q Suites. This was the second sector of a flight from the UK. As usual service and in flight offerings were excellent - apart from one thing. Generally I have never worked out why QR pilots announce the start of descent about an hour before touch down when in fact the aircraft does not start descending until about 25 minutes beforehand. In this short overnight flight of less than 6 hours, that cuts sleep time. Specifically, this is the second time I have had QR flight attendants prior to departure take my breakfast requests and serving time, and then get it hopelessly wrong! This time I wished merely coffee, juice and two croissants with marmalade as late as possible. I was asked if this meant about two hours or one hour prior ro landing. I stated one hour. When I was wakened, I discovered it was two hours prior to landing. I then waited about 20 minutes before another FA tried to set up my table for a full breakfast. Asking her to look at the request sheet, there was no apology. Eventually I got an orange juice and a full bread basket with just one croissant. Asking for a second croissant, yet another full bread basket arrived. Only later when I had finished the croissants and juice did the coffee appear. When so much else is so good, this is surely a major error on an overnight flight. It certainly left me in a less than good mood"

Our experience was average overall. We flew on 787-8's, 777-300ER, and A350-1000. Seats were good quality and design, but narrow on the 777 especially (10 seats across) even though the leg-room was good. The newest of their aircraft was the best to fly on - the A350, with a roomy and airy feeling, with high ceiling. The in-flight experience was mostly good, but they could be more generous with drinks and snacks between meals. Children don't always eat at the designated times during the flight. The worst part of our experience was the structure of the ground service and connections. We had to re-check our bags in Tokyo for the domestic flights, security checks in-transit in Doha, buses for the Dublin flight in Doha, and QR don't issue boarding passes for the JAL domestic connection.  Overall, I might fly on this airline again but I don't see anything specific that stands out and would convince me to always choose them over a European airline in the future."

This review refers to both legs which were in B777-300ER aircraft. I have previously flown Qatar business class, including their Q-suites, but this time flew economy on all sectors. I did have Sapphire lounge access but this is not the same as their business lounges which they reserve exclusively for their full fare paying business class passengers. The planes were full. I mean, literally every seat taken. Considering this, Qatar Airways were outstanding. I have occasionally flown with other airlines on full flights and it can be chaotic, even unpleasant. Not with Qatar whose staff took everything in their stride. The food was excellent for economy class. Would I fly economy again? For two roughly 7-hour legs, probably yes. Really, Qatar Airways make economy long haul bearable. Superb level of service."

Anders Pedersen",A380,13th March 2023,Business,First Class,Bangkok to Doha,March 2023,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4,yes,8,"  The perks of flying First with QR is the lounges and onboard tranquility. The rest is nothing special. Even using my miles I would refrain to use them on 1st unless I had to forego them. Their excellent business class makes 1st class almost superfluous. The product is conservative, amazing space, and care level as the pax desires. QR markets their 1st class as a “relish the myriad of exclusive offerings”. Business class is similar (better?) and provides better value for the money. A single spoon of Pearl caviar doesn’t make it. The original can was displayed upon request. Sparkling wines in First are expensive, branded Rare and Alexandra (both ex. 2006), but Business has 2 fine champagnes, which are cheaper and good.  The interior of cabin is dull, conservative, with brownish un-inspirational colors. Access to Bar is fine but not only a 1st Class privilege. Tried to preselect food for weeks before flying but it does not work from my departing cities. Could not  access a menu in advance. Lounges, food, space, and service is better than business class. Welcome champagnes on board; given kit and a quality pyjamas. Champagnes served are truly expensive in contrast to the meagre, cheap, industrial sub-quality beers they could offer. Leffe was the least poor. On QR, I have never been able to get an IPA or porter beer. Food not much better than business class, a spoon of Pearl caviar and a deshelled, dry lobster hand does not make the justification nor significant difference.  Had hoped for some outstanding food, but it was close to ordinary. IFE fine big screen. Ground and Luggage: QR has ground handling problems. They refused to relabel my bags to final destination. Staff disregarded QR’s partnership with Rwandair, resulting me to lose my luggage transfer to final destination. Neither QR in Doha nor in BKK were willing to fix it. However, Rwandair fixed it eventually and opted to board me but leaving my bags 2 days behind in Doha before next flight to Kigali. Had to accept. Partnerships with Rwandair has problems of non-aligned systems, separate bookings, BPs not issued reversely, luggage transfer failures, no full lounge access reciprocality. BOOKING Very hard to come around vacant award seats in F, so I had to plan an entire journey around a leg found (BKK-DOH) to accommodate it. Award booking with QR took weeks to book, coordinate, manage, and process. Exacerbated by the fact that my QR booking had to fit into another QR award booking with a partner airline (Rwandair). "

I was told that the first sector was a code share from LGW to Doha and would be operated by British Airways I reluctantly accepted this. I got told that on the return journey the Doha to LHR this sector was also going to operated by BA. At this point I told Flight Centre I wanted to cancel all the flights and get a full refund. My travel agent then came back with an offer to change the flight back to a Qatar Airways flight from Doha and to Gatwick which I accepted. We flew on LGW to Doha which was as expected a very average Club experience on an old style BA plane. Doha airport was a nightmare, badly signposted, heaving with people,  Wi Fi was rubbish a very poor experience. Doha to Cape Town in the Q suite is a very nice way to fly. Better than BA first class in many ways. It lived up to expectations and was good news. The day before our return to the UK, received an email from Qatar saying another change of plane and no Q Suite. Could not delay flying back due to commitments. The seat was hard, lumpy and uncomfortable and did not properly go into flat bed position. The staff on board were hugely apologetic but there was nothing they could do. A pretty poor flight to Doha, where we then found the main business class lounge closed and everyone packed into another lounge. The flight to Gatwick not a Q Suite but it was a reasonably modern plane with good service. I wrote to Qatar Airways saying I had not received what I had booked and paid for and got a very polite letter back saying they were not prepared to give me any compensation whatsoever. "

The Wi-Fi didn't work and there were no toilets in this boarding gate. "

P Lansen",Boeing 787-8,19th February 2023,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Dusseldorf to Doha,February 2023,1.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,,3,yes,6,"  I was flying from Düsseldorf to Malé via Doha on Qatar Airways. The service was very professional and at times excellent. The food was mostly decent, definitely above average for Economy. Finally, operations were very reliable. All flights were on time, and the boarding and deplaning processes were well-organized. On the Boeing 787-8 the legroom was awful and restrained by a large inflight entertainment box under the seat in front, the seat was quite hard, and the headrest could not be adjusted on the sides. This seat was probably among the most uncomfortable that I have experienced on a wide-body plane. Overall, I would fly Qatar Airways again if the price is right. But I would not pay a premium for this experience."

I was disappointed as Qatar changed the planes at the last moment and I was really looking forward to traveling in Q Suite, but the journey due to in cabin service was Excellent. Cabin staff Ying and Komal were phenomenal, professional, helpful and super nice, could not ask for a better service.

Seat space is limited, if you take a window seat there is a metal box in front of you. No wifi, no USB, LCD screen has limited brightness / contrast. Entertainment full of 2nd class movies and series. Doha airport lounge access is extremely expensive and restricted, which offered only 2 different dishes. Impossible to find a proper place to relax, only good option was the shower available. I tried to add the cheaper lounge before my flight but was not allowed because you have to do that 48 hours before the flight. Toilets are quite limited, I had to wait in line for 10 min for a toilet booth. Boarding was organized chaos in all 4 flights, especially the last one from Doha to Athens, where we had to had to use buses. Wait in line for a bus to arrive and delayed departure because of that. Check in was OK in Athens, very slow in Bangkok, had to wait 40 min in line. Food and service was fine in all flights but nothing spectacular, for example no sparkling water. Wifi was advertised in the flight from Doha to Bangkok but it worked only from Bangkok to Doha. In all, a pretty average to poor experience."

Very pleasant and accommodating, nothing was too much trouble. Having read the baggage policies many times, and cutting our baggage to a minimum, I was appalled at how many people were over the limit on size, number and weight of the cabin luggage. The cabin staff are having to struggle on moving bags around to get everybody accommodated, they should not be lifting these overweight bulky items to a level higher than they are. Then having to pacify a complaining passenger whose bag was more than the accepted size because they had to move it further down the cabin. I would like to say a big thank you to all the cabin staff that delivered great care and devotion to all in my section D/E 31, They worked wonders."

The transit experience at Hamad international Airport was great, from disembarking the plane, going to the lounge and then boarding the plane again to Islamabad was pleasant and easy. The ground staff were very pleasant, professional and eager to help. Next step on board the flight was equally nice. Would especially like to mention the supervisor from Lebanon who introduced himself to all business class passengers and personally helped the staff. I didn’t eat during the flight as wanted to sleep, but I am sure it would have been a good experience. The best part as always is the Q Suite, it gives you comfort and privacy, I was tired after flying on a long transatlantic flight but still sleeping in Q suite for about 3 hours was worth it. Overall great experience!"

Check-in was a breeze, the service and amenities at the lounge in Doha was exceptional (staff were especially kind). In-flight was outstanding. Minimal number of cabin announcements which were efficiently delivered. Service was attentive without being intrusive. The food served was outstanding. The quantity offered personified the Arab hospitability custom of making sure you were never in want. I can't think of any flight experience where I was provided such comfort and lavished with such attention in such a non-intrusive manner. I was in an oasis of calm, quiet rest. It's going to be very hard to not route my future trips through Doha on Qatar Airways - thank you to the Qatar Airways team - truly exceptional."

Terrible seat pitch. Tiny, faded IFE screens and the dreaded metal box under the seats that takes up half your legroom. And not enough room for carry on luggage if the plane is full. My flight from Doha to Nairobi was packed to the rafters so they were randomly selecting passengers to give up their hand luggage so that it could be put in the hold so as not to overwhelm the overhead bins on board. I had my standard cabin-approved trolley bag which I was told needed to be checked in. I had to remove my electronics and valuables and stuff these in my laptop bag to carry on board. I was given a flimsy zip tie to secure my bag and off it went into the hold. On arrival in Nairobi, it was one of the last bags to make it to the luggage conveyor belt. The flight was a night flight, so I opted to get some sleep rather than wait for dinner. After managing to fall asleep, I was awoken twice to be asked if I wanted to have dinner, which I clearly did not. On the plus side, the flight was bang on time to the minute, only marred by the long wait for baggage on arrival. Nairobi is a busy route for QR (most of their flights are full) so I don’t know why they put such a mediocre airplane type on it. "

Small half cup of tea and one milk sachet. No drinks service separated. IFE nothing near competition and quite small seats. It took a long time for the crew to move with the food service. Warm to hot cabin conditions. Good value for money so that was a saving grace and check in and boarding well organised.

Despite the long flight (21 hours in the air in each direction), every leg was excellent. Seats were comfortable and spacious - with excellent legroom. Even on relatively short 4 hour flights there were pillows and blankets on each seat. IFE was decent, with a wide selection of movies and programmes to choose from. The food was all of a high standard - a good selection (usually 3 choices) of meals, and each was tasty and filling. I was very impressed with the alcohol selection - a sparkling wine (rare in economy class), quality red and white wine, two beers, and a small selection of spirits. Most impressive of all was the service: the crew were friendly, attentive, and polite. Drink runs were regular, and staff were engaging and highly professional. On one leg with few passengers, the staff were wonderful - constantly checking up on us, offering more drinks, proactively offering to make a festive cocktail (in economy class!), and ensuring our comfortable. All flights were on-time, and Doha airport was a pleasure to transit through. I was very impressed with Qatar, and look forward to flying them again."

I paid an extra 90 euros to get into the business class lounge for my 13 hour layover, no where when I selected this option, informed me that the ticket is for only 6 hours in the business lounge.

The new seat is more tight with a tiny footrest, which makes sleeping more difficult, but the sliding door provides more privacy. Service and catering on both flights at a high standard. The usual remote bus transfer in Doha. I can’t recall any airbridge arrival/departure (besides A380 flights) over the past 2 years. Reminds me of the old Doha Airport. Bus transfer took ages this time, because of a very remote position of aircraft and several long stops on the way. The usual stressful transit security check I have not seen at any other airport for years. Al Safa lounge as always a great place to relax and rewind.

Flight on time upon two aircraft type changes. Smooth cooperation with their new partner Rwandair by whom I arrived with in Doha early morning coming from Kigali. The Platinum lounge that I chose in Doha, appears to be the “flagship” among three newer frequent flyer lounges in Doha for Oneworld silver, gold, and platinum card holders. It had a la carte dining, champagne, showers, tarmac view, sleeping areas. Seat prebooked provided and automatically changed to fit into new aircraft type. Due to New Year, flight was full, likely overbooked despite changed to larger aircraft in last Minute. Seat-block or upgrade was not possible. I was respected as frequent flier and given exit row without charges. Dinner details were announced on their homepage already 2-3 weeks prior to flight, what an impressive effort (“Preview Onboard Menu”); they provided 3 options, all found available. I chose Teriyaki chicken and later beef ragout with mashed potatoes, all good. I prefer this proper dinner and do not mind they skipped breakfast. A Spanish cava sparkling wine was offered as one of 3 wines onboard; beers industrial and watery: only Stella Artois and Budwiser. Food concept always with narrow options and slim concepts over the last 15 years. Conservative airline, lacks life, colours, and innovation, though quite predictable and faultless. FAs well-rested, groomed, but deprived of charm. IFE was good with individual quality monitors; quality headsets were provided to all; likewise blankets, pillows, and amenity kits. Aircraft and toilets were well kept. Despite I had a complex booking issued by an online travel agent, it was easy to handle and detail on airline’s homepage. Miles were credited separately to the different airlines' (QR and WB) frequent flier programs without issues. I did not see my luggage in Bangkok: it was transferred smoothly the entire route from Africa to Saigon. This, even it was partly mislabeled at its inscribed origin in Kigali to final destination in SE-Asia with Vietnam Airlines who is in the competing Skyteam alliance. Impressive work by QR who, together with the airport in Bangkok, saved the mistake done by Rwandair in Kigali. I very rarely have had any luggage issues with QR, maybe in 2 flights of 100 – and in these rare cases, they have done their best to assist me. "

There were three changes to our flight. The first was in August 2022. They stated the flight number and time was changed. We agreed to the changes. The next change was September 2022, they stated the flight numbers changed again. The last change was right before we left in October 2022. This time they changed our plane. When we originally chose our flight and seats we knew what the aircraft was. When they changed the plane, we did not. We called and spoke with several agents who were not helpful at all. Once I was able to get someone, they could not tell me the name of the updated aircraft. They just kept saying you have extra leg room seats. From all of the aircrafts I saw, there was no way the seat number I originally paid for on this new plane was extra leg room seats and I was right. When we got to our layover city, I was told that the plane was full and my seats were no longer available. They couldn't upgrade me or give me my money back.  I paid for these seats and I was not upgraded and I had to reach out to after I got home to request a refund. We went on the flight got there and had an awesome time in Maldives. However, coming back was the same, they put two planes that were not full together again and our seats were not available and we had to ride back with no extra leg room on a 12 hour flight. I have filed a report with Qatar requesting my money back on 20th November.  I send email after email, call after call and no help. "

Fortunately the booked Q Suite was provided on the return flight which is really superb. Cabin Crew were also on the ball and provided 1st Class Service. Catering was however a disaster. There was only one starter available and it was inedible: “Creamy Quinoa and Edamame Salad”. Completely tasteless! For the mains 2 Chicken Dishes were on offer. (So much for variety!). I chose the Creamy Chicken Roulade with a bizarre over sweet filling which was really quite horrible. Failed experimental recipe!"

I usually fly business class on longer distance flights with Qatar airways. Quality of service was impeccable and friendliness of staff as well. Same goes for cleanliness of cabin interior and toilet. I took about 10 flights this year with different airlines and Qatar Airways clearly stands out in quality, at check-in as in flight experience."

The food was great and the flight crew very polite and friendly. The transit in Doha was generally ok, but the flight information was somewhat misleading (several flight numbers pointing to the sams flight, no information that the flight stops on route to a different final destination). Flight entertainment was ok, but the touchpads of the Oryx One systems were not working smoothly, in the B787 it was ok, but in the 737 it was barely usable, very disappointed by that. We were very disappointed by the Qatar Airways website and mobile app. How is it possible that a world class airline cannot set up properly maintained online services? The homepage and app crashed several times, didn't accept our discount vouchers that are available to new customers. The chat support is also very poor, as it took us over 1 hour to discuss a simple change of our booking. In general customer service is bad. Our bag was broken upon arrival and we couldn't even find a complaint form on the website, or some E-Mail address."

Afterwards we had to sit at the airport gate for four hours (still counting), no information were given to us, no water.

Older aircraft but very spacious and comfortable. Ordered Gluten Free Meal. Very delicious. Toilets and cleaned regularly Flight crew was fantastic. As for inflight entertainment, my favourite channel was the flight map. Although I prefer they cut the special effects and advertising and just show a plain and simple flight map. Loved their window seat at Economy. If you want to be first to enter the plane, make sure you sit at Zone 1. DOH to FRA on a B787. First thing I noticed was that the seat pitch was very narrow. Especially when the person in front leans their seat back. I feel very claustophobic. I will choose a B777 next time. I wanted to change my meal option from GFML to no special meal but the IOS app did not work. Even Android app and the website did not reflect the change I tried to make.  I was looking for ways to contact Qatar Airways about the error on their app but I can't find any form or email to report the error. My second Gluten Free Meal was a hard piece of bread, vegetarian meals are not healthy because they contain carbohydrates. "

However, on both legs they let us down.  On the 1st leg various dishes and beverages were not available. Service for a couple in the middle seats is bothersome. The staff does not manage to serve the both of us at the same time, despite our request. We have made a lot of flights with QA over the last years and this is most of the time an issue. Staff was not very attentive.  On the 2nd leg it was much much better. However they conducted an aircraft change without assigning seats or give the opportunity to select seats. Staff and service was the expected level: attentive and nice. One notices clearly they are cutting costs and that influences the 5 star experience. The great staff compensates. The transfer was smooth: a wonderful lounge, a good shower. Also important: QA flies ‘on time’. That said: we will certainly fly QA again."

The flight to Male was nice and we received good service. However, on our return flight from Doha to Miami we paid a little extra to chose our seats and ended up sitting next to a man who was more than 2 meters tall in a group of three seats. My wife ended up moving to a row of 4 seats with only one other passenger. My wife hit the flight attendant call button twice and was never checked on. We were only offered water twice outside of meals despite constant video reminders to ""Stay hydrated."" We ended up loitering in the galley chugging fluids, mostly water. At Doha before entering the gate, there was an additional security checkpoint where we were forced to dump two liters of water and there were no fountains or water refill stations before boarding. "

Amazing service pre-flight (both calls ahead of flight answered within 4 rings by a real person), on the ground and in the air. Seats were comfortable (enough so that on my return, and after 40+ years of regular flights to Asia and Africa I slept for the first time, and in each case for a long time). Had a window seat on the exit row each time, as pre-booked. Food was delicious - vegetarian or chicken choices were delicious, filling and fresh - unlike other airlines' meals, I did not feel heavy or greasy after the meal. I felt better rested and relaxed than I do when I fly to Australia from Toronto via the west coast (Vancouver, LA or Houston stops). Simply can't say enough great things about Qatar!"

We've contacted Qatar and someone told us we would still be able to use this voucher but she had to check and we'd hear from Qatar within two days. We never heard from them again. We've called 10 times but nobody really helped us and everyone said something different. In the end we got an email address from the Qatar refund team but we've mailed already 3 times without a reply and one email was a fake one.

In the end, it costs you time, it costs you money and what is more important it costs you your emotional comfort and health. What is even sadder they don't care about it at all. I submitted my complaint right after the unfortunate choice of using their services and never heard back from them (it's been 5 months).

So there will be no lounge access for the evening Qatar flight; something unheard of. When I approached the staff at the gate, they told me that they were not aware that the lounge closes at 16.45.

My first time onboard the ""best airline“ and I wasn’t disappointed. Qatar offers a high level of service and comfort from beginning to the end oft the journey. I was concerned about the chaotic situation at European airports this summer, but check-in and security at Frankfurt were fast and efficient. Transfer at Doha Hamad was very good too. QR’s onboard product is amazing with a professional crew, comfortable seats, good IFE and delicious meals. However meal service was a bit inconsistent: a welcome drink was only offered during the FRA-DOH flight, while only during the SIN-DOH flight there was no coffee service after the meal. And I want to mention that there is a difference between the aircraft types 777-300ER and A350-900. I definitely prefer the A350 because seats are wider, IFE has more content, the inflight map and the ambience / design is better. Overall a very good experience for a low price."

Most of the time the staff was excellent. Special mention for Miguel, he took care of us on QR274 on 22 October. This guy goes above and beyond. If you're lucky to have him taking care of your row, you're guaranteed a good flight. Also, Hyeon Jin on QR 273 on 28 October was very very hospitable. So much potential in this girl. Seats on the QSuite were very comfortable. Staff are lovely. All in all, a pretty good way to get from point A to point B. I do have 2 small issues with Qatar Airways, they seem to have a tendency for last minute equipment change (meaning you might have booked a QSuite flight only to be told later you're getting an older aircraft). But this could be deal breaker for us, they seem to have an inclination to 'take you out' of your chosen seat and place you in a less desirable seat (at least less desirable for you). This even happened after the boarding pass was issued. This has happened to us twice in 3 months, really hope it doesn't happen again."

Today's experience at Doha is the complete absence of professionalism. There should be people waiting for the passengers at the arrival gate, separating the ones with short or missed connection in groups divided by final destination and guiding them to the proper channel to rebook their flight. In today’s experience people were left alone in desperate search of the (now closed) connection gate and they were finally reaching the transfer desk. Here I spent Hours waiting in line in front of the eyes of staff who were bouncing people from 1 operator to the other, never taking any action. The decisions on who to serve and attend were based on who is angrier and shouting the loudest. Some people have been rebooked on the next day flight when there was another one after only 6 hours. At their further inquiring why they couldn’t board on the earlier flight they have been answered with a sorry and invited to line up again to get a 3rd boarding pass printed. "

Nowhere to put your belongings, you have to hold the blanket and pillow on your lap for take off and landing. Seat 23a has the door blocking your legroom so you need to sit at an angle to get any leg room. Our outbound flight was an hour delayed and we weren’t communicated with much.

Seeing Qatar Airways consistently wins awards I was eager to experience it after a 4 year absence. Unfortunately the experience fell short of my expectations. The in-flight entertainment was not available on the Doha to Budapest flight. The captain apologised for it and explained it was a technical problem. The vegetarian option was a frittata from Mumbai to Doha and it was OK (I award the meal 6 out of 10) but the white wine served was warm hence ruining it!! On the Doha to Budapest the food was very bland (4 out of 10). It was carrots and cauliflower in a milky sauce and what was surely a negligible amount of cheese of it was in fact present in the dish at all. It tasted exactly like boiled carrots and cauliflower. There were three trolleys in the back side of the plane hence going in and out if the lavatories was a challenge. Upon arrival at Doha Airport it took a full 20 minutes to open the plane doors. This is probably because we arrived in the morning but an airport that claims to be the world's best airport should get its act together on this front. The business class passengers who were only 5 or 6 passengers disembarked first hence prolonging the wait for those in economy by another 5 to 6 minutes. Despite that the flight was full disembarkation was via one door only (the front door). The bus taking us to the terminal was EXTREMELY cold. It was only 16 Degrees Celsius in Doha on that morning and the air conditioners were on full blast reducing the temperature inside the bus to 8 or 9 degrees Celsius. Because the size of busses for economy and business passengers are the same there was a traffic jam and the relatively short journey from the plane to the terminals in the freezing bus took 10 - 12 minutes. It feels like Qatar Airways treats its economy passengers as numbers on the accounting sheets else one would expect someone at Qatar Airways to at least instruct the bus drivers to switch off these dreadful air conditioners when it is cold outside.

Inflight staff seemed better organised, but rather than risk a re-run of the chaotic F&B service on the inbound journey, I opted to sleep as soon as we had taken off, and not be disturbed for any F&B until or unless I decided I wanted it. This proved to be the correct strategy. I slept for the first 2 hours and then after waking, ordered the ""pulled beef"" burger, which was tolerable. Staff as always were friendly, and extremely eager to please. They expressed the desired level of concern at the abysmal check-in at Madrid operated by Iberia. Having checked-in online, but gone to the Business Class check-in desk the check in clerk questioned Thailand residency (my final destination) proof, (not required, but which I had in my passport, which he then disputed, until I explained it line by line). He then added luggage tags to 2 bags under my companion's name only, and omitted to put on priority tags. Qatar need to seriously monitor the service they are contracting to Iberia."

Michael Schade",A380/B788,18th October 2022,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Bangkok to Frankfurt via Doha,October 2022,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1,yes,5,"  The first leg was in First on a gorgeous A380, with impeccable service and great food and drinks. Stay at the Al Safah lounge In Doha was great as always. My connecting flight to FRA was at 1 pm, a very quiet time at Doha airport. Despite almost all gates unoccupied, the flight departed from a remote location by bus. It was the usual long wait and chaos at the bus gates, with a hot bus, and overheated plane with cannot cope with open doors on the tarmac. Service and food was ok, but there is no more sandwich service in business class before arrival on this 6h flight. I was offered potato chips or muesli bars, which I declined. I had a seat in row one, and was unable to sleep due to the loud chit chatting of the staff in the galley. Overall, what Qatar is struggling with is consistency on the ground and in the air."

This made our trip quite frustrating. Qatar airways staff and the airport in Hamad made up for this. I recommend flying Qatar Airways. The hostesses were professional and friendly. They treated us like royalty and made sure we were comfortable. Highly recommended.

I upgraded from Economy for a leg of the journey and from the very first minute the red carpet rolled out, the whole check-in and boarding process was done quickly, with ease and the attendants were all super friendly and very helpful. The seats were luxurious, supremely comfortable and made for a totally relaxed flight. The meals provided were the best I have ever had on any airline, truly 5 star cuisine, plenty of options and beautifully presented. I was delighted with the quality, service and price. Having travelled the globe on many different airlines, I cannot recommend Qatar highly enough, they truly are the World's Best Airline and will be my airline of choice from now on. Thankyou Qatar Airways for such a wonderful travelling experience."

Which added to the attentive service by the staff (nothing is too much trouble) plus the quality & availability of the food + drinks are the reason why Qatar Airways business class is the best in the sky. Check-in and boarding is supper efficient for business class passengers, offers of welcome drinks / food options / pyjamas etc from pleasant staff make it a pleasure to fly this airline. There is a reason why Qatar Airways is consistently voted the best in the world and I wish I could afford to fly premium class all the time as it really is worth the extra cost."

W Simpson",A380-800,15th October 2022,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Bangkok to Doha,October 2022,4.0,4.0,1.0,,5.0,,3,yes,5," First time travelling on Qatar in nearly 4 years because of the pandemic. Check-in in BKK a breeze, and certainly not the 3 hours suggested by the airline, especially after online check-in. But onboard service a major disappointment. Meal service was haphazard and chaotic. Was the last to be asked for my first course order, despite being in the middle of the cabin, and they had run out. I opted to forgo it. Instead they provided an ad hoc 1 prawn dish with a slice or two of avocado. The next course took nearly 1 hour to arrive, and I took one look at it when it did, and just ordered a cheese plate instead, finished it and went to sleep. No mattress service on this sector, despite it being night time. My travelling companion on the other side received an equally strange service level. I received my drink order of a glass of champagne, and he received his 40 minutes later. Dinner, such as it was, was completely uncoordinated. However good on paper, the a la carte dining concept does not work, and my suggestion is it should be abolished. The staff were very apologetic and, but seemed very inexperienced. That, and the quality of the food has disappeared since I last travelled and fell in love with Qatar Airways. Overall the staff were trying to solve the problems, but they seemed unable to manage what should be their normal operation. "

W Simpson",Boeing 787-9,15th October 2022,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Doha to Madrid,October 2022,4.0,4.0,1.0,,3.0,,4,yes,7," Immediately changed into provided ""PJs"", and after take off, had the mattress applied to the seat, and went to sleep. Had pre-ordered breakfast prior to arrival, which I was advised would be about 2 hours before decent. Slept well, and awoke about 4 hours later. Was immediately offered breakfast, and assumed it was at the agreed time. A fruit platter with yoghurt and juice was produced. Having taken that, I realised it was 2 hours too early, and I should have slept until the hour before arrival. Cabin staff the usual friendly people, but the quality of food and miserly portion, made me think it would have been best to skip the F&B service, and sleep until descent, for the early (8 am) arrival in Madrid. Like all airlines, Qatar has suffered from the ill-effects of the pandemic, so they are cutting services, but not prices. Hugely disappointed, but hope they can return to the airline I much loved pre-pandemic."

Food is good, service and comfort is good. The aircraft was clean, on time and they have very pretty containers for child meal, which we kept as gifts. I liked the DOHA airport as well. I used the onboard wifi on my way back. It was decent. I The speed was on a lower side but I wasn't trying to stream anything. The options in the movie selection were good. What i would recommend is to have better ""Flight Map"" options. Like some other airlines provide option to change view of what you see in flight map. Also the repeated commercial pages in flight map were annoying. Please leave that experience without ads. "

T Smith",,15th October 2022,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Cairo via Doha,September 2022,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3,no,1," After a 36 hour journey, I arrived at LAX to find that the flight showing confirmed on the Qatar app had no record of my booking. I spent 30 minutes on the phone with Qatar trying to get on the flight. Qatar told me I'd have to stay in LA for 4 days. While we were talking, the flight closed. I ended up paying cash for a ticket home on United. I have another flight with them in 4 weeks. A similar nightmare is unfolding. Rebook for a lower class of service, give up my premium seat on a 38 hour flight or pay cash for my own ticket from Reno to LAX that I already paid Qatar for. Be prepared to be stranded. Make sure you have enough cash to buy an alternative ticket home!"

Affan Butt",A330-300 / B787-8,8th October 2022,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Islamabad to London Gatwick via Doha,October 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,yes,10," I flew a service from Islamabad to Gatwick (London) via Doha. It was a night departure from Islamabad. The Ground staff were very nice and helpful. Check-in was a smooth process, I had exceeded the baggage allowance by a small margin. No fuss created. Flight lifted off on time. The A330 is a bit outdated but good enough for the 3 hr flight to Doha. Arrival was on-time and we were off into HIA’s Main Concourse. Transit was smooth. I did some shopping from QDF and had dinner from Burgerie (Food Court - South) HIA is normally busy in the early mornings due to most long-haul flights being scheduled around the same time (US/UK/EU/China/South Korea/AUS/NZ) But it didn’t cause any problems apart from extra waiting times at the Food court. As soon as I was done I came to see the “Final Call” 40 mins before departure for QR329 to London. Which meant I had to hurry up. As soon as I got to the Gate they called Zone 1 and I was first to board. I got comfortable in my seat. Pushback for this flight was on time. However the passenger next to me was quite disturbing in the flight. She persistently kept a sleeping angle which directly meant less space for me which was very uncomfortable on the night flight. I did not take any meals on this flight as I was full. Although I did hydrate myself regularly. After a couple of shows and a few hours of sleep we started descent into Gatwick and we landed at around 0630AM. De boarding was efficient and we were clear of all arrival procedures within 15 min and I was on my way on the 166 mile drive home. I won’t be using Gatwick again because of its location. And the disturbing passenger had no effect on the excellent hospitality of Qatar Airways. I hope to fly them soon again."

The choice of food is very limited and the menu revolves around south asian food. I believe the menu should be more diversified and neutral. passengers should not waste 10 mins of their time watching  advertisement after take-off and before each movie/series. The cabin was clean. The cabin crew was professional. The overall experience is not bad but far from the best in the World. "

In Toronto I was told that the boarding pass will be given in Montreal. When we arrived in Montreal there was no one to receive us at the gate and we were stopped at the gate that goes to the international boarding. After much discussing with security they opened the door to let us in to the departure check in counters. Qatar Airways staff were not aware that passengers from Toronto were stranded, but they check us in quickly and we went for boarding. The flight to Doha service was terrible, the food was very poor and we were served the second meal 8hrs after our first meal, with no snack between. The next flight to Goa was the same type of service. On the return flight though from Goa to Montreal was much better. service was better."

In both occasions we purchased pre paid seats. We have a specific place where we sit on the plane. Both cases we purchase business class seats. When we checked-in, in Johannesburg OR Thambo we were informed that our purchased seats were no longer available. This happened on both our flights, for Istanbul and Bangkok. We informed Qatar Airways about our disappointment and find it unacceptable to pay for seats and don't get. They said that they would refund us for the seats that we did not receive. We informed them in May, when we were back in the country. It has been 6 months now and still haven't received our refund. I tried several times calling Doha headquarters, but no one can help me. They keep saying I should contact Customer Support. Then I got a reply in 28 August 2022 and said that I should re-do the online account application, which I did the same day. I informed Customer Care that I did the application again, but since the I haven't received anything from Qatar Customer Care Service. I called Qatar Headquarters again in Doha, but yet again they can't help me. Just said I should send an email to tell us at Qatar Airways. For a 5 Star Airline they have the worst Customer Service. They are fast to sell you their product but they have no after service. They trick you to pay for seats, but in the end you do not get it."

Boarding process was also very smooth. Even though Heathrow's facilities do not facilitate a smooth boarding process. The flight took off on time, Seats were very comfortable and massive amounts of legroom. The IFE's screens were responsive and easy to use - Meals were a lot better thanks to the new Qcuisine services (I flew Emirates the week before and it was a lot worse). Landed in Doha on-time where I took the opportunity of grabbing myself a dinner and shopping from Qatar Duty Free, (10% off for QTR customers) - The flight to Islamabad was also boarded on time, not as smooth but that is more to be blamed on fellow passengers who do not listen to instructions or even try following them. The flight was quite short. About 2 hours on a new 777. I was sleeping most of the time. Upon arrival in Pakistan the Ground Staff were also quite helpful (Not Pakistani, the Qatari staff) assisting to all passenger concerns in baggage claim. I will be flying Qatar again next week to Gatwick via Doha - Qatar has always been excellent in the 50+ flights I have taken with them. Never fail to impress me. Thanks to Qatar Airways.

Our aircraft was a 12 year old 777-200LR these planes were meant to serve the DOH to AKL route which I flew on back in 2017 and the proposed Doha to Santiago de Chile route which never materialized, the plane was recently refurbished with QSuites but the WI-FI was very very patchy, The cabin crew tried their best but the plane was very full and were under a lot of stress. The snacks they offered were comparable to a less than two hour flight on a a domestic US route, a bar of chocolate or a pack of chips, the catering is deteriorating."

Check-In smooth. Lounge in Bangkok downgraded to become the 3rd party Miracle Lounge, which at a first glance appear nice but de facto is fairly useless and sterile. No bar, no soft chairs, outdoor area closed off, food is lousy, no music, no wines, no personal service nor attention. Boarding smooth and from jetbridge. Onboard, got an excellent, priority seat on upper deck which rendered a premium feeling. Got a lot of attention from FAs who recognised my gold-card status, treated me with respect, pleasure, provided options and recommendations on food and drinks, and went beyond their mandate to please me. I brought own wine-glasses to avoid drinking from plastic mugs – this is the faith of travelling economy. Wines and food was good. Its much better to depart early evenings more than after midnight as you are served proper dinner. Good IFE. Annoying safety video with Barcelona footballers has now gone on for 5 years without being replenished. Eternal charity calls on Educate a Child is inappropriate. Departure delayed 1 hour due to heavy downpour in Bangkok, causing ½ hour late arrival, which is acceptable. Luggage well-handled and arrived to final destination with their partner airline, Rwandair, without any issues. Lounge in Doha, Silverlounge, was acceptable, due to attentive staff and tarmac view.

Prices were reasonable and we were glad that none of our flights were subject to unreasonable delays and all of them arrived on time. I found  Doha Airport incredibly crowded.

They always made my travel very comfortable. Look forward to taking another Qatar flight real soon. Good luck to them and their staff!"

The surprise was so big, both for me and for my husband, because I sent an improvised mini cake and two prosecco glasses."

Overall I had two very good long-haul flights with Qatar Airways. On both flights, the seats were comfortable, esp. they had enough leg space for me (175 cm tall), and both had a power socket available just below the seat. I reclined on the second flight only, and it felt like a standard, good recline angle to me. The service started a bit late on both flights well past an hour of flight. The food was rather mediocre this time, but I appreciated real cutlery and a good selection of drinks. Boarding and disembarking weren't that great because both times (actually four times) it was done with a rather crowded bus. On the second flight boarding early meant spending more time in a hot bus waiting for the remaining passengers to arrive. I haven't used an entertainment system, but I was impressed with the screen size and quality on the first flight. Sadly WiFi was available only on the second flight when I didn't really need it. I tried it because one hour of complimentary free access was advertised, but it didn't work for me. I could barely log in and after I still had no actual internet connectivity. This time I discovered that the Qatar app allows you to track the luggage, which given all the mess happening right now with lost luggage around the world was quite comforting to see that the luggage was actually loaded onto the plane. Sadly, the app is a bit quirky to use as the luggage tracking is not available straight from the booking and requires providing a booking number. Also on the second flight, my booking was not visible at all. It just disappeared."

The crew for the leg from Doha to Dallas was underwhelming.  I did not get the cabin attendants name but she was inattentive and rude. I called for her via the light and each time I waited over 45 minutes and still had to get up w/ a 2 year old and go find her to get milk for him. The other guy working our side of the plane was the same. He walked by me multiple times while I had the call light on and did not acknowledge me. I do want to shout out a Qatar employee (I wish I got her name) but she was by the baggage claim in Dallas and she was so helpful. I was traveling by myself with a 2 year old and she helped to get my luggage and roll it to the re check bag area. I am so grateful for her. Also another attendant on my Nairobi to Doha leg, he was so helpful. Helped me with me bags and even had an airport attendant carry my bags and get me a ride to security.

The family that was expecting a quad had more problems as one of the kids didn’t like sitting apart from the parents, which is one of the benefits of the product. Flight was really good with service by Gabriel first rate. Dine on demand is really good however as the flight lands at 9:30 in the morning a breakfast option would have been good instead of all being based around dinner.

Fabulous service and offerings. Thoughtful and lovely crew. The issue was partly not the blame of Qatar. Checking in at Barajas I had all the correct paperwork including the PCR test done the day before. They decided they didn’t like the document and that I had to have a last minute pcr at the airport. Luckily all ok but the result wasn’t enough and had to email it and it had to be read on a computer before I could board. All papers checked again at Doha resulting in flight being 2 hours delayed. I think it’s the Hong Kong arrivals that pushed It. On the flight extremely impressed. They switch aircraft type a lot which worked on my favour. I like the backward facing seat actually.

The planes are not as modern and spacious as the A50s which used to be on this route. The planes are modern and clean with excellent inflight entertainment, professional staff and reasonable food. The inflight magazines, the fresheners and menus have disappeared due to the pandemic. But the food portions, although smaller, are reasonably tasty and the staff still keep the lavatories clean with good overall service.

This was a personal trip. While I have been to US several times over last 17 years - for business as well as personal trips, it was a first trip to US for my son. My son will be pursuing MS at USC in LA and hence he needed extra luggage allowance. My past experience with Qatar is the primary reason I booked our flights with Qatar, though it was not the cheapest option. I wanted to make sure that, even if I had to cancel my travel plan at last minute, my son will have hurdle free journey. However, I was happy that I chose Qatar Airways. Every stage - flight booking, seat & meal selection, check-in, in-flight exp, meals & snacks, in-flight entertainment, baggage handling - was a pleasant experience. Qatar provided extra luggage allowance as student allowance to my son. Qatar also provided full-flight complimentary wi-fi to him as a student offer. We are vegetarians. Almost all airlines have vegetarian meal option but a handful provide good quality and tasty veg meals. Qatar veg meal was excellent. So was their choice of snacks and beverages. Staff was polite and friendly though we were in Economy. I have noticed a stark difference in airline staff behavior when they deal with Business versus Economy class passengers. Even in Economy, their staff was cordial and caring. There were several passengers with variety of queries ranging from meal options to why satellite-based wi-fi was not working at certain times. Staff was answering and helping passengers with genuine interest. A couple of suggestions : 1) Qatar should consider waiving off seat selection fees for middle seats. I had to pay for it as I wanted to make sure I travel together with my son 2) I am not sure if Qatar provides confirmation notification about successful luggage transfer in connecting flights. If they don't then they must consider providing this notification as it will serve as a huge relief for the passengers that their luggage is not left behind. Some other airlines do provide such notifications either via their app or SMS."

The outbound flight crew were awful and the cabin service was poor, the crew appeared tired and 'hassled' and were not at all friendly. They did not appear to be fully trained as the usual and past cabin crew have always been, the food was really poor and tasteless. We took advantage of an upgrade offer (QR3900) for our return journey to Doha hoping to enjoy a better quality service upon our return. It proved to be anything but. Firstly the Business Class Lounge catering to Qatar Airways Business Class passengers was closed? We went to other lounges but they were full and would not accept us, eventually we found a lounge that did offer us seats in their reception area. The snack food was truly below par, so too was the extremely poor selection of beverages. We boarded on time and the crew were definitely better and friendlier than our outbound flight, the menu appeared OK but when the food was served it was not up to the Airlines usual standard. I had only a mouthful and could not eat the rest, the chicken that was served to my wife was overcooked and extremely tough. So from a clear '10' that we would rate on all of our previous flights with Qatar Airways our rating on this recent experience would be 4/10."

Initially, BA worked with us on the checkin which was great but the Qatar Airways staff at the Boarding Gate and check-in at Heathrow (London to Doha) were most exceptional. They understood the situation (the booking was mistakenly done in my wife's maiden name which not her current passport)- although we also her maiden name passport when traveling as it has her visa in it. The pressure and stress of traveling was taken away in an instance and we ended up having the rest of our journey stress free. In addition, the Qatar Airways staff at the Doha Airport smoothed our journey even more. On both legs of our Qatar Airways flights our 2 young children were taken care of immediately upon boarding the plane."

Finally boarded the flight and sat there for more than an hour before being told there were issues with the plane. Later deplaned and told another plane was being prepared. As we were trying to leave, we got told to go back to our seats and that they might have fixed the issue. More time has passed and we were finally told it was going to take off. By the time we had left Heathrow, it was delayed 5 hours. This meant I had missed my connecting flight to Sydney. On the plane, the entertainment system at my seat didn't work. The touch screen failed and I had to move to the adjacent seat that was empty and use that screen. Food was okay, inflight service was good. Upon landing in Doha had my boarding pass taken from me and given a new one. I was not given any sort of compensation to use a lounge, got told to speak with the transfer desk. The flight from Doha to Perth which I was being redirected to was delayed by 2+ hours. When I got to Perth, to my shock horror, I was put on Jetstar Airways instead of a partner plane like Qantas. The Jetstar plane was also delayed by 2hrs. I was supposed to arrive in Sydney at 6pm on a Friday, I arrived instead at 8am on Saturday. I was only offered statutory compensation after I have still yet to receive. I not received a refund on the upgraded seats I paid for but was not able to use because of the delays. "

I checked again with transit desk, none of them bother to look at my email but rather just telling me “sorry but all the extra legged seats are all reserved” Not to mentioned the supervisor kept saying “reserved is reserved”. That’s why I was trying to show the email to the staffs but they don’t care. I believe the confirmation email I received is valid to prove the seat is reserved for me. In this case, obviously it’s double-booked However, none of the we staff  managed to solve my issue. "

There were two suitcases. Qatar provided next flight, but with delay 20 hours which I spent in airport without any complaining and compensation. During my awaiting time they found just one of my suitcases and told me to fill application about lost luggage in final destination for second one and promised that it will be delivered during 2-3 days Any worries from my side I get used to trust people especially company with so high renting. I filled application for lost luggage after my arriving to Goa, but they didn't provide PIR code. More then 2 weeks they found nothing. "

New planes, comfortable seats, good leg room (for a 6 foot tall person), entertainment system and screen excellent, and the food tasty and at the right portion size. Cabin was fabulous lit with light purples and blues. Crew were efficient and courteous. Took off on time arrived early at both Hamad International and Edinburgh. Having done various routes from SIN to EDI over the 17 years, must say this was best flight. "

The flight from Paris had almost one and half hour delay for which we had no clear explanation. With this delay, I arrived at the boarding for the Doha-Tehran flight 10 minutes before departure time, but staff did not let us board and gave us a ticket for 7 hours later. So we have to wait more than 7 hours in Doha so we can take our second flight. No apology or compensation was offered (apart from a free meal) and the only thing we can do is to send emails to Qatar Airways and go through a probably long and tiring path to register our complaint.

A350-1000 is one of the most modern planes in operation. The seats were very comfortable despite their thin appearance. There was no tailbone pain during the 15 hour trip from SFO to DOH. There was enough leg room in the first row after business class - Row 16. The best seats on this plane are 31A and 31K as there are no seats in front of them and you get a window too. The next best seats are 17C and 17H, those are aisle seats with no seats in front. Qatar' economy food was pretty good and sufficient. The AVML choices are offered in the standard menu so no need to order special meals. The quality of food was surprisingly good in all segments. Not too oily, spicy. Doha airport gets too crowded in the central area, which is the only downside in the whole trip. The service onboard was pretty good with the crew being quite responsive to your needs. Will not hesitate to fly Qatar again in future."

The resulted in an extremely long layover of 17 hrs 45 mins instead of a planned and bearable 7 hrs 25 mins. It was during the course of downloading the QR App that we noted that the flight timing differs from the timing originally booked. We called Customer Service Hotline immediately to understand the situation and our options. However, we were only told to contact Qatar Airways Customer Care via portal/email. We lodged our concerns to seek alternative arrangements and or suitable recovery efforts at Doha Airport. To-date we have not heard from QR office despite 2 email reminders. Upon landing at Doha Airport, we approached Qatar Airways Transit Desk to listen to what recovery arrangements have been made for affected passengers. We requested for a ‘Flight disruption letter’ to facilitate any possible travel insurance claim. The Manager told us that no flight disruption letter will be issued from Doha as the flight disruption had taken place outbound from Singapore. However, this was inconsistent with what passengers were told when the same request was made at the QR check-in counter in Singapore ie. to be provided at DOHA. In relation to our request for accommodation / lounge access, the Manager explained that due to COVID reasons, no accommodation nor lounge access could be arranged for affected passengers. Giving the benefit of the doubt to Qatar Airways, the least one would expect is for the airline to mitigate the inconvenience caused through other measures. Instead, other than meal vouchers, none was forthcoming. We also note that some affected passengers were able to have lounge access or sleep pods at their own expense."

Qatar changed my flight several times and now I am flying Dubai-Doha-Montreal-Chicago, not in Q-Suite. The annoying part was, that my ticket requested me to pay for my seat assignment. Of course I expected Qatar airways that if they change my flight, they also change my seat to the new route/plane for the fee, which I had paid for the original itinerary. With every change Qatar made, I had to call customer service, explain my entire problem and have endless discussions about why I do not pay again for a new seat assignment, if Qatar is the one to change my flights. It was nerve wrecking, time consuming and straightforward unpleasant and annoying. As nice as their Qsuite may be, the changes are horrible. And even though I am already on my way to Platinum status, this was my last booking with them, as I am fed up with an unreliable company. "

The lounges at Melbourne were great, food was good and very friendly staff. After a relaxing wait I went to board and I was lucky and fortunate enough to be upgraded to business class (much to my shock and surprise) I was speechless. Once I had boarded the plane I was amazed at my surroundings, I’ve never experienced anything like this. The Air hostess was so good, friendly and really made my experience extremely pleasant. Everything about this leg of the flight was perfect - I slept in absolute comfort, the seats reclined so I could lay down, the service was incredible, the menu had a variety of choices and the entertainment was excellent. Quite simply, Qatar airways have a customer for life and they are the best airline I have ever used, I cannot recommend highly enough. Thank you so much Qatar Airways for making my journey one of the best experiences I’ve ever had in my life and I’m still smiling today."

It was disappointing that Qatar seems not to re-open its flagship lounge at BKK airport after more than 2 years of closure. Does not make sense to use a very mediocre Miracle lounge since number of flights are back to pre Covid, and airfares about 40% higher in comparison to pre Covid times. Flight was uneventful, food was nothing to shout about. Champagne was uncoiled, red wine was ice cold. I was glad that my flight from Doha was from B2 gate and not the usual bus station like E area. I could not be more wrong. They used an empty airbridge gate and used buses from there. The worst part was to sit in an very hot aircraft with an open door on the tarmac with a very weak aircondition. Generally, Doha Airport has lost its advantage over other airports and is the weakest part of the overall experience while flying Qatar. The flight to Warsaw was good, with better service and food in comparison to my first leg of the journey. There are no more amenity kits for Doha to Europe flights. When I asked about it, I was told that there are no more kits for flights below 6h. Both of my flights were 5.5h; but the BKK to Doha sector had a lovely amenity kit. Overall ok flights, but Qatar lacks consistency, and the ground services in Doha are getting worse. I was lucky enough to have good seats on this trip; not Qsuites, but not the dreaded 2-2-2 configuration."

The food is good compared to other gulf carriers, I'm amazed that even in economy class they provide some options for the passengers. Free alcohol is provided during the flight. the entertainment system is also okay. the only critics is the seat in this type of aircraft is somehow really tight for a a long flight, when there's IFE box underneath the seat it makes your space for legs even tighter.

Another disappointment occurred when they tried to cancel my wife's business class ticket without notification. When I called, I was lied to and told that the flight had been cancelled due to operational issues, but when I asked them how come our coach tickets on the same flight were not cancelled, they could not explain. They cancelled and re-booked my wife's ticket in excess of 6 times requiring me to spend hours upon hours on the phone with their Customer Service Center in Doha. This went on and on for 5 days until I was finally able to rescue my wife's original itinerary for the alleged flight that had been cancelled (QR 726) but was now somehow reinstated.  And even when they tried to make amends and promised lounge club passes for my family upon arrival in Doha, upon arrival there were no club passes nor any entries in the PNR record locator.

I was given pyjamas to use on the flight, they were comfortable. The A380 has a very impressive lounge with very few people using it at the time I went which meant that the air stewardess who was on duty could take time to chat. The service was supremely good, dining was à la carte, so you could order what you want when you want it, presentation of the food was very nice indeed, the actual quality of the food was the only thing that let them down."

Check-in in CPH quick and pleasant, done within Minutes, which gave me almost 4 hours in lounges as the many counters opens 4 hours prior to departure. I was given plenty of seat options as flights were full/about to be full. The Eventyr Lounge that they use is nice and improving, the view is gorgeous. Smooth boardings and deboardings, all on jet-bridges. I oppose the by far too early gate calls, 80 Minutes before departure in CPH, despite gate is only 3 Minutes away from lounge. Lounge in DOH has changed to the new Silver Lounge at B-gates. Its roomy and nice though 1-2 steps below the level of the Al Mourjan lounge – on the other hand it provides tarmac views as the only of its kind in Doha. Onboard, a breeze of service, FA attention, and recognition of status level. 3 hot meals offered from CPH, I tried 2 of them, they were quite good. Drinks rounds and offerings were plenty, incl sparkling wine on both flights. Last flight there were 2 hot breakfast option, I craved for a 3rd option and they managed to deliver it to perfection after only 20 Minutes additional waiting. Impressive on a full flight. Managed to sleep 3 hours on the last flight in an exit row seat with meters ahead of me for leg stretching. IFE was top notch with 150+ movies, the best I have had on any economy flight.

The train from ZYA to BRU was part of the travel itinerary, where the train arrived later than expected. Qatar Airways check-in desk re-opened again and allowed me to proceed with the process. The horrifying passport controls with a very long queue were the main challenge. The flight was supposed to depart at 4:35 pm, and I only managed to went through the immigration at 4:28 pm. Qatar Airways personnel was waiting for me, and my 250 meters dash began with assistance from the ground team in Brussels airport. I made it to the gate and aircraft at 4:33 pm and the flight departed on time. Kudos to the ground team in Brussel and the Customer Service assistance."

The Boeing 777-300 has a 3-4-3 layout in economy and it was full.  Qatar have a mask policy - however this mask policy was not implemented or enforced. It was mentioned once but staff did not remind passengers they should wear masks. As a result many passengers did not wear masks at all. In Doha the plane had to be reached via a bus.  On the first flight the crew was not very friendly. Food was delicious. "

I have taken 5 round trips in the last ten months. I fly out of Atlanta. The first two times they used A350-900 non-Qsuite aircraft, both trips were great. From in-flight service to food, everything was top-notch. Then from my 3rd trip and on, they used the older 777 300ERs, they do not have the same seats, and the entertainment system and the screens are very slow to respond. The worst part is when you try to lay down; your feet are always dangling and not even with your body. It feels more like a long recliner than a lie-flat seat.  They offer newer 777s and some even with Q suites on shorter routes, I enjoyed when I flew from Doha to Istanbul or to Dhaka. Why not use these newer aircraft for the long haul flights such as Atlanta to Doha or Doha to Atlanta, where people really need their rest, considering these are 14-hour flights. Their catering service from Atlanta has gone down drastically in the past few months. "

Francis Harrigan",,9th June 2022,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Doha to Phuket,April 2022,,,,,1.0,,3,yes,8,"  Booked a flight for my wife in Feb 2020 with QR using my Avios points. Then in April 2020, QR canceled the flight. When I attempted to rebook in April 2022, I am advised that my Avios points have been forfeited (208,000). Customer Service do not reply for 5 weeks and then refer me to the Privilege Club (of which I have been a member for 15 years). The Privilege Club refer me to the QR COVID policy on cancellation and then back to Customer Service. Whether a policy written by QR after the purchase of the ticket actually entitles QR to cancel my points is in my view moot. QR canceled the booking, then forfeited my points and gave me no notice of pending forfeiture (in Feb 2022). They restricted me to a two year window to rebook in circumstances where rebooking was infeasible due to COVID related travel restrictions. My point is why give a loyal customer the run around? It would cost virtually nothing in financial terms to restore the forfeited points and would retain my loyalty.  The is a critical review of Customer Service for an airline that in most other ways is excellent."

When waiting to board the flight there was no priority lane for business class passengers. Once I had boarded, I would have appreciated a better welcome and more information regarding the services on board. Unfortunately I was mostly ignored by staff when I got into my seat except when I had the do not disturb sign on. I was awakened as the air steward who he needed to know my meal preference. It was a 14 hour flight. I do not understand the urgency from the staff. It defeats the purpose of even having a do not disturb sign.  I was not offered any bedding on the flight. "

Normally when I fly with my wife we ​​have a double Q suite (3E/3F) Now I had 1A. Flying in Qatar's Q suite is considered the best option to fly in Business class. When you then add the service level that the Cabin staff provides, I have a hard time finding anything to complain about. To be able to decide for yourself when you want to eat, I also find absolutely perfect on longer flights. All people are different I want to eat as early in the trip as possible while my wife wants to get her meal later. The section Doha - Stockholm was a more common type of seat configuration 1-2-1 The same nice cabin staff. Have flown a lot during my professional life (am now retired), have not found in recent years any airline that provides such a good flight (travel) experience as a whole as Qatar. They may not be the cheapest option but clearly an option not to be underestimated. Qatar Airways has always lined up if we have had any problems with my travel (both private and business travel). Already planning for our next trip and Qatar is definitely our main option for this trip as well."

But I’ve noticed that Qatar is unable to keep its quality edge over its competitors. It started at BKK airport where they use an inferior contract Lounge since they closed their own lounge indefinitely. The food on board was very mediocre to say the least. There is no more butter for the bread and the main courses were underwhelming in terms of quality and quantity. The beer I had was served at room temperature. The transfer in Doha was the usual chaos at the basement level. The staff wasn’t very friendly and the bus arrived at the aircraft while the aircraft was still being cleaned. We had to wait in a bus  for 30 min before being allowed to board. This wasn’t the first time I’ve experienced this communication chaos using the bus. All in all, I am not willing to pay a premium for flying Qatar anymore. The decline in service, the last minute changes in type of aircraft does not justify the fares it is charging, which is, especially in Premium well above pre Covid times. "

I still queried how my baggage was going to be rushed to meet the connecting flight and was told it was being taken care of. I arrived this morning in London Gatwick to no suitcase.  I am on my knees praying my bag is found. There were several other people also with missing luggage. Very upsetting."

Inflight entertainment was not as good as previous system. Food was delicious and healthy. Cabin crew were very professional and attentive. Good product but the Q-Suite seems a little cramped. The lay-flat bed was comfortable but for taller people your feet are touching the inside when fully flat. Q-Suite provided privacy and comfort. Double bed configuration was great for family flying. They have removed aircraft cameras from the in-flight entertainment.

N Belgrove",A380,20th April 2022,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to Doha,April 2022,4.0,3.0,1.0,,1.0,,3,no,2,"  We chose to fly with Qatar Airways to the Maldives with our two young sons (5 and 8 years old). When we arrived at Heathrow we were informed our flight had only just departed Doha due to technical difficulties, which meant a 7 hour delay at the airport with 2 young children. We were offered a £40 voucher for the whole family for food and refreshments. We effectively lost a day of our holiday. When we booked our tickets, we ensured we selected flights which had a brief (< 2 hour) stopover in Doha and we paid a premium compared to options with a far longer stopover. Shortly before our holiday we received a notification of a change of flights which meant we now had a 6 hour stopover in Doha for the return journey - something we had wanted to avoid with our 2 young children. I contacted Qatar by telephone (no easy task) to request an alternative flight but this was not possible and no explanation was given for the change. On arrival in Doha, the Qatar Airways transfer staff were unhelpful and not interested in providing us with any lounge access to allow our children to rest (we were in Doha airport from 10pm to 4am local time). We tried numerous lounges at Hamad International Aiport and were willing to pay for access but nobody was able to help us.  We tried to reserve premium seats on some of the flights via the Qatar app, but each time we were unable to complete the additional payment. I contacted Qatar by telephone to reserve our seats but was told I was not able to do this because I booked through an agent (Expedia). I contacted Expedia and was told I needed to contact the airline to reserve ‘preferred’ seats. I contacted Qatar once more and spoke to a different associate who advised me that I could indeed reserve these seats after all. This whole process was convoluted and time consuming and a demonstration of the poor customer interface and lack of staff training. This was our first experience with Qatar Airways and will be our last. "

I booked a Qsuite, but there was a change in aircraft type, and I ended up with a rather mediocre type of seat. My flight from Warsaw to Doha was ok in terms of food, but the service was not what I was used to. The inflight manager did not greet me as a business class passenger and Platinum member. There was no candle and no salt and pepper dispenser for my lunch. Also, no amenity kit for Warsaw to Doha flights. The Doha to Bangkok flight was better, with a caring inflight supervisor and better service. Unfortunately, I booked a seat close to the galley. The crew was rather lively throughout the night, which kept me awake. Considering that Qatar airfares are already well beyond pre-Covid times, and the fact that cost cutting measures are still in place (e.g. the apparently permanent closure of the lovely flagship lounge at BKK airport), makes me think twice before I book Qatar again."

The agent didn't inform me that they're going to re-book the second fright from Doha to Chicago to later time, making my layover 20 hours instead of 2:45. The agent at the boarding gate at Cairo assured us that we'll get accommodation taken care of once we arrive in Doha. In Doha, the customer service in the Transfer area was far from professional. They kept us waiting for 2-3 hours in the transfer area, and refused giving us any rooms claiming that Egypt is red listed due to COVID.  They refused to give us access to lounges to get some rest before our 15 hour flight. They said they're not responsible for what the agents said in Cairo, and they didn't witness the conversation.  3 meal vouchers were added to the boarding pass, two of them worth 30QR, and the third worth 60QR.

This was my return portion of my trip so my flight was a BA flight number and I truly enjoyed the A380 experience. Even though the product was dated as it is the only aircraft type that Qatar Airways has first class on, but even business class is the old product but it doesn’t mean it is not good - it is better than most of the competition. The Wi-Fi was very slow and I did not use the entertainment system. The food was the best tasting and presentation I have ever had on any flight I have taken since I started flying in the early 1970s especially the scallops and ossobuco. The Caviar was more on the cheaper Sevruga type and the strawberry pie was masked with too much sugar to give your taste buds a chance to see it’s quality but to put an item on the menu as “Qatari grown chicken“ does not do any positive advertising for the country because it does not show these chicken are free range or organic fed or even antibiotic free - that issue has to be addressed sooner rather than later. The cabin staff were excellent."

I wanted to take the opportunity to fly one the A380 as the were slowly taking to the skies. The first class on the Qatar Airways A380 is dated but very spacious and the washrooms are huge, the entertainment system was tripping throughout the flight, the cabin crew were very friendly.

Yet having changed the first outward plane from the original booking 4 months earlier, my seat was changed from 2K to 10K. Although QR had my phone and email, at no time did the airline attempt to contact me. At the airport I refused to sit in the second cabin. It was only thanks to a member of the ground staff who persuaded someone in 3K to change with me. The lounge at BKK was not the Qatar Airways lounge but the miserable Miracle lounge. The flights themselves were vastly better with one exception. The seats are extremely comfortable and sleeping is relatively easy. The 777 and A350 had the Q suites. I enjoy these on the 777 but the cabin feels quite cramped on the A350. Meals were excellent but the movie selection was boring and seemed geared more to children. The one exception was departing EDI. With the cabin crew arriving late, we had to stand in line for about 25 minutes before boarding started. The three wheelchair passengers were naturally allowed priority. A few minutes later business class was boarded but with the wheelchairs  still at the end of the airbridge we had to wait another 20 minutes or so before they could be boarded. I looked forward to a hot towel and a glass of rose champagne. Quickly other passengers were being served while no FA bothered to take my coat. I finally had to ask to be served, being the last in the cabin to receive any attention. This was another disgrace as with glasses being quickly collected as the aircraft having started to taxi to the runway, I managed only three mouthfuls. I have taken QR several times on this route and used to enjoy it. Business class on all flights was full but that is no excuse for the problems."

Almost all my Qsuite bookings over the last few years changed due to aircraft change to inferior business class seats.  On the ground in Doha all 4 flights used buses to and from the aircraft. It is not a big deal for arriving in Doha, but the departure area for remote aircraft is like always crowded, often no seats, shouting and screaming of gate staff, since no loudspeaker announcements.  I noticed this time a decline in onboard services, I requested not to eat, just to keep my glass of water full. This did not happen. On the 5hr flight from Doha to Warsaw, there was no set of earplugs in the kit, just socks and eyeshades. Catering was as usual very good, and they finally got rid of that bad safety video, which I had to endure for so many years. As a longtime Qatar Diamond to tier member, I have been a huge fan of the carrier, but I am concerned about the declining standards."

While initially impressive, of two minds. Foot well narrow for a taller person. As suspected, a little awkward if you cannot fully fill up the space (we were an adult family group of ""3""). On super long run DOH-IAD, middle aged man placed his elderly father in last seat of Quad then took the window seat nearby and closed the door and went to sleep. Dad became a tad agitated during the night, banging the walls and slamming the retractable ""wall"" up and down. I took care of my elderly parents so I understand. As cordial as we were, he was probably unnerved by the ""strangers"" around him. After checking on him, immediately notified an attendant and purser to wake the son so they could change seats. Eventually settled down but not particularly restful. Catering hit or miss (but premium wine cellar). Qatari farmed chicken ""leg"" (didn't specify that on booking menu) main truly disgusting full of bones and gristle. Turkish Airlines Business catering superior and consistently good. Flight attendants genuinely lovely and warm and enjoyed conversing with them though a few perfunctory and one of us always inadvertently got skipped for breakfast. They always tried to make up for it by preparing a nice plate from what was available but thought the service would be more polished. Would consider flying again if the price were competitive but all agreed, a tad overrated and and underwhelming experience (especially since they are constantly touting all the awards and accolades).

Flights on time. Ticket purchase, upgrade by miles (2nd leg), ground services, ticket changes went smooth. I had to change a simple economy ticket 4 times. Only once I was charged additional (minimal charge). Check-in in CPH easy and quick getting all 3 boarding passes at once. This, despite I faced steep documentation requirements for final destination beyond Singapore to Papua New Guinea. Their cooperation with partner Air Niugini was perfectly coordinated and a relief. QR respect their elite members on ground as well as on board – for this trip there were no let-downs or real issues – their call centre was excellent, decisional, and cooperative. Lounge experiences: QR uses now the Eventyr Lounge in CPH which is a great improvement compared to the lounges they earlier used. Further, it is situated in non-Schengen area 3 Minutes from boarding gate. The Eventyr lounge is good, likely the best in Copenhagen - but it is still below world class. The best is the views, service, showers, and draught beer presence. Hot food only provides 1 dish while cold sandwiches are more diverse. No champagne and poor wines. They should open the balcony area to reduce greenhouse heating effect of the panorama windows which dominates the entire lounge. In Doha, the Al Mourjan Lounge is back to previous (pre-Corona) standards – lack of beer options are the biggest shortcoming. Good showers and very good relax/working options. CPH-DOH: I was given an exit seat but opted to take the only full seat section available next to the toilets so I could spread out with my things. Free WiFi for 1 hour granted, it worked well. Stewardess(es) were of high quality. Food good and are improving compared to just a few months ago. Sparkling wine (cava) offered in economy. The 2 wines were good. The new beers to replace the Heineken do not really provide improvements as they are also very dull, industrial lagers (Budwiser and Stella Artois). Arrived in Doha well pampered and in a splendid mood. DOH-SIN (night-flight) in business: Embarking in Doha at a remote gate by busses is a bad first impression for a business class ride. The Q-suites in business class are in my view completely overrated. These micro-cabins deprive passengers contact, air and view. Window access poor from those seats forward directed. If one sits backwards oriented, the window access is perfect but the direction is awkward to me. Seats and beds were excellent. The IFE is world class with updated movies, huge selection options, and the best I have ever encountered. Huge soft touch monitors. Smooth travel, reliable airline, flights on time. FAs excellent, 2 kinds: well-trained caretakers and less trained food-bringers. High class dining though without true dinner. The food was good but just “light, cold dinner snacks”. Cold lobster bites dont quite make it. Breakfast better, but merely neatly looking and served than actually tasty. Coffee and tea truly homemade and of high class. Drinks were World-class: 2 champagnes and 6 wines offered – all expensive and of high quality. Bollinger 2006 rose champagne was very tasty and sparkling one of the best I have had for long. One quality beer, Leffe Blonde, was outstanding. Pyjamas and Amenity kit given out."

G Berten",,28th February 2022,Solo Leisure,Business Class,New York to Cairo via Doha,February 2022,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,,2,no,2,"  I flew business class from JFK to Doha and first class on to Cairo, Egypt and the cabin service was excellent on both legs.  Upon my arrival in Cairo I found out that my luggage did not arrive with me. After taking quite a bit of time to file the lost luggage paperwork, I was informed that I would have to return to the airport (one hour taxi ride each way) to pick it up myself. Luckily, the suitcase arrived the next day and I had built in an extra day for sightseeing prior to the start of my tour. It took $100 and 5 hours round trip to retrieve my suitcase. I saved the receipts and submitted them to Qatar for reimbursement - and they will not reimburse me because I didn't buy anything. Apparently if I had bought clothing when I was dead tired after close to 24 hours of travel, they might have reimbursed me.  But they didn't tell me this up front. They let me go through the entire process a few times before deciding not to reimburse me. So despite paying for a first class ticket, I had to lose a sightseeing day."

Around 17:30 after Zone 1 was boarded, we see everyone coming back to the terminal. No one told us why, we were asked to take our seats in the terminal again. After approximately 30 minutes we are asked to go to boarding again. After boarding was complete, the pilot made an announcement telling us that he cannot start engine number 2 and that technicians were on the way. He then proceeded to ask us to get off the plane because they needed to completely shut down and reboot the plane and that it would be very uncomfortable for us to be inside the aircraft when that was taking place. He also mentioned that it would be a lot more comfortable for us in the terminal as we would have refreshments and be able to use the facilities. And so we offboarded and onto the terminal.  In the upcoming 4 hours we waited without any information, no update given to us, no one from Qatar was at the gates or in any way present. There was an announcement saying that we will get an update in 30 minutes but that update never came. We asked the airport staff several times and we were told that the staff is on the plane fixing it and that we will get an update. No update came. There was only one shop that only accepted cash for payment.  No update about our flight or the connecting flight that we had missed (QR 0161) or about what to do next. We were ignored and the situation was mishandled. No person from QA or airport staff asked us if we needed anything or offered a glass of water or any piece of information.  We understand and prefer to be offboarded from a faulty aircraft for our own safety, but they were not capable to offer water for 6 hours. "

My experience was at best average, and a disappointment after having such high expectations. I purchased extra legroom in the emergency exit row. When I reached my seat during boarding there was the pillow, blanket, amenity kit, and headphones on my seat. I set them down next to my seat on the floor, as there was no where else where I could have access to them while seated. For take off procedures the flight attendant grabbed all of the items and put them into the overhead storage bin away from my seat. When I was able to get up, I could not even locate all of the items. My food was average at best and staff took so long to collect the used meal trays that passengers were bringing their trays to the staff workstation. My one beef with the entertainment system was that they played the same airline/airport commercial every time you watched a new show. When time my flight arrived in Doha we had to exit using stairs and board a shuttle to reach the terminal. And with all of the other COVID rules on masks and cleaning, why would you pack in passengers on a shuttle bus until it is very full. I sent a fairly comprehensive email to Qatar Airways that highlighted my disappointment, received an automated reply from the airline nearly two weeks ago acknowledging receipt of my email but I have heard nothing back since. Perhaps it is the highly rated business class product that is generating the rave reviews. But as for us coach passengers, I don’t understand how this airline could be number one. "

On board, the staff were all smartly-dressed and carried out their duties in a calm, professional manner. Their service was attentive and discreet, not overbearing and intrusive.

Food was really good, and excellent choices, when I had my nighttime nip of whiskey they gave me a large measure and made a special trip to see if I wanted another drink. The plane was fairly quiet so after take of the staff assisted all in spreading out and getting a row each to make it comfortable. I will only fly Qatar now out of Adelaide. I personally would like to thank Qatar Airways for continuing to support Australia even when our national carrier stopped all international flights, it was the only real option to fly out of Adelaide."

Catering and service top notch. The only negative point was the awful and childish safety video. Transfer in Doha uneventful. The nightmare started at the =bus gate, which is =chaotic and stressful. Not enough seats, overcrowded, no social distancing. The rude and clearly incompetent gate agent shouted at his staff and contributed to the already stressful atmosphere. Priority boarding is a joke at the bus gates, as priority guests are allowed to enter the plane last. The plane was an oldish A332 with the very old narrow business class seats. Due to the uncomfortable seat, no sleep for me. Service was disappointing. I asked for just a glass of water and no food after takeoff and had to ask again 2 hours later because they forgot about it. I really like to fly Qatar and I usually receive good service as a Platinum guest. But the inconsistency of seating comfort due to aircraft change and service onboard makes the trips rather unpredictable."

Air Canada's ridiculousness almost caused me to miss my connecting flight to Qatar, but the stress that could have caused me was completely alleviated by Qatar's staff assuring me that any cancellation prior to take off would receive a full refund directly to the method of payment. This generous policy during COVID times really made me very thankful and they deserve praise for it. That bumps up the review overall though, because the in air experience is not great. The on ground experience is perfect, with great boarding, great staff support, great call support, great privilege club benefits and so on. But in the air, I was greeted with an oldish plane and subpar seating. The seats were somehow smaller than even I've become accustomed to in recent years. The entertainment system was alright but slightly laggy, and the headphones provided were awful. The food was of acceptable quality, though the lunch provided between the two meals was subpar (it was a boring, bland roll.) The wifi is only 10 dollars but privilege club members get one hour for free. I believe students get it for free in general but I wasn't able to get that to work. The wifi was pretty great quality, easily able to support youtube streaming. Connectivity was good as long as you were over land and not water, obviously. Qatar could do quite a bit to improve their seating and entertainment. But in other customer service they were brilliant for this flight."

Tried changing my flight under Manage trips on Qatar's site but with the same result; various options are displayed on the calendar but I selected one, the page would indicate 'There are no flights matching your search.' I phoned Qatar's UK helpline more than 15 times over several days and downloaded the Rebtel app to call its Doha line. The UK line went dead after I selected the option to speak to customer service and I remained on hold for more than an hour when calling its overseas hotline. I reached out on Twitter multiple times and all I got was an automated response telling me to call the helpline when I'd already made it clear I'd tried numerous times before and failed to get through. I did not show up for my flight and have not heard from Qatar.  In this era of Covid where travel plans are subject to change due to a volatile situation, travellers need assurance that they can change their flights. "

Considering an international 3hr 20  mins flight, Qatar Airways should have provided a better aircraft than the A320. The flight was packed with less seating space and difficulty in managing the cabin baggage. I had pre-booked a vegetarian oriental meal, the cottage cheese was quite hard and amount of rice was bare minimum. "

R Heale",,4th December 2021,Business,Economy Class,Doha to London,December 2021,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,3,no,5,  Check in fine. Boarding awful with not enough seating. Early snack a dry egg sandwich but full bar service. IFE poor and hard to navigate. Not a spot on regional rivals. My breakfast meal was cold and soggy. But more drinks served. Cabin crew fine. Toilet was a wet mess throughout. Cabin very cold but nice blanket and pillow. Some good things but nothing special. Never had been in all my economy experiences with Qatar.

Even though the screen towards the Isle is nice my seat was so uncomfortable and rock hard and my feet squeezed in tight little wedge in front when you put your seat bed position. Asked when the would turn on the WiFi and the answer was ""it's a new aircraft so there is no WiFi"". It wasn't installed on a brand new aircraft. But as always the service is impeccable. Also miss the shoe box they forgot when they built the Q-suites!"

They right away informed me via app notification, email, and a phone call (following day business hour). It really put my mind at ease. They changed to an aircraft fitted with Q suite, which is like flying first class. Due to the delay, business class cabin was quite full, but it didn't affect the high level of service. Welcome drinks, pyjama sets, toiletry bag and all. Due to the pandemic, there was no magazines or any reading materials. However, there were printed menu and wine list. Crew wear a face mask. Food was served course by course in generous portion, there was no signs of any cost cutting. Inflight wifi was fast and steady too, only cost USD10 for the entire flight. Qsuite is one of the very best business class seats in the current market. The door gives you an excellent level of privacy. Comfortable large seat with sufficient storage space and comfortable for sleeping position. Throughout the flight crew presence is good, very pro active, they always come around and see if anyone needs a drink or so. A truly wonderful 9 hours just flew by, a very smooth landing. Plane was parked on tarmac, we had to be bussed to the gate. Biz customers get their own bus. Connecting in Doha is a bliss, with security procedures simplified. Fantastic huge Al Mourjan lounge with nice shower facilities and plenty to eat and get a rest. Next flight was on their new 787, fitted with new seats that also come with individual doors! Once again, meal was delicious and plenty, same excellent service all the way to Vienna. It really was one of the top best flight experiences I've ever had, especially after having stayed put for 18 months. It was a wonderful way to come back to traveling again."

We went to one line but where told they were not boarding yet even though we showed them our tickets. After standing around for 10 minutes we noticed several people going to a separate line and being allowed through, turn out this was the line for business class. Onboard staff were very friendly and set up the Q-Suite for us. Service was prompt with welcome drinks served and orders taken for the meal. For some reason even though the flight departs at 01:45 Qatar serves a light supper instead of a breakfast option on arrival, chose the soup which was really good and then had one of the best sleeps ever on a plane. Qatar has to have one of the best products on the market at the moment and will be my carrier of choice if the route is convenient."

While the experience of the flying economy was always great, flying business class takes it to a totally new level. I have flown business class with Emirates and American before, but none of them come even close to what Qatar offers. To start off, Qatar is the only airline that offers on-demand dining, it feels like I am in a 5-star restaurant, the food quality and the in-flight service are always superb, the staff both ground and in-flight are well trained and very professional. I am positive the business class experience in Qatar is better than most airlines first-class service. On my last flight, I chose a lobster dish for my dinner, I can honestly say it was better than any other lobster dish I have tried in many fancy restaurants. Last but not the least, the lounge at Doha airport is one of the best I have ever experienced, from the shower facility to the quality of the food, simply amazing. Please keep it up and I will always pick Qatar over any other airline."

This was sincerely appreciated, particularly given our experience with other carriers flying into Australia who cancelled close to departure without any help in rescheduling or rerouting. As always, the QR experience was top notch. The QSuite and bedding were extremely comfortable, food very good, wine list outstanding and cabin crew service exemplary. Check-in and transit in Doha were seamless. I was a big fan of QR before this experience, however the way in which they handled our re-accommodated into Brisbane has now earned them my loyalty. A stark contrast to other carriers flying into Australia during the pandemic."

I feel that on all flights the comfort pack travellers receive is inadequate and not up to the standard of other airline standards. On the return, the check-in at Larnaca was one of the worst I have ever experienced. The was 1 business class counter and one bag drop counter. The agent on duty was expected to scan every travel document manually (although this information was in the booking already) which resulted in a minimum check-in time of 2o mins per pax and long queues. Two wheelchairs were booked for Doha; they were only aware of one. The system with the golf carts was chaotic and when questioned the staff said it was unavoidable as they were short-staffed. As we had a 7-hour layover in Doha we decided to use the ""Quiet Lounge"". The design of these cubicles is non-sensical: they contain either one uncomfortable, narrow couch plus an armchair and footstool or 2 chairs and a footstool. Neither is comfortable enough to sleep on and loads of space that could have been better utilized is available for hanging garments and suitcases. Qatar need to streamline their business class offering so that it is excellent in every way not just the seating on board."

When I became a member of their Student Privilege Club, I was surprised by the benefits they offered me, such as free WiFi and additional baggage. The flight from Kyiv to Montreal via Doha was my first flight with Qatar Airways, and I can say that I was satisfied (even though the journey was too long and tedious). Qatar Airways has excellent service (refreshing towels at the beginning of the flight), they offer nice food (and the good thing is the online menu so that you can make a choice before your flight). The food was tasty, and the portions are big (I think I spend half of my time aboard eating). On the 5h flight from Kyiv to Doha, they offered 2 meals + snacks, on the 12h flight from Doha to Montreal, I had 2 meals + sandwich + snacks. The seats are comfy, the legroom in the economy is okay (but for long flights, if you have money better to take a business class). In addition to the standard kit - pillow + blanket - they gave protective kits on both flights and amenity kit on a long flight (that was actually very useful for me since I always forget my eye mask and earplugs). Regarding entertainment, they offer many movies + as I mentioned there is WIFI aboard, but it was not working quite often. I had a layover in Doha for more than 10h at night. The airport is nice and easy to navigate through. But the layover was too long. In general, my experience with Qatar Airways was pleasant."

Thought I could upgrade from Economy to Business, but their Privilege Club is further degrading and has abolished that option. Nowadays, it is almost impossible to pay and book online due to increased security causing it to be a several days’ project to issue a ticket. Award tickets cannot be booked without instantly paying taxes. And, online payments could not be effected from Rwanda due to code/country problems to receive OTP. Thus, even temporarily bookings can’t be made unless done directly by QR over phone at higher fares and lots of troubles involving use of other people’s credit cards. Check-In in Kigali easy, though must be in Airport 4 hours prior to departure due to Corona prevention measures. Granted Lounge access to Pearl lounge which is acceptable. Must pay for luxury beverages. But a variety of hot food and snacks offered makes up for it. All flights on B-787-8. Long haul Economy Class QR is top notch and matches economy+ on other airlines. They have improved economy class services since I travelled with them last time; 18 months ago. FAs are attentive and extremely concerned of elite travellers like myself – I have a fainting Gold Card, but was addressed by name throughout I was given the best seats possible in economy among options provided. Drinks were offered frequently. Call bells responded to quickly. Three choices of hot food on every long leg: plenty of it, and I got more if requested. No seafood, mutton, fish or exotic meat offered. English breakfast without bacon? Salads average and desserts were excellent. Sparkling wine (Cava) and wines. Beers offered are still embarrassing: only two, similar, dull lagers offered: Stella Artois and Budweiser – Heineken has gone but that does not add to the repertoire, anyway. The leg DOH-CPH offered two meal rounds. First, a Champagne brunch (3 meal options). Then, a heavy sandwich prior to descend. I was given 3 seats through seat-block for elite travellers. FFP-lounges in Doha are temporarily upgraded to become the Al Mourjan - even for economy travelers with card status. In CPH my luggage came out as the first. A pleasant travel. About as good as it gets in Economy."

I used Qatar Airways for my annual visit to my family in Germany. Yes - the check-in service at Frankfurt Airport could have been organised a bit better, I had to queue for ca. 45 minutes. However, I give 5 stars because the cabin service was excellent, especially during the last leg of my journey, e.g. from Qatar to Johannesburg. The stewardess attending to me responded to my queries with patience and friendliness - certainly relieving some of the stress so typical for long-distance travelling. "

Turns out, they never processed our flights voucher credits properly (which they admit but still no resolution) and 18 months later we are still waiting. When you call the CC be prepared to be on hold for up to 1.5 hours if you can get into the queue. Numerous attempts to contact/resolve and still nothing. July 2021 CC sent Doha Sr. Mgmt a priority ticket to investigate and was told to call back in 48 hours. Nothing. Then told wait 10 days, then until after the holiday in Qatar, then the CC rep says you will have your new voucher numbers by July 31, 2021 by email. Nothing. Called Aug 14 2021 for update, nothing. Told that CC just initiated a second priority ticket to Doha. They couldn’t properly register my new email for communication (it’s changed since original booking). We are out of a lot of $$. 18 months later and still waiting for our voucher numbers that we are entitled to so we can rebook. "

The first leg of the flight was delayed and passengers had to miss their connecting flight from Doha, so I had to wait in Doha for a full day and night. Initially, the airport staff told us no hotel would be available, but they will try to get us lounge access, and directed us to the next customer service desk. When I inquired again about lounge access, they told us no lounge is available because the airport is too busy. We gave you a meal voucher though and here is a blanket. You can rest in the Quiet Room. And that was all the service I received for 24 hours. One meal voucher and a blanket. Since airport staff was not helpful, I called the Customer Service line to ask for some form of compensation given that no accommodation was provided, and missing the connecting flight was completely the airline's fault. The staff on the phone questioned me, ""Are you sure? We have 5 lounges over there. Are you sure they are all full? Did you go to them to check?"" When I asked about a  flight upgrade  they said ""We don't do that."" "

The reservations system is clumsy and full of frustrating redundancies in terms of data input. You need to re-enter country of residence and nationality at payment time despite having done that already for the booking.  The problems arise when there is a bug and it becomes unavoidable to deal with a human operator. And this is where the nightmare starts. The operators, while usually courteous, are unable to do anything useful. In our case, they kept telling us there was nothing wrong with our corrupt data. In one instance, calling the Swiss desk, my call was broken and they would hang it up as we tried to call back. The Doha call center was easier to talk to, but they could not see, let alone fix the data problems. They made us believe that problems would be fixed at check-in or at the transit desk. Upon reaching the Doha stopover around midnight, we got kicked around from desk to desk (transit, to lounge, to ticketing, to upgrade before you fly. And at every stop,  ""we can't help you here, but no worries, your solution is at the next stop"". Nobody did the right thing when a system error is causing additional cost or reduced opportunity. On our previous trip, we checked-in to the Doha Al-Mourjan lounge with two paid up vouchers of which one was mysteriously not showing in their system. They treated us like suspects of having forged the voucher, it took 45 minutes of misery at 1 AM, with them absolutely refusing to let us take a rest while they investigated the bug, despite us offering them to take a debit on our credit card as a safety.  On the latest flight with them, we spent a night in Doha on a chair in a crowded, noisy hall because of the bug that prevented us for 10 days from booking the lounge which was part of planning this trip.

The flight from Tehran to Doha was late for about two hours. Because of the delay, I lost my next flight from Doha to Seattle. Flight delay can happen for whatever reason, and all airlines have a policy of how to handle such a situation and take care of their passenger. The problems started when we landed at Doha international airport. The Qatar airways assistance guided us to the ""ransfer desk to arrange our missed flight. The ""Transfer desk"" had us wait right behind their door for hours to assign our next flight. In my case, I had to wait for more than two hours to get my next flight boarding pass from Doha to Seattle twenty-four hours later. Unfortunately, they didn’t offer any hotel, lounge, or a voucher to get a shower. Qatar Airways accommodations for their mistake and staying in an airport for twenty-four hours were two cups of coffee, two cookies, and a dirty blanket. Later at night, I went back to the  Transfer Desk to ask if they could give me at least a blanket that they did. However, it was dirty. So, I went back to Transfer Desk and I asked to talk to the deputy manager. Qatar Airways Transfer Desk deputy manager admitted the problem of the blanket, but she was unwilling even to touch the blanket they gave me 10 minutes earlier. "

The inflight meals were really good, I had three options to choose from both of my flights. On the Boston- Doha, they served 4 meals consisting of dinner, 2 hot snacks and 1 breakfast. The crew was really nice and friendly, they made sure everyone had a good time. Qatar airways also offers wifi where for 60 minutes every passenger gets it for free and if you want for your whole journey, you can pay 10$ which is a pretty cheap deal compared to Emirates that charges more.

I was stranded at the airport and had to make my way to find a hotel in town. Even though my exemption for certain entry requirements has been confirmed by literally every official venue in Italy, Qatar Airways won't acknowledge that I was wrongfully denied boarding and claiming any sort of compensation for their mistake has been an uphill battle of repeated dismissals.

We are glad that we chose Qatar Airways who made us feel safe and relieved. Transfer desk staff at Montreal were friendly and helpful in sorting out some last minute challenges on travel clearance. They gave us a meal voucher since all business class lounges were closed in Montreal airport. Boarding was streamlined to ensure social distance. Upon boarding the crew introduced and explained the cabin features. The amenity kid, COVID PPE kit, duvet were all ready at the seat and the crew offered the pyjamas. We chose the refreshing lemon mint signature drink prior to take off. The Qsuite is truly a first class business class suite with great comfort and privacy, could not ask for anything more. The couple suite rear facing was great offering us more personal space with the divider removed. The beverage and meal service was prompt and on demand. We miss the trolley service where you get to choose the options and appreciate the presentation but that is understandable during COVID times. One of the cabin crew was convincing my wife hard to have the breakfast since she skipped the dinner service. The crew wear their full PPE including gown and safety glasses and the passengers are required to wear masks at all times. The washrooms were kept clean at all times, however I felt the A350 washrooms bit smaller than the B777 ones. The transit experience in Hamad airport was smooth and refreshing. The 3 hours went by quick with shower facilities, spacious seating options and dining options on the upper level. The stand out was the consistency of care, genuinity and hospitality of the cabin crew - makes such a positive difference and validated our decision of choosing Qatar Airways especially during the challenging Covid times.

I provided records of my  72 hr pcr test and even my vaccination certificate. The staff then told me to call back for a update. To this date, after providing all the justification, I have yet to receive justification why I was not allowed to board my flight after meeting all the requirements, or help in rebooking my flight if a mistake was made. Throughout this whole ordeal, no one from has made any attempts to make contact with me to resolve the issue. All the communication was initiated by me (through numerous phone calls, supplying information on email to both airport operations team and customer care, and visiting the airport customer service desk).

Ernest Nichols",,6th May 2021,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Male to Chicago via Doha,April 2021,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,1,no,5,"  Doha to Chicago on 30th April. Evasive phone numbers, and no customer service email address? Their policy states that if a flight is set back more than 3 hours, other than weather, or an act of God,  you will be refunded. After having to offload and reboard a second plane totalling nearly 4 hours, one would think you'd be compensated. Especially after missing the next flight, and setting me back another 9 hours. After countless hours trying to get someone that will actually listen you hear the words, we are not responsible, nor refundable. The rudeness and evasive accountability is astounding. "

Their service, food and entertainment is amazing. However, this time I was perplexed by their services. I was leaving Najaf airport and the plane was late. I have notified the ground crew that I have a quick connecting flight and was nervous that I would miss my connecting flight. They reassured me that all will be well. We arrived into Doha and I missed my connecting flight. What happened next threw my experience into the negative zone. My next flight have been scheduled at 1855 hrs (18 hours later). The Qatar Airways staff told me that they did not have an hotel room left and he would offer me a complimentary meal voucher and I could find a place in the airport to lie down and relax. I told him that the meal voucher meant little to me since the delay in flight was their problem. If they could not arrange accommodation for me in the airport, the least they could do was upgrade my next flight. He asked me to wait as he spoke to his manager and 30 minutes later I was in a hotel room. The flight to Nairobi was amazing with great service and I cant complain about the air crew. However this experience really had me thinking about flying with Qatar in the future."

We checked in at the Qatar Airways desk about 4 hours before departure, and we very thankful that we had got to the airport so early as all our documents for the return trip, i.e. Certificate of a Negative Covid Test, the UK government's Passenger Locator Form, and the receipt for the two obligatory Covid tests that are required by the UK government when in self-isolation within the UK, were meticulously checked by check-in staff, the whole process taking 25 minutes. Boarding the aircraft at Bangkok was the most professional and well controlled that I have ever experienced at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport; whereas they normally descend into chaos as soon as boarding is announced. My wife and I were pleasantly surprised by the modernity and cleanliness of the aircraft that we boarded, everything we needed for the flight, e.g. facemasks, hand cleanser, ear plugs etc were all neatly arranged in the seat pockets in front of us. The cabin crew were very smartly dressed and neatly turned out, and they were very polite, attentive and visibly present throughout the whole flight. The in-flight meals were of the very highest standard, and probably the best that I have ever been served on a flight back to the London. We arrived in Doha on schedule, and boarded flight at the correct time and the boarding was conducted with the same proficient manner as out first flight. The London bound plane was absolutely jammed pack, but the cabin crew, although extremely busy, behaved with the same quiet and firm professionalism that I had experienced throughout. I witnessed an incident whereby a passenger removed his facemask and refused to put it back on, this passenger was immediately dealt with in a very firm and thoroughly professional manner, which was very reassuring for other passengers around. I was impressed all round by the carrier and I certainly will consider using Qatar Airways in the future."

C Dean",,14th March 2021,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Boston to Doha,March 2021,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  We didn’t get to fly with Qatar Airways after booking with them months previously because they were so rigid about their change rules. You can book a Qsuite and the day before the flight they can change it to a regular seat. They will allow you to change to a different flight without a change fee but you would have to pay the difference in fare which for us was $10,000 a person. They will not allow you to mix business and economy seats on any of your fight, any leg or coming back or anything. Since we needed to change just one leg of our flight (Doha to Male) since we had to cancel our stopover in Doha due to COVID and we didn’t want to pay $20,000 more, we canceled our entire flight at the last minute and booked economy with Emirates who was happy to have us upgrade to Business for just one leg.  I asked why you can’t mix business and economy and they said it’s because the baggage fees are different. I said I would pay the baggage fee difference.  I asked why not and she said “you can’t ask why not”."

I was going to meet my girlfriend in Panama. She ran into a problem on the second leg of the trip because of needing to have a visa to change planes in USA and needed a visa for that. They had a flight a few hours later which would not of been a problem. Qatar said she needed to go though ticket agency. ASAP did nothing to help and blamed it on Qatar. After trying for three weeks with is both paying hotel rooms they could not help since all their flights went though USA. I later checked with them about a flight and it is no problem going though Spain which was no problem. Canceled the trip and we both went home to separate countries. I will not use ASAP again and was able to get a refund from credit card company on her trip. Of course by then spending time, thousands of dollars and way to much stress. Never thought I would use Qatar again either. Another trip to Thailand and Qatar was the best deal and schedule so against my better judgment I tried them again. What a surprise. Everything went very easy, I had to change flight twice because of visa issues but no charge and easy to do. Everything about my flight was great.

She was the key to the success of my very stressful and complexe arrival in Australia. Being my first time travelling to Australia for my employer, in the worst possible time due to the reality of COVID-19, with the strict rules of Australia (that are somewhat a bit complex to follow), she got me on that plane.

Travelling on Qatar Airways recently was a stress free, COVID safe, comfortable experience from start to finish. The check in process wasn't perfect, but with all the changes to legislation of various countries, I did expect things to be a little slower. This in my opinion is acceptable in the current climate. When on the flight, there were plenty of seats available to maintain some form of social distance, the crew wore correct PPE and enforced passengers to do the same. The crew issue a travel pack which contained sufficient face masks, gloves and hand sanitiser for the trip and onward journey. Food on the flight was tasty and the drinks service was sufficient to remain comfortable through out the trip. On arrival at Doha, all passengers was ushered through to transfers, by passing the unnecessary security check points allowing us to, again maintain social distancing. I had a long layover so utilised an airport lounge but I did noticed the majority of the stores open in Doha Airport. My trip involved two flights which both arrived on time at their respective destinations. Overall, I was very impressed how COVID safe and comfortable the journey was, and that is travelling economy. I am going to be using Qatar Airways as my first choice airline for the considerable future. Thank you, keep doing, what you are doing!"

The whole experience was great - checking-in, counter service, boarding, seat and leg space, entertainment program, exiting, etc. A special shout out for the food between Doha and Bangkok which was probably the best I ever had on a plane. The only thing why it is not 10/10 is the loading speed and UX / UI of both, mobile and desktop booking process. They seriously need to upgrade this as it is a bit painful and it takes a long time. As an airline, however, I can highly recommend them!"

Doha to Sao Paulo was a 16 hour flight but the miles and time seemed to just fly by on their impeccable service standards. The A350 was immaculate and clean and the cabin crew so gracious that nothing was too much trouble for them. Plenty of food and constant drink servings. I flew Economy but they made you feel like you are valued and important. Especially the young kind hearted South African cabin crew lady. Flying QR in December you got Free WIFI for the entire flight and it largely worked well. QR sets the standard that all other airlines should strive for.

Food was amazing, they had also a precaution set of several items against covid 19. No one removed their mask during the entire trip and also had a face shield unless they were eating. Leg space and seats were really comfortable. The entertainment content is amazing which made the time pass, i loved the fact that the screens are large compared to other airlines and i was able to recharge my phone as well and had internet access during most of the trip for Free!

The service on both flights was excellent. Nothing is too much trouble, the staff are always polite, and they deserve all the praise for their patience and attentiveness.

We flew from Paris to Cape Town via Doha with Qatar Airways in Business Class, and this was probably the best choice, as everything went perfect. From the boarding in CDG up to the disembarking in CPT, the whole experience was great. The Q-Suite concept, as well as the ""family suite"" concept have been very well designed. The attendants service and food and beverages quality are the highest standards I have ever experienced in the industry. For me, Qatar Airways is definitely the best airline for Business Class. I could say that Qatar is for me today part of the travel destination decision, in the sense that I am prioritizing destinations where Qatar Airways can fly me to!"

However the return flight was cancelled due to Covid. Qatar Airways was offering a change of date in place of return flight or refund or voucher. I recently contacted Customer services to arrange my return flight this has been very difficult and I've been told that they issued me with a voucher without me requesting this option. I have tried to have this rectified to enable me to book the return flight home to replace the original cancelled flight. The customer services have not been helpful in regard to this option, they now want to charge me a further amount for return flight offering the voucher value as discount on the ticket I require. After further discussions as to why a voucher was issued they inform me that another party had requested this without my consent or knowledge. Despite this they tell me that they are unwilling to put the error right and issue me with a return ticket.

T Kane",Boeing 777,28th November 2020,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Sydney to London via Doha,October 2020,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,,5,no,4,"  We flew Sydney-Doha-London business class. We'd not flown business before so we thought we would treat ourselves, our bookings were made well in advance pre-Covid. Due to the restrictions on flying our flight got pushed back until we finally got clearance to fly one year after our initial booking and six months after our intended flight. Changing our tickets was simplicity and the person dealing with the change was very helpful. Checking in at Sydney was average with the check in staff doubling up with gate duties, there were only four flights departing Sydney that evening so they weren't exactly rushed off their feet. The flight was uneventful which is how you want it. The service was exemplary, very attentive and the food was delicious with plenty of it. The seat although lie flat wasn't as comfortable as I was expecting and on the 14 hour flight I got somewhere between 2-3 hours of sleep. The in flight entertainment was average with few major movies available. We had three hours at Doha before catching our onward flight to Heathrow and we used most of the three hours in the spacious lounge refreshing ourselves. The onward flight was a repeat of the first flight, generally pleasant with the same caveats as before. Overall the onboard experience was very good. But what marred the flight was after we got to our isolation destination to find out an expensive electrical item had been badly damaged despite it being marked as fragile. Qatar's response was effectively 'tough, that's the terms of service that we had signed up for' and they declined to take responsibility or consider my claim for damages. "

The pleasure is only getting bigger when I travel with Qatar Airways, they are in my opinion the best. Especially since we got the Corona last year, Qatar Airways made it very easy for their customers, to make changes and rebook tickets when most of the world went bananas and closed everything. You can always count on Qatar to take you where you need to go. I strongly believe that when you're treated good you need to be loyal. Therefore I will probably stay with them for the rest of my life. I simply love Qatar Airways and the service they provide to me!"

As a British National on April 27th I took the repatriation flight to Heathrow, the aircraft was great,very modern.... Service was excellent. To this day I have been unable to return to Qatar.

However, opposed to their website stating that date changes are free of charge, it's not always the case and I would have had to pay regular fare change and rebooking fees. Quite unclear when the free date change applies! So I had to stick to the original travel date. Seats in A350 economy are very narrow in width and I don't want to imagine being squeezed into them in a full flight. Luckily for us passengers, both flights were only 1/3 or less full on all flights. They put all passengers in the rear part of the cabin for departure, after which you're free to roam around and pick a free row to sit or sleep, which made the trip very enjoyable. Wifi was free for the whole duration of the flight and quite reliable. It's a good and bad thing at the same time, flying no longer is the time to disconnect for a couple of hours.

We paid for a full fare business class ticket in the end, we just paid it via an upgrade and did it for two extra legs of the trip. (Currently sitting in the transit lounge, as we luckily have other lounge accesses). It's true that in fine print at the bottom of the email under the 'upgrade here' you will find that the upgrade doesn't allow lounge access - however, they hide it. "

They are taking every reasonable step to make flying safe during covid, insisting on masks and on some routes, pre-flight testing. They also give face shields to every passenger at time of boarding, and implement social distancing. All of these measures help the passenger to feel safe and comfortable in the choice to travel at this time.

Due Covid-19 everything was cancelled and I agreed to receive a voucher. Now I rebooked my flight, again in Business Class, but the amount of my voucher was not enough, I had to pay also some extra costs. There is currently a promotion active which lets you earn many bonus miles - so I contacted Qatar if I will be able to collect these miles. The answer was no. You booked this flight with a voucher from an earlier, cancelled flight, so I am not eligible for the current promo. If this depends on the initial flight, I was eligible to earn 3 x QPoints from the previous flight?  I want to clarify that the service on board is still amazing, the crews do a great job.

They told me I had to contact the Malaysian embassy and obtain that before they could let me board. I was devastated as it was already close to departure time. I went and sat down and called my family in Malaysia and told them about my situation and at the sane time going online to find out what the requirement was to enter Malaysia even though I’m a Malaysian citizen. Apparently, it’s a letter that I have to sign in order to undertake to pay for my quarantine in Malaysia (which didn’t apply to me as I was going home to my state of Sarawak and Sarawak would bear all my quarantine expenses since I’m a Sarawakian). My family advised me to call my cousin’s daughter who is an immigration officer in Kuala Lumpur. I was just about to call her when one of the gate agents called me back to the podium. Apparently, one of the Qatar Airways employee working that day thought outside the box, went online to the Malaysian website and printed out that letter for me. I filled out my particulars and signed it in front of her. She handed it to me and told me to hand it to the Malaysian authorities when I arrive. She then gave me back my documents and boarding passes and told me to have a nice flight! I didn’t get a chance to get all their names who worked flight 726 In Chicago but these employees deserve some kind of raise or extra bonus etc. Then, on board that flight the inflight crews were very attentive to passengers’ needs and very polite and sweet!

Given the current situation, I felt at ease as all passengers were required to wear both face masks and a face shield. Temperature checks were also require prior to boarding. Qatar Airways seems to be taking the pandemic very seriously, which is great to see, as they supplied us with spare masks, gloves and hand sanitiser, all complimentary. Frustratingly, the screens at London Heathrow stated “flight closing” when the flight hadn’t even started boarding yet, and this caused a number of passengers to panic considering the huge size of Terminal 5 and the amount of time it can take to cross the terminal to get to your gate. I was very surprised with how spacious the aircraft was. There was plenty of leg room and it was great to see Qatar Airways adhere to social distancing regulations - no two passengers were seated next to one another unless travelling as a group. The meal services provided onboard were fantastic. They had more selection than other airlines I’ve flown with in the past. Cabin crew were generally very welcoming and friendly. My connection in Doha was only 1 hour, however this was plenty of time for me and my bags to make it to the other aircraft in time. Overall a great experience - if you’re nervous about flying during the current pandemic, I would highly recommend considering Qatar Airways as their Covid-19 rules and regulations put me at ease and it was great to see them taking the safety of passengers and crew seriously."

I am a graduate student that is bound to fly home after the completion of my studies. Firstly, the price of the flight was very affordable,  I paid less than 500usd for this flight. Qatar Airways allowed unlimited changes to flight schedule without any extra fees or charges (with some terms). I made 3 changes to my flights and they were all done via the phone to the customer service hotline, which was accessible.  The flight attendents, food served and comfort of the flight was unparalleled. There is nothing for me to complain about. I only have nice words to say about this recent flight home to Singapore. There is no doubt that I think Qatar Airways is deserving of being the top airline. I want to make a special mention of thanks to customer service officer, Andrew (I hope i got your name right) who was empathetic of my 10 hour layover in Doha and gave me options of a lounge. He was empathetic and his professionalism and friendly demeanor an asset to Qatar."

I am 26 weeks pregnant and travelling by myself and onboard cabin crew was very helpful from the time I entered the aircraft until I disembark. They carried my bags and stored them in the overhead bin, offered me extra food, moved me to a another seat with more space as I was pregnant and needed to stretch and and I will feel more comfortable with more space. When I went to galley area to stretch my legs a bit, cabin crew was very engaging offering me not only food and drinks but also asking my well-being always with a warm smile."

S Neleiran",,20th August 2020,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Beirut to Los Angeles via Doha,August 2020,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,2,no,1,"  My husband booked a ticket for myself and kids from their website. We received a confirmation email from them with our eticket's. I tried to contact Qatar Airways via phone at their listed airport number for two weeks to inquire and add our pet to our reservation.  Also tried reaching out on their facebook page but still no answer. We ended up leaving our pet behind. Upon arriving at the airport, the agent informed me that my husband's credit card should be present for verification. I told them that I had the same credit card with the same account number/credit card number because we share the same account but my card is under my name. They refused it and were about to send me back home. The supervisor informed me that an email was sent to us for credit card verification. I informed them that I did not get such an email. I contacted my husband who was in the US and he also did not get an email. I quickly searched my junk mail and found that it was sent to me the day before the flight. I sat in the airport and submitted all required documents online (luckily I had all what they required available). We waited for QA customer support to verify but they did not. They tried to call them from the airport but they did not answer and they did not even reply to the emails they were sending. The supervisor then told me that the only option left was for me to put down another payment and once they finish the credit card verification, then they'd refund me. I used the same credit card and we were on our way. At Doha airport (transit) I seemed to remember leaving behind my expensive headphones hanging on the hand of my seat. I immediately asked a QA agent to have a staff member get it for me since i was not allowed back onto the plane. The agent called the lost and found office instead and got no answer. He assured me that they'd send it for me once found. I told him that I was still here at the airport and it would be quick to just get it now, he did not seem able to help. At Los Angeles airport, they seemed to have lost one of my luggage. The agents there assured me that all luggages were transferred and were onboard and another customer has grabbed my bag. I filed a missing bag form and they called me the next day to inform me that it was found. Upon inquiring where the bag was at, the agent told me that it was left behind in Beirut airport. Once I got home, I checked my credit card and found that the two charges for our airline tickets were both cleared. I emails customer support and until this moment did not receive my refund. I had to file a dispute with my credit card and since I had all proof that I was double charged, my credit card has immediately refunded my money back. They found my headphones and I have to drive to nearest airport to get them. Their inflight service is good, however not worth the headache they put me through."

Finally, we were able to get on a repatriation flight through Qatar airways. When we arrived to A,,an Airport, it was chaos, hundreds of people waiting outside the airport entrance to get in. This only added to the anxiety. However, once we got to the Qatar Airways check in, everything was very professional. We checked in online which sped up the process. Our baggage was several kgs overweight, so we needed to rearrange our packing. When we were doing this Khalil the duty manager came over and told us not to worry about the extra weight and he allowed it through. This was a lovely gesture and we were very grateful. The service before and when we got on the plane was top class. All the safety equipment was provided and the cabin crew were professional but at the same time friendly and warm, which is really important during these difficult times. On a final note there was a very ill man on the flight from Doha to Bangkok, one of the cabin crew stayed by his side for most of the flight while also carrying out her other duties. She was a very pleasant lady, I never got her name but she did a great job."

Pre-flight service from both Doha Customer Service and, in particular, the ground staff at Milan-Malpensa was faultless. I was bumped from a previous flight by the Australian Border Force, despite having the correct NSW Health transit exemption paperwork (which NSW Health later admitted and apologized for). That time, the check-in staff at Milan-Malpensa bent over backwards in an effort to allow me to board but in the end, could not prevail, through no fault of their own. I was a very frequent traveller until recently (all airlines); I rank my recent flight experience with Qatar Airways amongst the best that I can recall."

Dinner was served with wine and was excellent and then the hostess puta soft mattress on the bed which already had a very nice soft pillow and it was happy dreams for the next 8 hours. A couple of hours before landing in Doha a nice breakfast was served and we landed on time. Better things still to come .. the transit to the flight to Madrid was achieved by simply walking to the departing gate without having to go through the hand luggage and passport checks again. The 8 hour flight to Madrid was in a A350-900 which was comfortable but the seat was less private. Everything was wonderful except the crew may have been just a tad over attentive. Still,the plane arrived on time. I paid for this flight with a voucher plus an additional 10% from a cancelled flight with Qatar. Qatar had also repaid to my credit card a fare from another cancelled flight so I must applaud their integrity . Thank you Qatar!!"

Global pandemics throw everyone into chaos - including us having been shifted to remote work overnight - and getting an update from anyone at Qatar Airways was very challenging: to follow-up called 50+ times to their Doha and Helsinki numbers without success during March-April-May 2020 at different times of the day, the longest wait being 1½ hours. No emails, no updates but the mere word ""Open"" on their web page. Phone calls and follow-up forms were submitted to no avail.

They took her to a lounge and left her there and someone else came later to assist her to flight, no real issues. I realised while checking in on the way back to the UK that the accompanied on the ticket didn't include the return leg which I asked for and assumed with the price paid was completed. We checked at the desk and said he'd sorted it out and all was arranged. She landed in Qatar and was told by the staff on the plane to speak to the staff as she got off which she did.

While the plane was near empty and the cabin crew wore full PPE, they were really the only indications that we're in the midst of a global pandemic. Food and drink offering were top notch and the QSuite is possibly the best business class product available. The cabin crew were as engaging and hospitable as ever despite the limitations of working in full PPE - they really wanted to ensure we were comfortable and enjoying the flight. Hamad International Airport was empty as was the Al Mourjan Business Lounge so our seven hour transit was a breeze. I admire Qatar Airways for at least attempting to provide a normal level of business class service during these difficult times when almost every other airline has significantly cut their service."

The cabin crew were fantastic especially the one female crew who took care of her ""like her own mother"". My mother's clothes were spoiled and they helped her change and clean, and every 10 minutes that kind female cabin crew visited her and made sure she was comfortable. I cannot thank Qatar airways enough to train your crew well. Shout out to that amazing, wonderful kind woman and to the whole crew for not making my mother feel unwanted and uneasy. Thank you!

However we managed to get on a UK charter flight to Manchester via Doha to Melbourne recently. This review should really cover the Manchester to Melbourne flight via Doha. We required wheelchair assistance and medical oxygen so it was not a straight forward flight. We have so many people to thank and especially Qatar Airlines which will be the subject of the review here. Customer service was excellent. Qatar Cyprus (Eleni) reached out to us to assist us. Qatar Airways waived all charges for changing the route completely. Once they approved the wheelchair and oxygen they swung into action, we had excellent assistance from Check in to boarding and then disembarking. We were told many times that they will take care of the medical needs by the cabin crew who checked on us frequently during the flight. At Doha, we were picked up and transported to the different gates effortlessly and efficiently and were allowed to stop to get some sandwiches We have nothing but the utmost praise for the cabin crew (Flights QR 28 and QR 904 11th May 2020) for looking after us. Safety due to virus From videos to cleaning the toilets frequently and wearing the appropriate safety gear, they kept us safe during the flight. It can't be easy on the cabin crew as they are exposed to passengers all the time so they are like frontline healthcare professionals. My deep respect for the cabin crews. Qatar Airways - We will get you home (catch cry at the moment). Thank you Qatar for getting us home. Whilst most major airlines abandoned us, you kept flying. You upgraded your safety levels to manage the virus and you kept flying. You are the only major airline that kept flying to Australia. You deserve an award for this. Thank you for flying and as one of your ground staff in Doha said ""Qatar will always keep flying no matter what"". We wish you the staff and everyone all the best."

This was a itinerary booked with Qatar Airways to Mauritius (with Kenya Airways providing Nairobi to Mauritius flight sector). Manchester to Nairobi flight was good, with ample seat space. Cabin crew kind and attentive throughout. Special meals (Vegetarian Ovo Lacto) was nice. The flight from Doha was even better, with great service and meals of great quality. Generous baggage allowance of 30kg per passenger. Despite the minor issues of delays at check-in at Manchester Airport and some mild chaos at boarding (not due to Qatar Airways, and more Manchester Airport ground staff), I really enjoyed my first flights with Qatar Airways. Transiting through Hamad International Airport was a breeze, despite the bus transfers and a one hour transfer layover time in Doha, but love the airport. Obviously was very much looking to the return flights, but due to cancellation due to the Coronavirus, this did not happen and flew back with Air Mauritius to London Heathrow (review to follow). The flights however will be delayed and will use them in the next 12 months on another Qatar Airways Flight, if they decline my request for a refund. In all, a great experience. Much better than Emirates for sure in terms of cost, baggage allowance and cabin service. Such a shame they do not fly directly to Mauritius - maybe the Mauritian Government read this and approve their application for landing rights on the island - it’s one, if not the best airline around."

At this moment, the pilots actually made two rounds with our plane, presumably just to let the passengers admire that lovely view before landing.

Doha was unexpectedly good, with airbridge (disembarkation and helpful ground staff to point you in the right direction. London Qatar lounge good, Al Mourjan Business lounge in Doha very good and Qantas Lounge in Adelaide also very good. Upgraded to Al Safwa First Lounge on the way back, which was something else. Ensuite bedroom included, so actually cheaper than a lay-over hotel. But still a luxury. Qsuite is every bit as good as advertised. We flew in the central backward facing seats on the way out. Great novelty factor and the flight literally flew by (no pun intended). Food and drink are amazing, and the flights were simply not long enough to get through it all between London and Adelaide. By the time you've finished playing with the seat, had a few drinks, eaten, watched the movies and slept, you've arrived-feeling raring to go. No jet lag either way and so straight into the holiday. Sat on the window seats on the way home, as the one drawback of the centre seats is no individual air vents, which meant the cabin got stuffy. In the A350 900, the second, smaller cabin is better (almost empty, very quiet) and on the A350 1000, front cabin is better, as the rear one is closer to the galley and WC. Lovely crews who all introduce themselves and remember your name.As always, positive interaction always repaid in full. Bravo Qatar for a once in a lifetime return trip."

Lounges acceptable. They apply rigid serving due to “rules, regulations, and policy”. No true warmth to me from FA. Elite Frequent Flyers depraved 50% or more of their miles due to devalued and rigid, intransparent program. When denied entry in Vietnam they left me in transit in Danang for 5 hours. On the return they did not issue me a ticket and wanted me to pay for return ticket which I refused as they were the one accepting me in the first place.

I fly Qatar as my airline of choice when I can and have flown them many times, but this is my first review on this platform and just for one flight on one of their A380s, despite having flown on them numerous times. I choose Qatar purely because it is the one airline for me that has a benchmark of standards that are consistently applied across its cabin staff in particular and the aircraft in service. I know that if I fly a smaller A319 from Bucharest to Doha for example or an A380, 777 or A350 long haul, that the cabin crew will be just as polished and polite on each service and the aircraft turned out immaculately. I have flown Qatar in economy and Business, but I am yet to try their First Class product. I have tried the Q-Suite on the 777-ER and for me, that is better than many first-class products on other airlines so no need to try first class!! I am looking forward to flying on the A350-1000 in a few weeks time and will continue to fly Qatar where I can, for me they are the benchmark airline in the industry for onboard service. The one downside for me is their Rewards program which I think is very rigid and overly taxing in terms of reward points they charge for upgrades etc and what they give as rewards. I think they can be more generous with their Privilege Club members, as there are far better rewards programs out there, this is the one area they let themselves down."

I've flown with Emirates, Etihad, BA, Singapore and others over the years but my favourite, without contest, and the one I always return to, is Qatar. The planes are always impeccably clean and comfortable, with plenty of leg room (I'm just over 6ft), the service is truly excellent, the food (vegetarian, lacto-ovo) is actually really good, I've never experienced delays or missed connections and yet, somehow, Qatar are consistently one of the cheapest options (I just picked up a one way Perth to London in February for £320). The entire experience is always very calm and rather luxurious, even in economy, and the flight route (between Perth and London) is exceptionally fast. It helps that Doha airport is an example of excellence, too. Strongly recommend - but make sure you don't accidentally end up on a BA flight code sharing with Qatar. BA are the worst airline I've ever had the bad luck to fly this route with."

K Beesen",,7th February 2020,Business,Economy Class,Copenhagen to Kathmandu via Doha,February 2020,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  Copenhagen to Kathmandu via Doha. I booked 10 seats for our group travelling on 7th February. There were two flights from Doha to Kathmandu, and when booking they were both nearly full. However after having selected seats for all of us, so that our group could sit together, they combined the two flights into one and our seat reservations were gone. I managed to get some reasonable seats booked again, but I always check in online (right after check-in was opened). To my surprise our seats on rows 12-16 (window) had been swapped to the second last row 54,  next to the toilet and kitchen. Something is really wrong with their systems, or the people managing the flight seating in Copenhagen, on other legs the seats were preserved. When I called Qatar to complain, I got the information, that they  could do nothing - it was all in the hands of the check-in counters in Copenhagen, and I could show up there 3 hours prior to departure, to see if I could book some better seats - for the third time.

The cabin staff conduct themselves with a smiling high quality service. Toilets were constantly refreshed. Seats were comfortable. Food service on demand worked well. Quality of food was superior to some top grade hotels I have stayed in. A fault in the in flight entertainment defied the best attempts by the cabin staff to get it working properly so a change in the seat was organised. The short change overtime at Doha caused us to miss out on accessing the best business class lounge.  As I have to use a wheelchair on arrivals I found the service quite good but there seems to be constant confusion at changeover places. However we still get to the various drop off or change points.

I would like to start off by saying that I have flown by Qatar Airways multiple times in the past and have had pleasant experiences. However, my most recent episode has been unprofessional.

The ticket agents were unempathetic despite me telling them that I had to get back as soon as possible. Even though it was 2 am, local passengers were not offered any transport, compensation, food or accommodation. Instead, we spent the night at the airport."

Six hours after the scheduled departure time and we still had not received text messages. Qatar Airways moved passengers to their flight 24 hours later. We informed Qatar Airways staff that we did not want to be re-routed. and we booked new flights with Emirates.  Qatar Airways forced passengers to wait 24 hours to avoid re-routing customers with a competitor.  Much of this angst could have been avoided if Qatar Airways had been genuine about minimizing disruption to customers. The new flights cost us $1,500 each, which is $650 more each than the original flights. We sought compensation from Qatar and they declined to offer any compensation. Customer service was completely unhelpful and did not make us a token offer. "

Food was excellent, served very professionally, good variety and so very tasty. Staff were, without exception, just outstanding. So very friendly and helpful and went out of their way to please. One member of the cabin crew needs special mention for the excellent and friendly service she provided my wife and I on one of the legs to Colombo and one on return. Deanna can be described as outstanding. She is a credit to Qatar Airways and deserves this recognition."

For the CPH-DOH leg we were in the older Business Class layout, for the DOH-BOM we had Qsuites. While the Qsuites are outstanding, I think there is something to recommend the older layout, too - it feels more open and and it is very spacious. Inflight service on both the legs was superb. Qatar's (paid) wifi also works well. The Al Mourjan lounge in DOH can get crowded but on this occasion we hit it at a less busy hour. Qatar offers probably the finest onboard Business Class product today. The company has work to do regards customer service and support outside the aircraft."

We made several attempts to Qatar airlines to compensate us for the delayed luggage and other costs but to no avail.

I was really impressed and appreciative of the care and attention I was given by staff particularly Prue as I blacked out and landed on the floor in the galley area. She instilled confidence in me with her calm, friendly demeanor and provided oxygen for me.

In fact, in some ways I prefer it - it just seems more spacious and less claustrophobic. Inflight service on both flight was, as usual, warm and efficient.

Then the announcement came to disembark and wait at the gate area with an update provided in about 90 minutes. It was already 1 am. And the it was announced that parts would have to be flown in from Doha before the repair could be completed. Is it believable that JFK airport does not have spares for a Boeing aircraft? We were told to exit the terminal and claim our bags from luggage claim. Lines formed for finding alternative flights. The phone number for customer service went unanswered as it was outside operating hours. No hotel accommodation was provided for local residents. We left and sent emails to Qatar Airways that we were cancelling our journey as they could not operate the flight. In a week our credit card was refunded the price. We bought pricier tickets on Emirates and flew out in the morning having paid for a hotel at the airport and a hotel night at our destination because we arrived very late.

Their attentiveness to the children was brilliant and beyond expectation. Flights back from Bangkok and Doha to Manchester we had a stopover of 4 days in Doha were fine too. The problem was the Bangkok check in staff. If you are travelling from Bangkok make sure that you power banks have a capacity label on because Bangkok Airport security will not allow it to go through if it doesn’t have a capacity label which I learnt to my expense! Mine that I had had for 5 years was in my bag and as going through security must have fallen out of my bag so they checked it and cos it didn’t have a label they refused to let it through. I went back to check in to ask for assistance and staff could only give me advise to take it to the post office and post it to my Uk address (I did go to post office but they refused saying they can’t post batteries). The lack of attentiveness of this check in staff and then her colleague was disgusting. The issue here wasn’t the power bank but it was the sentimental value it had attached to it that can never be replaced. I found out later if staff had given me a letter to say that they give permission for me to take it on the plane then Bangkok Airport security would allow me to take it. "

I wasn't expecting much on an economy fare but 5 minutes later the flight attendant comes back with his supervisor and within minutes my seat was fixed. The supervisor was Deyan and he was exceptional - after fixing my seat, he looked after me and my mother for the entire flight making sure we were comfortable and checking on us from time to time. His customer service and skills was outstanding and because of him, my mother and I have raved about Qatar Airways and will definitely use this airline for our future travels. Thank you to Deyan and the cabin crew for looking after us on our flight with Qatar Airways. What a great first experience!"

I missed my connecting flight from Doha to Cape Town and was stranded at the airport at 01h40, as you can imagine I was very stressedd. One of the staff, Londikile,  kindly comforted me and calmed me down and escorted me to the Transit desk on the other side of the airport. She went to liaise with one of the Supervisors, and they managed to get me onto the next flight to Johannesburg at 07h00. I am truly grateful for the kindness, shown towards me by these 2 special ladies and the staff at the transit desk, who also assisted me, so that I could contact my family in Cape Town. I can see why Qatar Airways has won awards over the last years, as it is due to their friendly service, professionalism and their culture towards their customers. Please convey my heartfelt thanks to these 2 employees, they went beyond and above. "

My flight couldn't land at my destination due to bad weather, which I understand, We were meant to arrive at 5pm but we didn't arrive at our hotel in another part of Malaysia until 10pm. We were informed at 11.30pm that we would get put on the next available flight in the morning. I was told to wake up at 3am for a 4am departure, at the airport I was informed I was not on that morning flight as their wasn't enough space for me and my flight not due to depart until 4:30pm. Frustrated that I missed a night in my hotel I was now angry that I had little sleep and was forced to wake up for a flight that wasn't booked for me. Very poor communication and no apologies were given just that they were ""trying their best"". At the airport there was no manager around, there should have been a manager dealing with the passengers on this flight.  I was informed that I had missed the shuttle back to the hotel so I had to wait another hour until the next shuttle arrived. I demanded they pay to put me in a taxi but they refused. I asked for them to phone Qatar customer service line but they declined. I finally got to the airport and once again my flight was delayed by a further 2 hours. I didn't arrive at my destination until 11pm that night. So a full day wasted. I arrived 31 hours after I was scheduled to arrive at my destination. Qatar Airways refused to provide compensation.  I think this is disgraceful customer service. I will personally never recommend or book with them again."

Nothing to fault in the cabin, seat layout, service etc on the Nice to Doha sector. Quiet, comfortable journey. Outstanding lounge in Doha with a quiet area - ideal for a four hour stopover. The lounge in Terminal 1 at Nice is a tawdry affair but it's the same with the shared lounge for Emirates in Terminal 2. Doha to Bangkok on an old Boeing 777 with a 2x2x2 seat configuration. This is the world's best business class I asked myself. Noisy Boeing 777, uncomfortable seats. So this is what you get for a saver fare? Pyjamas, yes - mattress no. "

Both legs were excellent: staff most attentive, helpful. The layover at Doha was long: about 9 hours (didn't realise when the flight was booked for me). On both flights the staff were most excellent: always helpful, unobtrusive and cheerful. The food was excellent. What I like most about Qatar Airways is that they are very generous with the hot/cold towels (I like the hot version better). Doha airport is quite amazing (much better to my mind than Dubai). Boarding in Geneva was a breeze and the same in Doha. On the Doha - Zurich leg they use the new A350 - which has the little ""cabins"" privacy walls: really nice, unfortunately not on the GVA to PEN route (yet!) Had been meaning to write about the excellent service and food and general quality of the airline for a while (have been on a few flights with them this year - also good prices in Business - depending on the period). During the layover had a shower and a little ""roomette"" - quite spacious actually where you can relax and even sleep. The food and drinks the Business lounge in Doha is excellent: spacious and various choices of ""venues"". At Geneva the lounge is decent, no frills, but OK for Europe. So far all my flights with Qatar this year have been excellent, no negative comments at all. Just one suggestion: wish they had Classical music (Western and Eastern) in their audio choice. Keep it up Qatar Airways!"

I was told by a customer service employee on Facebook chat that my first flight to Doha, which took off around 2PM, would have lunch onboard.  I didn't have lunch before boarding, but, to my surprise, there was no lunch served onboard. The meal was served 3 hours later. Tehran to Lisbon after meal service I started feeling weak, I recognized as an episode of low blood sugar that could be fixed with a high carb snack. I pressed the FA call button, and waited. Pressed again, and waited. No one would come. So I started pressing the call button while trying to get attention from the FA who was in the cabin, she saw me and brought me a piece of bread per my request. FAs were very polite and friendly and our first flight from Lisbon to Doha was blessed by an extremely enthusiastic, super friendly FA called Chung who really lit up the cabin with his positive energy! Most of the time the FAs on all four flights were professional but ignoring the call button is unprofessional. In both situations it's expected that FAs go check what's going on. "

I had taken advantage of a splendid price reduction on one of Qatar Airways occasional sales. First surprise was that the Boeing 777 out of BKK was obviously a last-minute aircraft change. It was not the 2+2+2 layout I checked in for but the new Q Suites. Window seating in odd numbered rows faces backwards which has never bothered me. If traveling alone, the sense of privacy is superb. The meals and wines were excellent and the FAs quietly attentive. The business class layout of the A350 is virtually identical to the Boeing 787 Qatar Airways used to fly on the Edinburgh route, but I found the Airbus generally quite a bit more comfortable. The A330 for the final sector was full and the 2+2+2 business class layout feels a lot more cramped even though the seats fold down to flat beds. Still, the FAs were wonderfully attentive and I managed to sleep most of the way."

Crew just fantastic and make everything possible; great job! Food as always very good, drink list very decent, although Pommery Brut is not my favorite Champagne. Only negative on this leg was the not at all responsive touch screen of the entertainment system. Second leg in a fabulous A350-1000, such a roomy aircraft, quiet and featuring the famous Q-Suite, the best business class seat I have ever flown. Especially the enormous screen is really impressive! Just three restrooms for a very large business cabin somehow did not seem right at all. But although very proactive, the crew was providing a very slow service, forgot to serve my ordered wines, had to be asked 2-3 times before it was brought to the seat. Never experienced such a service flying with Qatar Airways so far. "

The cabin crew are mostly from South Asia. That, plus the food and the large selection of films from that region gave the flights a distinctive South Asian vibe. Many of the passengers too appeared to be from the Subcontinent. Cabin service was of a high standard. The flight attendants tend to be chatty. The Dreamliner business class cabin on the CCU-DOH segment is bright, big, and beautiful. I got a few hours sleep and had an excellent breakfast. The plane after landing was parked at a remote location but an air conditioned bus arrived very promptly and it was dedicated for only biz class passengers. The transit time at Doha was a little over an hour and I did not feel I could make use of the lounge. The DOH-JFK leg was in the airline's vaunted Q-Suites. It felt very enclosed, though cozy. The cabin looked congested and crowded. A large collection of films were in the video library including several Hollywood classics. Meal service is on demand - something I don't care for. The menu list is extensive. Pajamas, sandals, and a toiletry kit were provided on this flight. On the shorter CCU-DOH flight only a toilet kit (a ""cheaper"" version) was on the seat. The biggest surprise was that Qatar airways has discontinued its in-flight duty free shopping, something I have always enjoyed about air travel. There is really nothing to fault on this airline except that on both occasions, the flight attendants had to be reminded to bring me my jacket on arrival which they were so eager to stow away when I boarded. Arrival was at JFK's Terminal 8 where the immigration check was relatively fast and I was out of the terminal in no time. On the CCU-JFK route, the airline is holding up very well from a generally high quality competition from Cathay Pacific/Dragon."

When I tried to call Qatar's helpline, it was closed. I called Qatar head office and they told me that their system tells that we were no show, so according to their terms and conditions we have to buy new tickets which will cost $3500 for two people one way. Even though we had boarding passes and it was not our fault but they told us to take it to up with Porter. I called Porter and they told us that since we never booked with their office they can’t help us and we have to contact Qatar Airways. We stayed up all night continuously trying to get hold of someone from Qatar but to no avail. Next day we went to Porter head office and made a huge scene (whole different story) but at least after 10 hours of bickering and arguing at around 10 p.m. Saturday, they accepted their mistake and told us to go home and they contacted Qatar and got us a flight for Sunday, without any charge, whole 2 days later which with 10 hours layover in Doha to reach Pakistan.

The person in charge in the afternoon apologized for the long wait but damaged was done."

I was flying out with my dog, a native Sri Lankan dog (breed was mixed/mongrel) and it was a nightmare to book. To be fair, it wasn't bad the first time - mixed breed was okay. Unfortunately I had to change the date of my flight and rebook my dog onto the flight, and that's where the nightmare began. The staff wanted to know what breed my dog was, despite my dog not having a breed at all. I called them on a Friday about the dog, they said I would hear from them within 48 hours. That following Wednesday I had to call them because I hadn't heard anything yet, only to find out they never processed the dog in the first place and my flight was that Sunday! Despite not having any problems with ""mixed breed"" the first time, I had loads of problems now. Mixed breed wasn't okay, despite stating it definitely wasn't one of the dogs not allowed to fly. Mongrel wasn't okay either. I eventually got approved just over a day before the flight. It was an absolute nightmare to deal with - but from others I heard that Qatar was one of the easiest airlines to deal with for pet transport, and no one had any problems so far (there have been hundreds of Sri Lankan dogs transported with Qatar before this problem). The flight itself wasn't bad. We departed Colombo on time, staff were great during check in and checking my and my dog's documents was really easy - the manager was even excited to see my dog, and her and another staff member dedicated their time to me, in my own queue. The staff on the plane were nice too, both from Colombo-Doha and Doha-Amsterdam and assured me my dog was okay, even checking with the pilot to make sure the dog was on the flight and the pilot was aware of the dog. The flight itself was comfortable, good movie selections too. The only thing that bothered me was a lack of legroom on my Doha-Amsterdam flight, because the row in front of us had 4 seats and our row had 3 seats, leaving less space for me because of the seat in front of me. Me and the dog arrived safely and they even changed the dog's bedding during the layover, so I'm happy about that. If it wasn't for the nightmare of booking my dog onto the flight, it would've been great."

Decided to choose this carrier over other cheaper options due to oneWorld affiliation with Qantas, their reputation, their quality IFE, and ability to allocate our own seats without charge. Checkin was easy, although I hadn’t realised we could have used the Business Class counter with oneWorld Ruby status. Boarding is regimentally administered by zone. We chose the 2 abreast J/K seats on the A380 which requires walking the length of the main deck economy cabin the up the rear stairs. That small cabin at the rear of the upper deck was a good choice. Very quiet, and I like the extra storage space beside the K seat. We received a good blanket and pillow on both flights, plus a small amenity pack for the long overnight flight from SYD containing eyeshades, earplugs, sockettes, toothbrush and lip balm. Service was performed by the same crew member for the whole trip, same from Doha to Nice which I liked. The crew appeared very professional but our ladies were a little robotic. Food was adequate, with numerous drink and snack runs. I appreciated the attention to detail. Eg. asked for cranberry juice during one meal and when advised not available, was offered 3 other juice options which was fine by me. 10 minutes later, a cranberry juice was delivered. One annoying occurrence was when they changed us from 18K/19K to 19J/K from Doha, after we had been given boarding passes in Sydney. Not wanting a middle seat, the only alternative to a middle seat was an aisle further back. I think they fibbed telling us it was so a family could sit together. They weren’t in row 18. Just an entitled type of female in the K sea with J empty! Doha Airport is also an excellent transit hub. Modern, clean and uncrowded. I can see why QR are rated so highly."

I was wrong. With 8 passengers on first class and with a selection of 4 main course choices (3+1 vegetarian). Unfortunately the other 3 I really didn't like. Next at breakfast 4 choices again, so I thought scrambled eggs wouldn't be a problem. I was wrong again.

Sadly there was a bereavement in the immediate family which meant that I needed to push the flight bookings back by a week. Called to re-arrange flights and paid a re-booking fee. I requested a receipt for payment of re-booking fee (made over the phone) so I could claim on insurance. The email address they gave me was incorrect and it was quite a challenge trying to communicate with QR on this matter. On the day of travel, we arrived at the airport and were told that the booking had been canceled. We showed proof of payment, proof of payment of change of tickets. The staff at LHR were horrific in their attitude. My son, who is autistic became hugely distressed. Ended up having to buy another ticket 45 mins before departure (so now paid for the original ticket, change fee, and extortionate price at the airport for new tickets - almost 4x original ticket price handed over to QR). By the time we got to boarding gate my son was in such a state that LHR staff asked about calling a doctor to seek for medical assistance. Connection for DOH-HKT was missed so had to spend 1/2 day at DOH. Finally arrived at Phuket but the luggage had been mislaid. I have been trying to contact them since for compensation, and reimbursement but they are not responding to my emails. Horrific experience and the worst Customer Service I have had. The attitude of their staff to my son, who has Aspergers was shocking - quote ""can't he go home, does he live far from here?"".

I am a very nervous flier and the airline and the staff make all the difference. When booking Qatar airways was very decently priced and so I thought I would give them a go. So very pleased I did. Manchester - Doha I was given seat 37A - window exit seat. Which was VERY nice of the ground staff. They didn’t have to do this but I think the man could already see at check in that I was afraid. The seat was comfortable. I’m a fairly chubby lady, however I fit into the seat great and the seat belt and person next to me all was totally fine. The flight was a little bumpy but I was kept entertained by watching the cabin staff - watching them keep calm during turbulence stops me from being so scared. I didn’t eat during the flight as I find it too hard to eat during bumpy times as it worries me even more - silly I know, but. My passenger next to me however had a pack of pretzels soon as we took off, a chicken lunch around 1 hour after take off, then about 1 hour before arrival had a chicken pastry. There were drinks served at the same time. I had a gin - to calm nerves ;). Juice, water and Pepsi. Staff lovely. Had a lady from Ghana serving mostly. Arrived on time with smooth landing. Doha airport is massive  for those who have not ever been. Very nice ground staff at the gate. Doha to Auckland was even more bumpy. Constance low level turbulence with at times the seat belt signs coming on. Again on time landing despite leaving Doha around 20/30 mins late due to long take off queue at Doha (even at 2.30am). Breakfast was served about 1 hour after take off, then dinner around 5 hours. Snack box in between, a hot pastry in between and then  breakfast around 1 hour before arrival. I actually ate the second breakfast, I had the sausage and eggs. I ate the sausage but left the eggs and potatoes as not to my taste. Also had a coffee, orange juice, croissant, bag of apple slices and yogurt. Very good indeed. The flight attendant could see I wasn’t eating due to the bumpy conditions and kindly left me the snack box while I slept under my seat which had chocolate, granola bar, juice, pretzels etc. Furthermore, the flight attendants were absolutely lovely when I pressed the buzzer multiple times asking for water - again due to being afraid of flying I don’t like to stand up on flights. The cabin crew came around with boxes of popcorn / crisps during the flight as ‘movie snacks’. Such a nice touch!! Although i didn’t eat, the people next to me said the food was delicious. I can’t watch the tv whilst on the flight as I wear pressurising EarPods (I can’t hear anything at all). But the films were great; they had new films like dumbo live action & avengers endgame. Loads of games which I did play. As well as 1 hour free WiFi or WiFi for the whole flight for $10. Great connection much better than Emirates. For Emirates connection usually I can only access iMessage. However with Qatar I was able to go on Facebook, Snapchat and instagram with no issues at all. Probably on my flight home I will pay the $10 for my whole flight as it puts me at ease being able to talk to family and friends. Nice toiletries bag on the long flight with toothbrush, socks, eye mask, toothpaste and lip balm. The flight from U.K. to doha was 7 hrs while to Auckland was just over 16 hours. Which is VERY long and hard especially for a very very nervous flier. But Qatar cabin and ground staff were so lovely I felt so at ease & will be flying with them in the future."

For seat comfort and privacy, this is closer to First Class on several other airlines. For the DOH-CPH segment, the aircraft had the traditional Business Class seating. Even here, the Qatar Airways seat affords a great deal of comfort and space. Service levels were exceptional and the cabins spotless. My verdict: Qatar Airways Business Class is 'the best of the best.' The competition is not even close."

It couldn’t have been any better! Both flights with Qatar went absolutely seamless - but the travel experience was even something more than seamless - it was just perfect. The aircraft were new, neat and clean - it’s an unquestionable pleasure to travel on board the A350. IFE was very well equipped and the screens were surprisingly responsive - it was hardly impossible to get bored throughout the journey. Meal services were comprehensive and the dishes itself were mouth-watering. Another gem of Qatar is its crew - attentive, helpful, professional and chatty. Also Doha Hamad Airport is one of the best to have a stopover at - very well organised and easy to navigate. I can’t have any objections about this journey - exquisite in full measure!"

On boarding we were offered a drink [White Champagne or Rose], cold towel and menus. One of the staff then asked what we would like to order to eat and drink and when would we like to eat. The food comes direct to you from the galley - no rattling trolley service so if other people want to sleep, you can eat and not disturb your fellow travellers. The food was always excellent in heat and presentation. With this system you can order as much or as little as you want. If you do not wish to sleep, on the A380 at the back of business class there is The Bar which serves mocktails, cocktails and Champagne, juice and snacks There a sofa with seatbelts for sitting and magazines if you wish to read. I can only say the staff’s service was first rate for every flight. Being 6’2” and rather large, I found the lie flat bed is very comfortable and I could sleep without problem. "

However do to pricing factors for a business class ticket, I transferred my amazing American Express membership reward points to my QA account and credited it with miles. After having done that I called up the call centre who said there weren't any seats available for miles. I was disappointed as  I had already transferred my amex points out by then. As my date of travel arrived, departed Muscat to Doha on economy I had a 2.5 hr transit in doha and felt like trying my luck at the customer service counter.  Unfortunately my hope for an upgrade via miles was not entertained by the lady stating I was not eligible. Not giving up i was directed by another  staff to head to the counter where the security checks were. One staff typed away on his system started making calls and told me theres just one seat available which only could be released after confirmation from his team which would just one hour prior to departure. Keeping my fingers crossed 10 minutes later he told me I was able to avail the upgrade! The efforts made by Ahmed were so remarkable that I insisted I raise this to the management that staff like this should be admired and rewarded for such excellent service and should be role models. The gesture made such a difference to the whole trip as the Qsuite on the A350 is an amazing experience and I think it's a better than even the A380 business having the double bed feel side by side to your partner is wonderful. We've shared our experience with friends and family stating it's not just a 5 star service on board meeting the right staff gave us a 5 star service on ground too. "

Helsinki to Singapore via Doha Not my first time traveling with Qatar, I even wrote a great review to them last year. Now I think the management has change, or they are cutting costs a lot. Our first 6 hours flight to Doha was crowded, only 2 toilets for more than 150 people, the corridor was full all the time from people queuing to go to the toilet.  In previous opportunities, staff were more careful about this situation. Food the worse quality I got in a long flight, a chicken sandwich indian style and a breakfast plate with very weird eggs. Again, my experience in the past was way better. Doha to Singapore: Seats were comfortable, bigger plane, good entertainment, on time. Staff not service oriented, very bad faces when asking for water. Again that sandwich and breakfast plate with eggs. At this time me and my husband decided to avoid the food. As soon as we arrived in SG, we had digestive problems. I wrote to the airline, part of their answer was: ""We would like to take this opportunity to sincerely apologize for any inconvenience which may have been caused to you. While no reports similar in nature have been received from passengers who were served the same meal on the flight, we take reports such as yours with serious concern."" Apart from the food and staff in flight the rest is good, planes are modern, on time, bags arrived in good conditions, relatively comfortable seats for economy. "

Good value for money, but a bit neglected cabin. Inflight entertainment might be bit better, especially on A330 equipment where screens are old. I noticed the A330 had fewer lavatories. But what is absolutely the best when it comes to Qatar Airways are the meals and drinks. You have an outstanding choice of three main courses. Cold drinks served twice on ARN-DOH leg. And hot drinks also twice. Ability to select seats for free or ask (if you have a very short connection in Doha for example, to chose a front aisle seat). Boarding procedures were easy and simple. Both flights were on time and it is the most important thing. Ground service is awesome thanks to the Hamad Airport which is an ingenious facility designed around the passenger's very needs of any kind. Connectivity on board is, however, a bit behind competition."

Almost everything was the best of the best! I was also lucky enough to be able to fly Qsuite, which is easily the best way to travel. Check in at Bangkok Airport is quite a mess, due to the fact that there are four flights leaving simultaneously to Doha. The check in agent said that the Qatar Airways lounge in Bangkok is closed due to a cracked window. I was about to head to the JAL lounge when I noticed that the Qatar lounge was in fact, open and fully operational. This lounge was absolutely immaculate. They even had Bollinger champagne! There was a buffet service and most drinks were actually made on request to the staff. They were there to help you with everything. I think the staff to passenger ratio was 1:1. My favourite thing at this lounge has to be the Baklava. Qatar also has their lounge literally next door to their main competition, Singapore Airlines. Boarding was orderly on the outbound flights from Bangkok to Doha and Johannesburg, but on the return they instead asked economy passengers to board first, their reason being ""The cabin was not ready for business class passengers."" The good bits: Qsuite! We were a family of four, so we elected to have the first ""Quad"" seat which is essentially a conference room with closed doors! We were in our own private world up there. The seat/bed was super comfortable, although watch out for row two, as this row has slightly less foot space due to the angle of the cabin. There was a thin mattress cover provided and my mum and dad were even able to sleep together in the double bed! The regular 1-2-1 business class found on the A350 and B787 was also excellent. I would strongly suggest reserving row 7 on the A350, as you get two extra cubbies next to you for your belongings. Also located close but not too close to the toilets. The flat bed on these seats were also excellent, and there were endless seat adjustments. the ""bar"" on these planes was filled with snacks, fruit and champagne and most of the time there was a flight attendant waiting there to assist you. The service: I cannot emphasise this more, it surpassed all expectations I had set. Every single item was placed at your seat, no trays were used at all. The flight attendants were all friendly and professional. They seem to know the types of passengers very well and how to treat them. I had a cold on my return trip, and was constantly looked after. On one of the flights, a medical emergency was declared and the crew handled the situation very calmly and professionally. Once the flight landed there was already an ambulance waiting for the sick passenger. The food: Everything I tasted was excellent, and I took advantage of their dine on demand service by ordering a hot snack in the middle of the flight. I think my favourite meal was a Philly Cheesesteak which was very filling and the beef was very tender. They give every passenger (Including economy) 1 hour free wifi onboard! The Al Mourjan lounge in Doha: To call it huge is an understatement. This lounge is absolutely gigantic! You also had a personal tablet at every seat for information on the airport or flight information. Too bad everything is too spaced out. Given the fact that all airlines have their ups and downs, I would say that Qatar is an excellent airline and it shows in almost every way. I would certainly choose them because of their extensive network, but they haven't won me completely over. Yet I'd give them a 11 if i could!"

The touchscreen responded slowly. Also, the meal was not served per my pre-selection.  The flight from Doha to BKK was 3.5 hrs delayed without any reasons provided. The airline did provide the complimentary meal; however, the quality was unacceptable to me. The airline needs to understand more about nutrition for ""diabetic meal"". It's not just a healthy, low-fat, low sodium meal. They served low GI fruit which is not for diabetic people. However, the cabin crew provided the good services and took good care of customers on board. Also, I observed the ground hostesses were ready to take care of passengers transitting to other locations. "

With it being a very long flight, and having done these flights in the past with regular seat, I wanted to make sure this flight could be more comfortable. I get to my seat number at boarding, to find that it’s a regular window seat, with no space at all. When I asked crew members why my booked seat isn’t available, they said it’s because the aircraft was changed from what was on my booking. On top of this, crew members were rude, unattentative, and blocked people in the toilets by leaving trolleys in front of the door. They seemed  under qualified, no confidence, often missed people out when serving drinks/food. Lots of people angry with the service. "

Alas, the service in between was minimal. A light breakfast was served before landing. Overall, this puts Qatar among the best carriers, but I will no longer fly with them as their flight schedule between southeast Asia and Europe is not appropriate.

There was no queue and complete in 5 minutes. I was given my boarding pass and advised to use for it for the fast track and Lounge. I headed to the lounge where I was greeted by a member of staff who seemed awkward. I was the first to arrive and i think caught them off guard. Quickly from a side door appeared a chap arranging his tie and who welcomed me, taking my boarding pass and scanning it. I soon realised the first person to greet me was a lounge attendant and was perhaps a little embarrassed that the reception chap was not ready. I enjoyed the breakfast and relaxed for a while until boarding was ready. I was welcomed and shown to my seat where the crew offered to put my bag in the overhead locker. I was then left for a few minutes to settle in before crew returned and offered a welcome drink. As it was a holiday, at 07.30 i went for Champagne! Menu was then Brought around before a short time later crew came and discussed when would like to eat. Qatar offer dine on demand so you eat when you want but they check with you your initial intentions which i think is great. Departure from LHR was delayed which meant an very quick connection in Doha where the flight was boarding when i arrived. DOH is smooth. On arrival there was a lady calling out for Bangkok who duly wrote the gate number on my boarding pass and advised to proceed to the gate. Doha to Bangkok was a late flight so i slept and arrived in to BKK fresh. My return to LHR was two weeks or so later. BKK was again a day flight. I would say they need more staff at check in at Suvarnabhumi. There were 2 counters business class side but that also included economy bag drop. There were 2 couples ahead of me and a queue for bag drop but business class trumped the bag drop people which was a respectable touch. It took about 15 minutes compared to LHR 5 mins. Again service on QSuite was great. Drink, menu, chocolates. Staff friendly and will chat. I often feel crew just go through then motions but actually on Qatar if you engage them they will happily chat. I spoke to some about where they were from, being based in Doha, stopover etc. It seems most only have about 24 hours once they arrive where they land - greulling. Flight from DOH to LHR was lacklustre. Boarding was chaotic. everyone moves forward, economy class not listening to their instructions to wait for their zone to be called. Initially only one staff scanning boarding passes who had to keep shouting Business class passengers only. Anyway once on board it started well. Drink brought, towel, menu. Order taken after take off which was fine, but they let themselves down by being the slowest service i have ever ever had. I had anticipated a quick bite to eat before getting a sleep in as i had to drive home on arrival -2 hours. We took off at 15.50 and i had'nt finished eating over halfway through the flight. Wine and nuts came - great i thought. It took 20 minutes for the amouse bouche to follow. Then when he came to clear I thought the soup would follow shortly. I was wrong. It took about another 15 minutes. It was all very slow and with my frustration clear, when I said I wish to sleep he said he would give me make the bed and gave me a set of pyjamas to change into. PJ not handed out as standard on an afternoon flight."

This is not normal. When I asked I was told ""Sir I am just doing my job"". I am asking why I was having additional security screening and i was told it was because I checked in online. I was told I was asked all those security questions and held up at the boarding gate because I choose to check in online and print out my boarding pass at home rather than standing in line at the check in counter and having my boarding pass printed there. I know they check passports at the gate, that was not my question, I wanted to know why i was asked all those questions at the gate. That just only happens when you have been selected for Secondary Security Screening. But he refused to say that and instead of offering even a half-hearted apology. They did not open priority boarding for me a Silver member and my 6 year-old daughter. But never addressed that after i complained.

The OryxOne Inflight Entertainment System was excellent and offered a lot of great movies and TV Shows!

It was a good chicken pizza sandwich, not the dry chicken sandwiches they used to serve.

Few hours later , they served breakfast, I ordered a special Hindu Meal request, It was delicious, at least better than the normal meal they serve. ;) That wasn’t my first time flying Qatar Airways, but I really have to say Qatar Airways has Improved a lot since my last flight with them almost 9 months ago.

We booked our flight Melbourne-Milan on 14 August 2018. We have called up to confirm a bassinet seat multiple times as recent as two days ago and bassinet seats were confirmed and allocated. At check-in we were informed that our seats had been re-assigned and there were no bassinets available and to speak to the manager on the help desk. They said there was nothing they could do as there was 14 infants booked on the flight and only 8 bassinets. We offered to pay to upgrade as there were bassinet seats available in business class but this was not an option according to the Melbourne team. We called the Qatar reservations while waiting at the counter and were informed that our confirmed seat in the system was a bassinet and they shouldn't have been re-allocated. They said they would be able to provide an upgrade to business but the phone was passed to the team in Melbourne and they dismissed his request to assist us. The most senior person at the counter tried his best to help and arranged for our bags to be pulled of the flight and moved the flight to the next day. How can an airline have a policy to ensure that despite your customer doing everything possible you are not offered the seat which you had booked and confirmed?

The next flight was 7 hours later, which ruined my travel plans. It was in the middle of the night and all we got offered was a voucher for a restaurant : no offer for a room to have a rest. I was forced to try and sleep in one of the Quiet rooms with pretty uncomfortable lounges and announcements every 10 minutes. They show these connecting flights but there's no effort to guarantee a connection that would only require a small delay for the second flight. Flights were quite good, but this sort of behavior ruined the experience."

I have flown with Qatar several times and I am a loyalty club member on Silver status. Unfortunately for work we are only allowed to fly economy so I like to fly with the best economy flight I can. Qatar fell way behind in the quality on my latest journey to Australia with their handling of situations which occurred. The flight from LHR was delayed slightly with a short layover of only 45 minutes. We were assured that everything would be done to get us there with enough time. We arrived in Doha with 35 mins to spare and waited to disembark for about 15 mins. During this time the business and first passengers were called to leave to transfer on. Our flight to Sydney was still in the airport. As we left there was a lady waiting with hotel/meal vouchers which had obviously been prepared during our flight.  We had to wait until the following morning meaning a terrible night in a noisy hotel.  Qatar have paid me for the delay, although it did take 2 emails and quoting the EC regulations before it happened."

J Heale",,10th June 2019,Business,Economy Class,Sydney to London via Doha,April 2019,,,,,1.0,,1,no,1,"  I have flown Qatar Airways several times in the last year and am a member of their loyalty program (silver). Unfortunately my last trip to Australia was absolutely awful. Delays leaving London meant a night spent in Doha but the way back was worse.  I arrived in Sydney airport with 3hrs to spare before the last night flight. There were already about 100 people waiting. Then the flight coming in was announced as cancelled. After much confusion and waiting about 20 minutes it was then changed to our flight. It turned out the incoming had been diverted to Perth with a fault to the toilet and remained in Perth because it would have been to late to arrive in Sydney. This was information not shared with us by Qatar. They sent out one person to try and talk to all passengers and most people couldn’t hear him. He was getting very cross that he had to keep repeating himself. We then had to queue up to be told which hotel we were in - either the airport hotel or one back in the city centre. We queued for about and hour and a half as there were only a few people behind the counters to deal with the entire flight. They did supply a bottle of water/juice and some crackers. I was put in the city centre hotel and told to wait for a phone call or email telling me which flight I was to be put on. I endured a fairly sleepless night, waiting for the update from Qatar. In the end it was only by checking my app at breakfast that I discovered I was booked on a different airline which would take me via China and take over 30 hrs to get home. As you can imagine, I wasn’t best pleased by this and when someone then phoned me (about 30 mins later), I pleaded with them to get me a different route but they weren’t very sympathetic. I cadged a lift with a couple flying to Scotland who had managed to get on a flight with Qatar and went to the Qatar office to plead with them without luck. They did give me a food voucher and told me to go to the counter when the lunch time flight was leaving in the hope that some people had cancelled and I could get on, again with no luck. I remained airport side for most of the day trying to plead  to get me home earlier and quicker. At no point was I offered a different airport, e.g. Gatwick. To be fair the flights into London were very busy and I think this was the main issue with people going to the UK. I had to come back via China Southern Airlines and it was the worst experience I have had. I arrived home late Sunday evening and didn’t work the following day as I was exhausted. So I lost a days work and a weekend with my family. Qatar will not compensate me as EC regulations don’t apply and will not give me back my loyalty points I would have earned if I had flown Qatar Airways."

This time I decided to take my family with a short stop over via Doha in order to save SGD3000 versus direct flight. We are a family of 4 travelling together on the way to Paris and returning on separate dates from London. I had to make three separate bookings as a consequence. I realised after making the booking it was not possible to fly together (as 3 bookings) and had to insist at the airport to be seated together. When checking online I was offered to pay 1200SGD extra for Business class upgrade which I did. I then realised the upgrade was only for one leg of the flight (Doha to Paris) and not for the entire journey. Then impossible to cancel online or by phone or to go back to the original booking and impossible to pay for the upgrade for the whole family - not available. Also cannot get a refund for the upgrade that is non refundable. The plane was slightly delayed with no explanation.  We arrived with 20 minutes delay in Doha with 55 minutes to catch the connection flight to Paris. The plane parked far away from the terminal and we endured a 10-15 minutes bus ride. Nobody was waiting for us at the transfer area and we got to the gate 15 minutes before the departure time. The Gate was closed and at 1am we struggled to find a customer service representative. We got our flight rebooked for the morning flight 8 hours later and  we were left alone at 1:30am in the terminal. They did not offer any hotel, impossible to access the business lounge and  we finally found a lounge full of families waiting for the morning flight.  At the end I wanted to save a bit of money by suffering a 1 hour stop over in Doha and ended up paying the same amount wasting 10 hours with my family complaining."

Frank Hewett",,3rd June 2019,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Goa to London via Doha,May 2019,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,,4,yes,10,"  Goa to London via Doha. One needs to give credit when credit is due I've always said. I've flown with Qatar Airways on and off over the years, whether it be from UK to India, India to Australia or UK to Australia. I've also flown with  other airlines all over the world and over many years. Fortunately I don't do three flights a week anymore and it's only a handful of long hauls a year now. But every time I've flown with Qatar Airways it's been a very pleasant experience. The  staff are by far the best I've dealt with for politeness and fantastic customer service. The flight details I listed above on 30th May QR523 and QR007 from Goa to London, where my 11 year old son, Frank Hewett, travelled as an unaccompanied minor, I felt so at ease with the service Qatar Airways provided. From the time they collected Frank and delivered him to my wife in London I was kept up to date on the progress and even the phone calls to let me know he had lost his mobile phone in the airport lounge. Little be known to me, Qatar Airways  upgraded him to business class from Goa to Doha. I honestly thank Qatar Airways and the staff for looking after my son and gave me the peace of mind knowing he was completely looked after from start to finish."

The check-in at Dublin rigidly enforce the  7kg cabin bag limit. This would be fair enough except that on my outbound journey staff had told me that Qatar Airways baggage allowance was 10kg, and I kind of relied on that advice. On board the 787 I was disappointed to find my foot space restricted by a big metal box under the seat, despite being a near-new aircraft. I got a vegetarian meal, but not the one I ordered - I think that went to my neighbour who didn't eat it. Qatar doesn't put names or seat numbers on special meals. We were a little late into Doha, but the delay was compounded when the aircraft parked a 20 minute bus ride away from the terminal. Security identified an issue with my hand luggage and made me unpack everything. Finally re-packed, I started the long walk to the new gate, only to have the security experience repeated - even though I quickly volunteered the small device which had caused issues at the previous check, they made me unpack everything, again. On board the A380 I have to say things took a big turn for the better, seats were comfortable, no metal boxes under the seats, I got the right meal and managed some sleep. Arrival in Perth was on time and luggage came quickly. I never did manage to get internet connectivity on the 787; I did on the A380, but be aware that the complimentary wifi they advertise is actually restricted to certain social media. So it was a mixed experience - I would fly Qatar again, but I think I would try to avoid the 787, transfer times under 2 hours, and Dublin."

Despite the long flight duration, it was a truly comfortable journey for me and my family. The seats and on-board services from the staffs were excellent. The foods were by far the best in-flight meals that I ever had. I was impressed of how Qatar prioritise child passenger and how the staffs interact with kid so sincerely. Transit in Doha was OK, nice airport but not many options for foods. But it was OK because the flight service gave us everything that we need. The only disappointment was the ground staff in Sydney airport. We were denied check in the flight to Paris because I had a Schengen visa issued by Switzerland. But the manager in-charged sorted it."

One of the best Economy flights I have experienced. The seat is really comfortable and comes with all the perks: toiletries kit, socks, refresher, pillow etc. The elbow support on the alley side can be put to vertical position which is very convenient for oversized people. The space for your legs is most likely the widest of all airlines, even if the front seat is reclined you don't feel cramped at all. The staff is very professional, reactive and empathic towards the passengers. The toilets are large, clean and well designed. Food is good, entertainment system is nice with lots to keep you busy in long hauls. All in all, I will fly this airline again anytime. The stopover in Doha is fantastic as this is a very nice and well-thought airport with lots to entertain you. On the return flight, the connection was extremely tight (1 hour) and yet it was smooth and we got all our luggage on arrival. Thank you folks, keep up the great job."

Upon seeing there was another staff manning a counter on the left with no queue, I went to her mistakenly thinking it was just another line for boarding. When I presented my boarding pass, she didn't bother to take it and said something which I couldn't understand. I decided to go ahead to walk towards the boarding gate. The lady raised her voice and said 'hey!', which started me and then said the counter was for business class. I acknowledge that I'd made a mistake but she could have pointed me to the correct queue instead of mumbling with no action. The crew on the plane was pleasant and friendly."

My outbound flight was from Singapore to Oslo via Doha. The transfer at Doha was a rush because the flight from Singapore was delayed. I had to board a bus to get to the terminal, go through security screening and run across the terminal to the boarding gate to catch another bus for the connecting flight. They failed to transfer my check-in luggage at Doha. I arrived in Oslo at about 1.30pm and reported that my luggage was missing. The ground handling (SAS) representative told me that my luggage was  in Doha and that it would arrive the next day. It did not arrive the next day. I tried calling their representative at the airport, but I could not reach them.  No one from Qatar Airways or SAS called me, even though they have details of my hotel and phone number. Eventually, my luggage was delivered to my hotel 55 hrs after I arrived in Oslo. I have written emails to the airline to ask how I can claim compensation, but each time I only received a reply saying that the matter is being handled by their airport counterparts and to wait for these airport personnel to reply. It has been 17 days since the incident, and there has been no word from these people. "

Biz class product mixed with both QSuite on A359 and old seat on B773 but high level of comfort in both cases with food quality top notch. I have to say that despite the new suite is newer and innovative is a bit claustrophobic , the old style seat itself is more comfortable to sleep in and move around.Transit in DOH was smooth and will recommend this airport compared to DXB that is too crowded. Al Mourjan Business Lounge in DOH was better than any other airline's F class lounge. Crews quality standard are at top standards in the market and set this airline far from the direct competitor EK. I'll fly with Qatar again in the future even paying a premium price compared to Emirates, Oman Air or Etihad."

Service on the both legs outstanding as always. Unfortunately, my baggage didn’t make it to Stockholm, and I was promised to have it delivered to my home within a day. That’s where the nightmare started. I had a connecting flight to Hamburg, and was informed a day later that they were not willing to deliver to my home. I have to collect the baggage from Hamburg airport. Since it’s a long way from my home to Hamburg, I have not been able to collect the bag yet and it’s day 5 after arrival. I think the airlines should take full responsibility if baggage is lost. No response to my emails....the same applies to phone calls...where I was told that reservation got nothing to do with it. The handling agent insists that I collect the baggage myself. A rather disappointing experience for a Qatar Platinum status guest."

Ground service in Bangkok was mixed, check in and security were fine and very quick. Disappointed that the nice ticket wallets seem to no longer be issued (I wondered if it was a glitch on my outbound).. hardly necessary but was a nice touch. The lounge showers were not working. Thankfully I knew I could use the JAL lounge which was close by, but this was not offered by the staff when I made clear my disappointment at theirs not functioning. Other than that the lounge was excellent. Premium feeling but lovely food and drink options, very attentive professional staff and a nice mix of comfy and practical seating. Annoyingly the lounge was absolutely no where near the gate they were using tonight, approx 20 min walk. Whilst you expect this at the airlines hub airport, you do not expect it when at another world airport. With only a handful of flights a day and a dedicated lounge it should be possible to fly from gates at least on the same side of the airport. When eventually getting to the gate, having been prompted by lounge staff that the plane was boarding, all bus passenger had to stand for another 15 mins before they actually started boarding as the gate was so packed full there were no seats. Lounge in Doha is cavernous. Having visited a few times now I have decided that overall I don’t like it, and as Qatar airways expands and the lounge gets busier I like it less and less. Because it is just open space it always feels busy. The chairs are not particularly comfortable and there are coffee/soft drinks stands dotted about fairly sparsely, with main food and drink at either end. Obviously there are staff walking around who can provide you drinks, but I prefer more self service drinks to also be available. On board the service was excellent on both flights. Wonderful crew, and good quality food and drinks. Seats are very comfortable. On the 777 it was the old seat, although I actually really like this. It’s not quite fully flat but still very nice with excellent storage and I slept well. IFE is fine. Lots of choice and good resolution however the interface is clunky and unresponsive on both systems. The new one on Qsuite is much better. Landing in Gatwick reminds me that in spite of a lot of improvements Gatwick is still a horrible airport.. but it is convenient for me. Bags arrived quickly and immigration had a short queue. Overall flight was excellent although very slight downgrades in quality, and price increases are making this not quite as appealing for leisure travellers. Being Oneworld is a massive perk as tier point collection for BA is very good."

My wife and I have just completed 4 flights with Qatar Airways. Travelling to London from Melbourne via Doha and return. The first thing we noticed was the extended boarding time on the A380 which ensured orderly and relaxed boarding with no pushing and shoving and fighting for overhead bin space. The inflight service on 3 of the 4 flights was the best we have ever had in economy class. The service on the second flight while not in the same class as the other 3 flights was certainly as good as our regular carrier SQ so to complain would be pedantic. The choice of 3 options of meal (1 of which is vegetarian) at meal times was a pleasant addition and all meals I ate on all flights were full flavoured generous in size healthy and a step above the mush some airlines offer. Plenty of snacks and beverages offered throughout the flight. In short food and beverage is plentiful and with the extended choice of options should satisfy most passengers. Seat comfort (we had 3 A380 flights and 1 B787) was terrific enough legroom and width, the A380 was a little more generous and much quieter in the cabin than the B787. In fact the A380 certainly was the clear winner between both plane variants. The inflight entertainment system Oryx 1 was superb and offered a great selection of movies from new releases through to classics from the golden years of Hollywood, Music selection was the best I have encountered on an inflight entertainment system and I listened to a fair few full length albums to while away the time. Finally big shout out to the excellent Qatar flight crews who were professional, exuberant and hardworking with no crew vanishing acts here like most long hauls where you struggle to find crew after the first main meal service. In fact my wife mentioned as we were at the baggage carousel at Tullamarine, that it was the freshest she had ever felt after a long haul flight home, given we did London Doha (6.5 hours) 3 hours in the Oryx Lounge at Doha, then Doha To Melbourne (13.5 hours) . Qatar Airways have now won my long haul business. Unfortunately with no direct Melbourne Singapore or Melbourne Vietnam services I am still shackled to SQ whose standards have been slipping for the last 3 years. Thank you Qatar see you again in September when I test drive your new Lisbon route."

Normally I love Qatar Airways but this experience wasn't so good. When I flew LHR to JNB via DOH everything was great. The brilliant service, plenty of food, great entertainment system and nice aircraft. The way back was not as good. The check-in assistant at JNB was incredibly rude as he spoke to his colleague the whole time he was checking me in and looked at me in a contemptuous way. I suspect he might be employed by the airport as I had the same experience at passport control and security. The route JNB - DOH was ok. The plane was nice and spacious and the seats were very comfortable. A female passenger moved next to me because the passenger behind her had placed her bare feet in full view on the first passenger's armrest. No one told her to put her feet away. They ran out of beef and chicken dishes and only had vegetarian left which I refused to eat as it was dal and spinach which seemed like a bad choice for a flight. The attendants tried really hard to find alternatives and credit to them for their efforts and professionalism. The airline needs to review its meal quotas for each flight. The route DOH - LGW was cramped and uncomfortable - the seats didn't go back as far. The snack was a choice of pizza or pizza with chicken. I don't eat cheese but luckily a member of the cabin crew found me something else. Staff were also great on this flight. The onboard WIFI is terrible. On two separate flights I signed up for the one hour free. The WIFI wouldn't connect until the hour was up, at which point it told me free WIFI was no longer an option. On the other two flights it worked ok but had periods where it wouldn't connect. Compared to Emirates, Qatar Airways staff are friendlier and more obliging and they give you more food.  If all Qatar Airway's planes were as good as the JNB-DOH route and they didn't run out of food then they would definitely be my favourite airline."

I noticed some decline in the standard of their business class product over the last year or so. Qatars big strength was always its consistency of their business class. That is not the case anymore. The flight from Stockholm to Doha was top notch service wise, but the flight to Singapore was a different matter. The Qsuite was great as always, but service wasn’t. The Purser in charge never introduced herself or said goodbye, nothing. The lady in charge of my section was obviously hating her job. No smile, very slow and chaotic service, wine was served after the main course. My seat could not move 2h before arrival and I had to sit on the bed for breakfast. When the plane started to descend, I was still sitting and my third reminder to look at the seat was ignored by her. I asked someone else and within 5 minutes I was given another seat for landing. Overall a rather disappointing flight, I hope my return next week will be better."

On balance this was a good experience, not great. BCN-DOH on an A350 that apparently is owned by Latam and operated by Qatar. Branding was Qatar, but business class configuration was pure Latam - ie 2x2x2 - hence when they asked for in excess of 700 Euro to upgrade for a 6.5 hour flight I passed. Economy was pleasant as the flight wasn't crowded and I had three seats to myself. I did opt to upgrade on the DOH-BOM segment, as it was a Q-suite configured aircraft, and priced at just over 300 euro for a late night three hour flight arriving at 2:30am. India flights all running full post Jet Airways collapse so I thought it smart to upgrade. The Q-suite product is very good, although I found the suite a bit claustrophobic. Service was good. There's a bit of a cool demeanor with their cabin crews. Zero special treatment or recognition for Oneworld Emerald for seat allocation or onboard. The Doha lounge was overrated and almost appalling for me. In summary, the trip was good, not spectacular. "

P Neal",Boeing 777,28th April 2019,Business,Economy Class,Washington to Bangkok via Doha,April 2019,5.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,5,yes,6,"  Washington to Bangkok in economy class on a 777. I arrived 70 minutes before the flight, leaving 10 minutes to spare before the official cutoff time. There were three ticket agents and no one else in line. However, there apparently was some debate over who would have to serve me, as no one would check me in. Several times a clock behind the counter was pointed to, and the agents wandered off without acknowledging me. Finally a supervisor asked one of the agents to take care of me. The agent again pointed to the clock (which at this point was still about 7 minutes prior to the cutoff) but the supervisor pointed to the work station and finally I was attended to. On board, the flight crew seemed neglectful, we were pushing back during the safety presentation and there were passengers standing in the aisles.  The  inflight experience was fine. The seats were comfortable, legroom was adequate, and the cabin was clean, and even economy class gets an amenity kit. The meals were the highlight, with multiple cuisines on offer. An hour of free wifi is included for anyone who pays enough attention to read these things, and the connection speed was truly exceptional. The only complaint about the inflight experience was the headphone jack. If you want to use your own headset, bring a two pronged adapter, or you'll suffer through the adequate but not much-more-than-that headset provided. My second flight was 10 hours after my first, and the Doha Airport is a tragic experience unless you have, or pay for lounge access. or you have a desire to shop for high end luxury brands of clothing and luggage.  The connecting flight was just like the first, but with no seat charging options.  A bit surprising to not have that option, but the entertainment system was good enough to keep me amused. All in, this was better than my last few experiences on Qatar, and I wouldn't tell friends to avoid them. Just get there earlier than the cutoff, and bring a battery and a headphone adapter."

Having had to fly Qantas to get to Sydney and vice versa Business class it makes you realise how poor our own Qantas airline is. The cabin crew on Qatar know how to serve (thats a word lacking in our countries airline) they were tireless in there quest to serve great meals and wine and ensure we were well looked after. Pity they do not fly to Brisbane which would avoid the sub standard Q we have to use. Well done Qatar you're great.

The Airbus A350-1000 is the latest addition to Qatar Airways' fleet, with its Q Suites that have been raved as the best business class product in the world. In my opinion, it is indeed the best business class product I experienced to date. First and Business Class passengers had their own vast premium check-in area and, not a separate line but a separate security screening facility, which made the whole process peaceful and seamless. The lounge at Doha airport was huge and beautiful. It was quite crowded when I came as it took me a while to find a dining table. However, it did not seem like a chronic issue as it was cleared shortly after. Food offerings were OK, not inspiring providing this was their home base. The gate area, though, was tight and crowded, but I think that was more about the airport. However, as QR is the main operator of the airport, I am surprised why they do not exercise their influence on the design of the gate, which has just been recently completed, to match their excellent service. My Q Suite, in my opinion, was the most intelligently designed business class seat I have seen (those included AA, DL, UA, CX, CI, JL, RJ, BR, TK, BA, OZ, VN, KE, GA and more). The suite may have appeared a bit claustrophobic with the door closed, but it felt totally different with generous shoulder room and hip room, which made sleeping so easy and comfortable. QR offered pajamas and turn down service, a first class perk. Cabin service and food were excellent, and meals were presented nicely, a la carte and on demand. I really enjoyed the flight."

Extremely orderly boarding process followed by informative captains announcement. One gripe on this leg was the aircraft was on the colder side with no blanket! They had a few and was handed out for people who requested them. The food was good and the flight attendants were as always very attentive. On landing though we had to take a bus from the aircraft to the terminal. This caused a lot of people to panic and run to their connections. I had a two hour layover but had just enough time to make it to my gate. The second leg was a longer flight - this time the aircraft was newer and the seat back entertainment system was of higher quality. Meal service was good and timely. They served two main meals with a snack in the middle. As always the flight attendants were very attentive. Unusually they ran short of the lamb option! As for the seat - my seat was very uncomfortable. It was behind an exit row. Both the seat anchor from the front seat and the seat back entertainment system took away a major portion of the foot space. Had to find an angle to sit for the whole 12 hour journey. On arrival it took nearly an hour to retrieve bags - which is understandable. The takeoff/landing and pilot announcements were all extremely good!

The seat width leaves much to be desired. No position allowed me to sit without rubbing elbow on the armrest. One cannot also use the neck pillow effectively in these seats as the new fangled head rest interferes.Again very attentive service.

She took out a mechanical contraption, placed my card on it and over it a multiple sheets credit card slip and then pulled a slide over them to get the imprint.

To make matters worse - when I boarded the aircraft and saw this business class cabin I told the cabin chief that I expected QSuites and he began arguing that this flight doesn’t have QSuites - a few minutes later I was told that this was a mistake and that the aircraft was changed.

Overall a pleasant experience across the four sectors flown with only one delay of less than 30 minutes due to a passenger feeling unwell. The BHX-DOH sectors were on a B787, which was probably starting to show its age. For example the AVOD system on these planes is not as sleek as on the B777 which were used for the DOH-MNL sectors, however both provided a good selection of movies both new and old, TV shows, music and games. Seats are generally comfortable although the box for the AVOD system cuts into legroom if you are seated by the aisle or window. The recline is good on both planes as the lower portion of the seat moves forward slightly as the back portion reclines, giving slightly more recline overall. The quality of the food was generally excellent across all sectors, however I was disappointed that on three of the four sectors my first choice was unavailable by the time I was served. On one occasion the air stewardess did make up for this slightly by offering me a crew meal which was similar, however it would be better if the meal choices were available to more of the passengers. Drinks were available throughout the flights although in between meal service you need to go to the galley and ask. We were provided with an amenity kit on the DOH-MNL sectors which included an eye mask, travel socks, toothpaste, toothbrush and lip balm. Free Wi-Fi was available for a limited time on all sectors although the speed on the DOH-MNL sectors was much better - again this might be due to the age of the aircraft. USB ports were available on both planes to charge devices. For the price I paid I was very happy with the service provided and would definitely use Qatar Airways again."

They don’t penalise travellers with saver tickets with reduced luggage allowance or charge extra for bulkhead seats or charge for popcorn. Cabin staff excelled and even inquired of my daughter how her trip was going . Keep up this level of service Qatar Airways.

Fantastic new airplane and the Qsuites are very nice, give you much privacy. Big tv screen and properly choice of movies. I think it could have been more space for your feet, when you make a bed out of your chair. This was an evening flight, duration 8 hours. The crew were very slow, and almost two hours to serve food, and i got only half of my order. Then it was not much time left for sleeping."

London to Doha A380, 9 am flight on time from Heathrow, an aisle seat with leg room. Flight comfortable and breakfast served. Doha to Lahore Boeing 777 not a new aircraft and fully booked. Again an aisle seat with hard cushion and less leg room. Meal served somewhat uninspiring, but cabin crew efficient as always. Arrived in Lahore on time. Return flight from Karachi to Doha - very early departure (3 am) but check in etc still quick and we left on time-aircraft airbus A350, relatively new and more spacious than the 777. Seats comfortable and enough leg room - I am over 6' tall-leg room is important. Before take off passenger in the seat in front of me was sick, cabin crew quickly provided sick bags and a more senior cabin crew member questioned her about her medication. We took off but the passenger and her son were moved elsewhere in the plane. Crew handled the situation well and other passengers were moved to the seats as the plane was full. Breakfast was served but was very ordinary."

The best bit is trying to complain. Basically you can’t. And customer services eventually got rude and impatient with me. I score them low on an overall experience, excellent onboard though but pray you don’t need to contact them.

My connection time from Doha to Vienna was quite long as 8hr 15mins, which was expected when I bought my ticket. I was fine with it. As I reached Doha at 2335 hrs, I was unable to do anything at the airport. Although the connection time was more than 8hrs, no meal vouchers were provided by the airline. At around 0700hrs, guests were informed that there will be a delay and the next information will be released by 0945 - nothing was given to us. They just gave 1 announcement regarding this issue and mentioned that it is a technical problem. I understand the technical problem can be unpredictable but I would expect more explanation and more care."

Booked my flights almost 2 months ahead, received an email a month later saying I need to call Customer service there was a change to the flight. I call customer service after an hour wasted on the phone they tell me all is fine and fixed. Time to check in for flight 24 hrs before flight and check in doesn't work. Arrive at airport checking in to Porter Air, they tell me my flights are being deleted and I need to call Qatar. Finally, Air Canada reaches me and for some reason I was moved from Porter which I booked, and now was placed on Air Canada (a company I try to avoid). I contact customer service once in Thailand on my trip to inquire about the screw up. They tell me all is fine and this was not an issue. I try to check in before flight going home, can't check in. Can't contact Qatar, their phone number is in Doha and I am not paying to call them for poor service. Arrive at airport 2hrs and 20min before flight. Huge lineup for Qatar Airways with only two economy counters open. Also a line for web check-in drop off bags - which would have been great had Qatar allowed me to check in online. Beyond disappointed with this awful experience. "

The customer service personnel at Hamad Int'l airport were very helpful, professional and kind. At first I was going to be charged for the change in flight, but when I explained the situation, Qatar Airways understood and did not charge me a cent (especially thankful after a long flight and being very tired). That is first class service. Thank you to Qatar Airways for this help. A recommendation to be considered, any changes in airport policies or procedures (new or from old practices), it would be great if an email is sent to all who purchased the tickets, I don't think this would be very costly to the Qatar Airways and it would highly appreciated. Example: Hamad Int'l airport is a silent airport, I did not know that until I faced this issue. Please put notice on the screen if the time is departure or boarding time. Thanks again from a very happy customer. "

QR did not have pre-dinner drinks service, only with food. However, staff happily served us drinks when we press attendants' bell. Seats are decent for sitting, not so comfortable for sleeping in. QR provided an overnight pack that contained toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, mask and lip balm. There were also charging sockets and a good selection of Hollywood and World movies. Skipped dinner but breakfast was decent. Overall, a good flight for economy class."

On this flight we had the QSuite configuration. The seat hardware blows away all the competition. The comfort and space is closer to the First Class seating found on many other airlines. I haven't seen Singapore or Cathay Business in recent years (Qatar's closest competition) but I don't think either has anything like the seats of QSuite. Even the lavatory design is outstanding. Qatar's in-flight service is very good, but I would rank Lufthansa, Swiss and ANA a notch higher in this department. Where Qatar fell short is at the Al Mourjan Business Lounge in Doha. Physically it is an impressive space. However, during the morning peak hour it transforms into a bus station with all the unpleasantness that goes with it. It is surprising that Qatar hasn't thought through this as well as the energies they have put into their in-flight product. We had to stand outside for 15 mins for a shower and the restaurant upstairs was packed to the gills with many turned away due to lack of seating space."

This time my flights were a mixed bag and somewhat disappointing, especially the sectors BLR-DOH and DOH-CPH on 09 January 2019. Both flights full, the first leg being a real flight from hell because of screaming children who wouldn't stop during the 4 hr flight. QR has added an extra seat on their B777-200LR's as well as B777-300ER's during their latest refurbishment (3-4-3 in Economy), which makes the seating extremely cramped and the aisles too narrow. I'm 6""1' and due to the too narrow seat, it was very hard to find a comfortable position to eat or rest, the seat is simply not suitable for me. The cabin crew are all very good and hard-working, meals OK for Economy and the Oryx entertainment system way above many competitors, but I found it hard to enjoy all this due to the problems mentioned.  We had 55 min connection at CPH (QR to SAS) but since QR was delayed due to an extremely long taxiing at DOH, we managed to catch SAS thanks to the security check and passport control at CPH, however, our bags didn't make it and came 24 hrs later due to the fact that QR has one ground handling agent at CPH and SAS another. All in all, QR is a good airline to fly with and DOH is a great airport as suggested by fellow travellers as well but, in my opinion, the cramped cabins in Economy don't reflect a five-star experience and the cabin crew struggle on the narrow aisles to provide five-star service they have been so well trained for. A mixed bag, really."

Doha to Munich Bus to flight. 777. Decent seat pockets. Inflight shopping magazine available. My special meal was remembered! Free wifi was available for an hour. Entertainment range is the same as the previous flight and even though the system is clearly older, it worked just as well. Good flight, pity this was for the shorter connecting flight."

Mohamed Tadkar",,29th December 2018,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Doha,December 2018,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,1,no,1,"  Washington to Doha. I had an award ticket and wanted to change the date on my return. I have modified my ticket in the past during previous holidays and it was a relatively easy process usually completed with a single phone call to Qatar Airways customer service. I called Qatar Airways and the representative informed me that I should contact the Privilege Club department, as Qatar Airways does not deal with award tickets. I called the Privilege Club department which informed me that I need to submit my request using their online contact center. If this wasn’t already a convoluted process, the automatic response to my request from the contact center was that I had to wait 3 business days before my request could be tended to. How is this practical when a customer needs to make an urgent change? My request was simple - I just wanted to know what dates were available for me to change my return ticket to and what the cost of implementing such a change would be. The response I finally received three business days later, was a generic one that did not even address my request. They replied stating that a change would cost $25 if completed 24 hours or more prior to departure and $100 if within 3 and 24 hours of departure. However, they did not provide me with any answer as to what dates were available for me to change my award ticket to. Not only did I have to wait for 3 business days to receive a response, but the response I received was completely unhelpful and useless. Having to wait 3 business days to get a response is unreasonable, especially when the responses are not helpful. My case was an urgent one and could not wait a week, let alone three business days.  attempted to contact someone from the Privilege Department on Friday and was told that my request would be expedited. I tried to follow up the next day but because it was a Saturday, the offices were closed. I tried to call on Sunday and was informed that the office was closed. What is the point of being a privilege club member if the customer helpline is not open on Saturdays and Sundays while the general Qatar Airways customer service helpline is? I would rather be a standard, non-privilege customer and receive more reliable and timely customer service, than be a privilege club customer and have to wait days upon days for anything that even remotely resembles a response."

Movies titles were limited, the charging port doesn't work and seat was uncomfortable. I wrote to Qatar but the response quoted  the conditions of carriage that the flight is subject to change without notice. I would have expected a more positive response and it was a huge disappointment that Qatar failed to deliver and resolve my expectations of deciding to travel with the airline solely for the Q-suite experience.

When I reached the check in counter, the lady was weighing my cabin baggage which exceeded the allowed weight by 5kg. She therefore refused me to allow it on board and asked me to put things out. Unfortunately it was a bag that I could not leave as checked baggage, as it was a very expensive and I had also things there I needed on board.  I  understand policies, but  I have allowed checked baggage of 30kg and I'm not using it; why is it not possible to allow a cabin bag to exceed 5 kg? I was standing there 20 minutes and she did not proceed with the ticket. In the end I got really mad, as I knew the only option was to throw out my close bag to get rid of the 5kg. So in the end I lost my closing times at the airport. On the plane I felt like the whole service was running slow this time and we've been waiting longer to get the first meal (on the flight from Denpasar). Everything else has been fine as usual: good seats, good entertainment and overall very nice staff. This action really disappointed me quite a lot. "

Upgraded from N-class to U-class (business upgrade) for credits in their FFP. Flights on time despite economy was overly full on both sectors and even business also on last stretch (DOH-FRA). Check-in in KGL took ages due to incompetent 3rd part company who don’t know basic and ask a lot of superfluous questions which already are in the computer and on the BPs. Lounge decent, large, good snack and hot dishes - but no lane view as windows are blinded with ugly tape. Business passengers got special bus to drive 250 meters, a joke and waste of time and resources. Onboard: welcome drinks provided, food is embarrassing for QR and is getting worse and worse the 2 most recent years. FA’s and drinks are top notch, however. Hardware and precision is unchallenged. Q-suites is over-rated unless you fly in a group and want to be together. Was granted access to the Al Mourjan lounge in Doha which normally denies even One World elite travelers on upgrades. Terrible bus-gating in Doha. Takes hours and undermine any feel of the qualities provided onboard. They have separate biz buses to reduce the pain for elite travelers but the difference is minimal as all are reduced to public transport which only leaves when the bus is full. Worse is the charity announcements on board. Very introduce and ridiculous. Even worse is the extended flying time from most African and South American countries due to the ban from UAE and others. "

Avoid flying this airline if you have a heavy carry on - the carry-on weight limit is 7kg, my carry on weight totaled 9kg. I happened to have one check-in bag which was already 5lbs over limit. I could not place things inside the check-in bag from my backpack. SoI had to pay $700 extra to fly the same flight for the next day. This taught me the lesson of having a spare bag to carry that you can check in for the situation of having an overweight carry-on. I also learned the lesson of booking directly with Qatar Airways instead of an online website. You will pay hundreds of dollars extra to change a ticket with an online website. When I flew back from Bangkok , the ticketing agent there was also extremely anal retentive about my carry-on weight. I wish Qatar let people pay extra money (overweight baggage fee) in order to board. I would rather pay an extra $150 for a heavy carry-on than a $700 change ticket change charge. "

The outbound was great, as I have come to expect with QR (who I have been flying with long haul premium for about 4 years). Nothing to be faulted. The 787 was a great business class, enhanced by the quality of the product and service. On the other hand, the 777 from Doha to JFK took the business class experience to a totally new level. The QSuites product, in my mind, is the best business class offering around, which compares favourably with the FC offering of some major airlines. Not to mention the numerous onboard staff and their fantastic service - in particular a young gent who led the onboard team from Doha to Jakarta on the return leg was outstanding! This is not to ignore the contributions of the other young gents and ladies who made both my trips a totally memorable experience. To summarise, QR business class was an outstanding product, mainly thanks to the commitment of their people. QR QSuites takes this to a totally new level! To get the perfect product, QR should either provide free internet for their premium customers (and reduce the pricepoint for the economy) or be more generous with the allowances, and reduce internet access prices. I suspect that this will happen soon anyway."

Excellent flight on a refurbished aircraft that has completely changed the business class travel experience on this route by creating a sense of big space while providing much needed privacy. On previous travel on this morning flight from Doha to JFK, the plane had a 2-2-2 open layout -- affording no privacy at all while being crowded, having to jump over a passenger if you were not on the aisle seat. Now, the new Q-Suite layout has changed all that. The configuration is 1-2-1, some seats face the back of the plane. There is a ""door"" that seals off your little cubicle equipped with all you need - plug and charge points, large pull out desk table to eat and work on, counters to keep your possessions, a hook to hang your coat, a cupboard for your footwear, reading lights, duvets, pillows, a large TV screen with numerous entertainment choices, and a seat that adjusts in many ways including lie flat. I was able to sleep several hours in absolute privacy in a window seat, 3A. The flight attendants are drawn from many countries of the world and they speak English well. There was a very large menu of food and drinks - cards listing them provided. Qatar provides meals and drinks on request throughout the flight. I am not partial to this form of service. One has to either call the flight attendant or go to the alley to place one's order -- they are delivered to your seat. Overall, the quality of the food is so-so but you are bound to find something that you fancy. Too much effort goes into laying the table cloth and the folded napkin across the waist and setting the place and cleaning it, time and again. Qatar is having an outsize impact on the environment by being so extravagant with their on-demand food and drink service. The flight was smooth and arrived on time. Choice of hot and cold towels were offered at take off and landing. Amenities kit was a hard shell bag, pink in color. Arrival was at Terminal 8 at JFK which is very good compared to the other terminals - in terms of space, facilities, and quickness of official services. I arrived alert and rested."

The aircraft was an Airbus 320 with old-style Business class seats. I had a window seat in row 2 of 3. The flight was just over 6 hours long and I felt terribly uncomfortable for the whole duration of the flight. When the seats in front of me were fully reclined it gave a claustrophobic feeling and it was very difficult to get up from the seat. It would have been okay for 2 hours but not for 6. The service was a little confused with two FA’s for a full Biz class cabin (12 pax). iPads delivered for entertainment but very limited selection.

Unfortunately, there were some problems at the gate for the flight to Boston in the Doha airport, such as a seat reassignment due to a supposed change in aircraft (which does not seem to have occurred after all), boarding which was delayed by about 40 minutes (which led to a departure which was 40 minutes late, too), and a staff member in charge of boarding who appears to have been angry at some passengers for not showing up only when their zone was called, despite her not audibly calling anyone up for boarding after the initial invitation for business class and special assistance passengers! The cabin crew for this particular flight were outstanding and made up for the issues with the ground staff! This particular flight featured quite possibly the worst turbulence I have ever endured in my life--and I once flew through a typhoon. The flight attendants managed to serve us meals during one of the bumpiest parts of the flight and did not drop or spill anything. They continued to smile and politely ask passengers if they needed anything else. One even offered me a special meal which another passenger had not shown up for!  I am a big fan of Qatar Airways--so much so that I endure 8 hour long layovers in Doha every time I fly with them, just because the experience is wonderful every time. The food is delicious, creative, and plentiful. It's also often the cheapest ticket! This time for example, my round trip ticket was for less than $900! But this time in particular, I felt that they went so above and beyond."

Everything went as expected with Qatar but where has the boarding music gone? In my opinion, quality and amount of food has gone down. What is the point in amenity kits apart from the ear plugs and eye shades, does anyone use the socks and how many people brush their teeth on flights? Being a privilege club member I have nearly always taken advantage of the email offers to upgrade 1 or both legs of a flight for a very reasonable price. On this flight I thankfully read the offer through and noticed lounge access is not included and I dont see the value anymore in upgrading. 2nd leg of Doha-Helsinki was less than 1/3 full and business was completely empty and soon they will be upgrading the aircraft to A330 from Boeing 787 from Helsinki."

On arrival there was no stroller and I complained at Qatar airways office at Doha airport directly after arrival before leaving the airport. Since October 4th, I was trying to keep in touch with the baggage service team. I called many many time and every time they answered that they are waiting for the Montreal team to answered. Finally, the day before my flight back to Canada they told me that it’s not Qatar airways liability that I miss the stroller.  I agree that I have to have a tag number but if the staff told me that they cannot give me tag number because of the cargo problem that they have what I can do except trusting them. Most of the staff were amazing but I didn’t like how they were procrastinating and left me for only few hours before my next flight and tell me that they’re not responsible."

Return legs a 4am departure from Mumbai, get there early as Mumbai is chaos - on 777-fairly full flight but crew were pleasant enough. Breakfast served which was quite good. Landed in Doha late which meant connecting to the Heathrow flight was a rush. We landed at gate 20 and the plane for UK departed from Gate 1 so it was a mad rush but the ground staff saw me and informed the gate staff that I was late. On board flight fairly full, somebody was in my seat and refused to move but the senior cabin crew guy took me off to near the front of the plane and found me a better seat -still in economy but aisle/window choice - good and alert response to the situation.

Red eye flight from Kuala Lumpur to Doha. Great lounge at KLIA with ala carte restaurant. Flight was good as always on Qatar. What sets Qatar apart from other carriers is its consistency. The negative aspect of the trip, was again the nightmare of the lounge at Doha airport. It was the busiest time of the day at 6 am, and there was no seat, there were 21 people waiting for a shower which I was told would take 2h to clear. That lounge at peak hours, and the fact that there was no airbridge for arrival and departure with extra time spent to be driven to the plane in a remote position, were the only weakness I see in Qatar but they happen every time I fly. The flight from Doha to Munich was in their gorgeous Qsuite with impeccable service."

Qatar Airways flies from London Heathrow Terminal 4. Check in was fast and efficient, we were offered last minute upgrades to business class for £590.00 for both of us on the DOH-CMB leg- we would have been happy to pay for it if it meant we get the extra tier points and miles (Me and my partner are both OW Sapphires but the check in agent said we won't get any of the extra benefits except for the flat beds). We politely asked for our bags to be tagged as fragile and she happily obliged and added a 'First Class' tag instead of 'Business' due to us being OW Sapphires. Requested for front row bulkhead seats and this was done with no hesitation. Overall, check in experience with Qatar Airways at LHR T4 was swift and efficient. As oneworld Sapphires, we get business class lounge and we were able to use the Skyteam Lounge which in all honesty is nothing to write about so we hang in there for an extra hour before the Malaysia Airlines Golden Lounge opened. We weren't allowed to use the Qatar Airways Premium Lounge as we were non business class revenue passengers. Boarding, again very timely and efficient. After boarding, we noticed that the carpet on our seats were very wet- we weren't sure if it was vomit, juice or whatever. We spoke to the Inflight Service Manager explaining we weren't happy with the situation and she did her best to find us alternative seats and went the extra mile by finding us exit rows. My partner was not happy sitting in the middle and preferred a window seat and asked if we could go back to our original seats or get upgraded to business class which to our surpise, there was one and was happy to give it to one of us but we both decided we wanted to sit together. After take off, the Inflight Services Manager came to our row with 6 blankets to put on the wet carpet and sprayed it with a fabric freshener and gave us 2 glasses of champagne each for the inconvenience! The flight leaving late in the evening, the cabin crew swung into action to serve dinner and drinks to maximise passenger rest times. Despite what others have said on here regarding QR's inflight meal, they are honestly nothing to write about but disappointing. Small portion, dry and bland. But having eaten in the lounges, it didn't matter to us. Cabin crew were fairly stingy with drinks as well, only giving one 150 ml can unless you ask for two. Unlike other airlines such as Qantas, Cathay Pacific and American Airlines, you get a 200 mls or 330 mls sized can opended for you and get given another can! The second meal service before landing in Doha was slightly better. The pancake was delicious. Qatar Airways' IFE selection was great, I watched one movie and the rest trying to get some rest and listening to the massive selection of music albums. IFE screen was responsive though showing its age. With the overall onboard service of Qatar Airways, I find that the onboard service to be inconsistent. Whilst the Inflight Services Manager went the extra mile to make sure our flight was a comfortable one and repeatedly apologised for the inconvenience due to the wet carpet, the younger and more juinor flight attendants were dismissive and inconsistent and the onboard meals and drink service is a bit of a hit and miss. Special small touches such as the amenity kit, comfy pillow and blanket made this flight comfortable."

It was a great looking flight initially but the reality is I’m flying via Heathrow and will be further out of pocket and face 36 hours of travel. No upgrade offered, nothing except Doha accommodation. Last year we had 24 hours in Doha as a result of poor connection time frames and this year we ran to the connecting flight. Qatar Airways let us down with their schedule changes and optimistic connection time allocation. No matter how good the flight , customers don’t want extra travel time and costs, time in Doha or cancelled schedules and if those things do happen it is very much appreciated when airlines understand that."

Inflight entertainment was not working properly so had to change seat (1st flight). FA and service onboard good, but food is poorer than before. E.g. no beef or fish are available. Lamb chops appeared to be some tough meat. Drinks are fine but sparsely loaded (they ran out of 2 beer brands and remained with Heineken only). No ice-cream. Doha-Saigon leg was a perfect flight, the FAs were fantastic, very proactive and truly caring. Food was much better on this leg as compared to the previous. Got a delicate cod as main dish.

R Neil",,2nd October 2018,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Sydney via Doha,August 2018,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,,3,no,2,"  I booked a return flight with Qatar Airways from Sydney for a family trip to France. We had a good experience on the way to Paris and at Doha airport, flying with our young children. Our return flight was a morning flight at 8:55am from CDG airport. We had checked in online the night before. Due to a series of issues at CDG airport we arrived at the check-in counter at 8:10am, late for check-in, which closes 60 minutes before the flight. I immediately attended the Qatar Airways desk, where I explained the situation to an employee. The only response I obtained was “you cannot get on the flight, we will put you on the next flight”. There was no attempt on behalf of the employee to problem-solve or to offer us solutions to get on our flight. At my insistence, she contacted the gate staff and again stated we would not be able to board the flight. At no stage did the employee suggest that part of our travelling party could board the flight with hand luggage only as we had already checked in online. This would have been a helpful suggestion allowing us time to reorganise our luggage and take essential items. However, the employee did not have a friendly or helpful approach, seeming to just want to put us on the next flight which was 14 hours later and would cost 2200 euros in fees. This was not an option for our family. I asked if my wife and the children could board with hand luggage only. The employee replied that it was too late. I insisted that she call the gate to see if this was a possibility. She called the gate and then told us again that it was too late, that the gate closes 20 minutes prior to departure and it was now 8:30, 25 minutes prior to departure. The employee stated that it would not be possible for us to reach the gate in five minutes- again no help was offered and her attitude was bad. At this point, we discounted her advice and ran to the gate as fast as possible with our two young children. This was a difficult experience for them and they were crying. If the employee had informed us of this option even 10 minutes earlier, we would not have had to rush as much as we did. Luckily the CDG airport staff were very helpful and my wife and children were able to get on the flight with our hand luggage. I returned to the Qatar Airways desk to re-book another flight in the evening.  When I checked-in in the evening, I had to deal with poor customer service again.  I have contacted Qatar Airways customer service on several occasions in the past month but their responses have basically been ‘we are very sorry about this’ but they refuse to offer any compensation or explanation. I will not fly with Qatar Airways again, which is a shame because their inflight services were pretty good but the staff at Paris CDG airport were nasty."

On the return from Casablanca to Hong Kong, it happened to hit the worst typhoon in Hong Kong, so I ended up stuck in Doha airport for 17 hours while they keep delaying the flight time. There was no support at the airport, just told the passengers to wait for a while longer and asked people to go from one service counter to another for information. When they finally decided to delay the flight for another 8 hours, it was another 1.5 hour wait for them to arrange hotel accommodation. I spent 8 hours waiting at Doha airport from 5am until 1pm. They explained there were over 300 passengers waiting and that’s why it’s taken longer to arrange hotel. But that could be avoided if they announced cancellation of the flight earlier. "

This was the first time my wife and I had flown with Qatar Airways and my first international flight from Canberra. The B777 from Canberra are now the “Suites” version - as impressive as many reviewers have already reported and the onboard service - personal attention, food, beverage (see further comment below), in flight entertainment, ambience and comfort - as many have already stated is unmatched. My main purpose with this review is to provide guidance to passengers from CBR with the procedures unique to Canberra airport. Check-in opens three hours prior to departure and guidance indicates it closes one hour prior to departure, this is conducted by QANTAS staff at the far left QF check-in desks with the usual friendly, helpful assistance. The first of two security checks is conducted as if you were a regular domestic passenger. Qatar uses the QANTAS Business Class lounge for BC passengers, QANTAS Club members travelling in economy will not get access as they do not have a QF flight number. Approximately one hour prior to departure BC passengers are invited to access the international area of the airport - the length of the terminal and in Virgin territory. Having gone up another level there is the Border Force passport check (electronic for those with suitable passports) followed by the second full regime security check. The international departure gate now has limited duty free sales and coffee shop, snacks, bar facilities. In our case boarding was delayed by about 25 minutes meaning a longer than expected wait. Boarding was by class through separate desks. Onboard an allocated flight attendant explained the features of the Suite for first timers and offered a pre departure drink (only water and juices were mentioned but champagne is available if requested). After the short 30 minute hop to Sydney all passengers are required to disembark with all their carry-on. There are no further formalities at SYD, disembarkation being directly into the departures concourse; there is ample time to get to the QANTAS BC lounge ard have lunch if so desired. The 15 hour flight post SYD had only one low point from Qatar’s otherwise outstanding point of view, despite the glossy wine and beverage menu (two champagnes, three whites, three reds with a “stickey” and a port plus beers, spirits and soft drinks) within four hours, and still over Australia, the whites had been exhausted. Nevertheless Qatar will feature high on our radar whilst current standards are maintained - or built on."

The business class on return was superb, the cabin staff were excellent and keen to chat with my self and my son who appreciated being treated like an adult and being allowed to choose what he wanted from the menu. The flight was full both ways so I hope this service continues despite the rough and ready ground service at Cardiff which was the exception to that we encountered elsewhere on our journey."

D Melendor",,14th September 2018,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Delhi to Doha,September 2018,5.0,1.0,1.0,,5.0,,4,yes,2,"  Delhi to Doha. The airline is amazing as I have been flying with Qatar airways ever since. Service was excellent, but only the exception on this trip I was disappointed that the cabin crew have chit chat with one guy for good 5-10 minutes while doing the meal service, and was not bothered that there are some passengers waiting. Given that I was seated on the last row, maybe the lady crew was thinking that it is fine to have some nice chit chat while keeping other passengers, which makes me a bit irritated. I decided to go back to sleep since i am not so sure if the lady is planning to give me my meal or not, after few minutes she tap my shoulder and asked what would I prefer for breakfast, i mentioned non-veg meal, but since she is not listening and gave me a non-veg meal.I was about to tell her but as soon as I receive my meal, the lady continued with the chitchat. I decided to just have the bread and tea. I would recommend to brief the crew to maintain to their professional image, chit chat is nice but it should not bother or affect other passengers."

LHR to Doha was great in A380, seat was comfortable, IFE was super but what stands out was the service by the crew.  Food was alright, nothing special, but I did end up feeling rather hungry in transit. Doha-KUL was awful on A340, crammed, people wanted to sit with other family members and disrupted the seating set up for others. In the end, I was made to move because a father and his son wanted to sit together.  Made to sit on aisle seat at 4 in a row. After take off, a flight attendant came to deliver and by hand luggage from where I had sat and stowed it. Nice gesture but a little bit indifferent at my displeasure at having to move from my booked seats. Uncomfortable seat, IFE temperamental. Food was okay. I would order special diet/meal next time."

I was very impressed by the on board facilities overall. My special request for the food was approved and it was good. The flight attendants were fairly attentive and the arrival was on time almost all times.

I had to stay in airport in Casablanca for 10 hours and no  courtesies were offered for the trouble although I am a privilege club member.

Qatar Airways is by far the best business class product I have seen. It beats emirates and etihad hands down. The food is outstanding, cabin comfort is great,  and all food is on demand. The lounge though very crowded at times in morning serves much better food than emirates. Biggest down side compared to emirates is no chauffeur drive. The lounge they use in Atlanta is club atl which is ludicrous. It would be an insult to call it a lounge. "

On the 17th  August, Our 2330 pm flight QR929 was canceled. This was because an accident happened a day before when Xiamen Air MF8667 skidded off the runway in a rainy thunderstorm, which led the main runway to be closed. At around 2030 pm, I went to the Main office in the terminal if our flight was canceled or not, and it was. I asked for priority accommodation because I was traveling with my immobile mother who needs rest and my son. They did not refuse as my mother is a priority passenger, and they said that they will give us accommodation also because we checked out of our condominium in Quezon City, and we had no where else to stay. The polite and very nice staff at Qatar Airways is to give us contact numbers for the new flight the next day when the runway will open, then we got on a bus to a five-star hotel that we were amazed by, which the airline paid for, not us! The next day, we get a text from the coordinator that there will be a flight at 1730 pm QR2929, we quickly packed our things and checked out. We finally got to the airport (Terminal 1) and it was shambolic, stranded passengers, crowded, with no coordination, but it was not Qatar Airways' fault, it was the airports' disappointment of not organizing this problem fluently. It took us a while for us to check-in, too crowded, especially with my disabled mom, we got through immigration, security, we finally then got to gates, In an airport, they did not have enough working boards, all of them were not working at all and we couldn't understand where to go at all, except on our ticket, our flight was supposed to depart 1730pm but we departed around 2215pm but I understand, there were too many passengers to handle though. we boarded via stairs and I complained that we did not use a lifter for catering, but that wasn't the airlines' fault though. we got into the cabin my son seated in a different row, while a sat with my mother, the seats were comfortable, the IFE was good, and the food wasn't the best but appetizing, and the staff was very helpful. We landed in Doha, and we missed our 0155 am the QR27 flight to Manchester, they gave us another flight to catch at 0810 am with no fee at all and the expectations were the same as the previous flight."

The service was poor, I had hardly any water offered on 15-hour flight. I found the vegetarian food disgusting, I actually returned it. The films selection is fairly good but te screen doesn't totally switches off so you end up with bright light in your face. "

Staff on board were friendly and helpful couldn't ask for more, however the seat was very hard and uncomfortable. I was in the middle of a 3 seat combination, my husband on one side and a larger (wide) man on the other who decided that sitting for the whole flight with his legs wide open and his body taking a 1/3 of my seat made the flight very awkward. This is too close for comfort. When the food was served it was hard to make out what the food was - there was a croissant with one of meals, it was so shriveled up. Scrambled eggs with some dreadful sauce on it, other food offerings I found to be poor. My husband is 6'3"" so when fellow passenger in front reclined his seat the space became impossible.  Just improve on the quality of the food and give us a bit more space, it would make a world of difference."

My last flights onboard of A350 from Adelaide to Doha and A380 from Doha to Melbourne were absolutely fantastic.

Crew were extremely friendly and clearly wanted to give a five star experience to their customers. Doha first class lounge is the best I have been. No doubt they have won a lot of awards. You need to travel with them to appreciate their superb service. A380 first class lacks as much privacy as in emirates but the seat and service makes up for all that. There are only 8 seats and crew give total attention and makes the journey one of the most memorable.

It was my first time on Qatar's A359 and I can't help but notice the improvements in its new economy class product. Seat pitch was superb, and much more spacious than its Dreamliner counterpart. The new Thales entertainment system was intuitive, but the selection pales in comparison with Emirates. The gray seats provided a contrast with the maroon seat covers. While the Dreamliner economy was OK, it pales in comparison with the A359's. My only gripe with this particular A359 was that the WCs seem clunky, especially for a new aircraft. One was out of order, while the order had a broken toilet seat. As usual, Qatar's inflight service is commendable. Attendants were very responsive, courteous, and pleasant. Drinks were frequently offered, which is a practice that I would like to see in other airlines. On the DOH-CRK leg, a flight attendant was concerned that my preferred dinner from the menu was unavailable (I was on one of the last rows served), and so she made sure that I get the first pick for breakfast. These little things leave a lasting impression. I've been on a lot of trips, including many with QR, and I can't remember a time where the FAs go this extra. And of course, flying with QR will likely take you on a layover at DOH - the best airport in the Middle East. Good things aside, the flight out of ZRH was delayed for more than half an hour, which means that my almost two-hour transit time at DOH would be cut short. It wasn't the airline's fault, but it was a good call on their part to dock at a remote gate at DOH and ferry the passengers via bus directly to the transit security check. Unfortunately my checked in luggage did not make the transfers."

The cabin service is outstanding - friendly and supremely efficient but never intrusive. Wonderful food beautifully served and every kind of drink you can think of! The airport in Doha is like a five-star hotel and the assisted passenger service puts Heathrow and Edinburgh to shame. We had a transfer time of just over an hour between our flights and our suitcases were waiting at the carousel when we arrived. A great improvement on last year's experience from Heathrow to Edinburgh when we had four hours between flights and British Airways only managed to deliver one of our suitcases 36 hours later! The Boeing 787 is a great aircraft but we preferred the cabin layout of the Boeing 777. We will definitely choose Qatar over any other airline in future. My husband needs a wheelchair so travel can be a bit stressful but I can honestly say, this was the best flight we have ever experienced and we have been flying between South Africa and the UK for 50 years!! Thank you!"

First time on Qatar Airways and they were good. I usually fly Singapore Airlines but my travel partner was a One World flyer so we tried Qatar. Seating on the A380 is very comfy with loads of legroom and what felt like a slightly wider seat than on Singapore Airlines. Crew were lovely on both flights though bar/food service was a bit slow and we had quite a wait. No drinks cart to start with like Singapore Airlines and the food wasn't all that wonderful but compensated for by the spaciousness and the crew themselves. IFE was good though movie list not as extensive as I expected. Crew from DOH to MAD were particularly friendly, professional and they made the flight a real pleasure."

On sitting down it felt as if the seat had no padding and was extremly hard. The crew were lovely, the food was OK and we certainly didn't feel tired on arrival due to the 787 but what a squeeze. Such a small, hard seat- fortunately we had amazing flights on their A380 to/from Australia to compensate."

I am stuck in an airport lounge in Nairobi. A seemingly routine flight from Kuwait to Cape Town has turned into this three day fiasco. On 8th June I booked in as per normal at Kuwait Int Airport. Proceeded to the departure gates and waited to board the plane. The flight at first was delayed, no announcement or information was given. Only when fellow travelers started to get annoyed about the situation did Qatar staff try to explain.  We were to sit and wait, .no explanation. After 2 hours of waiting we were told there are technical issues with the plane. Again told to just wait. Another hour passed and we were told to go the transfer desk, massive confusion at the transfer desk as the staff did not know what was going on. Again we were told to wait, then two options, we wait till they fix the aircraft or take the next flight the next morning. I was then booked on a flight to Nairobi and was told all has been taken care of and that I will be connected with the next flight from Nairobi to Cape Town. Only to arrive in Nairobi and nothing of such was done. The crew in Kuwait did not issue the ticket correctly which led to the crew in Nairobi not being able to issue me with the connecting ticket, making me miss the last flight out to Cape Town. Then I was told failing that they can put me on a flight from Nairobi to JNB and then to CPT. That was 4 hours ago, no one informs or keep one updated. Turns out I won't be on the flight to JNB. I will be booked into a hotel and put on the first flight out in the morning? I am disappointed with this airline. There was no attempt to rectify, or defuse the situation... I have to constantly have to ask what is happening etc. Who knows where my luggage is at this point of time."

The flight was delayed due to the aircraft arriving later. Announcements were audible and clear in the gate area. Boarding was special. US ICE agents lined the jetway asking questions and making us feel really special.  A flight attendant at the door showed me to my seat and offered a pre-departure drink. Crew appearance was sharp and professional. Sincere smiles lead me to believe they enjoy their jobs. Qatar offers dinning on demand in business class. I choose to eat right after departure to sleep on this 14 hour flight. My meal was special order vegetarian and was fresh and good, not great. I enjoyed a Grand Cru Pauillac. The Flight Attendant offered turn down service and he draped my seat with light bedding. In flat sleeping position the seat is wide and has generous width including space for my feet. I was able to sleep 9 hours in peace with the suite door closed. The space inside my suite was more than ample. Easy storage of all personal items. The IFE Screen is large and HD noise cancelling head phones are provided. I didn't find the selection up to the tech, but you can upload files to play using USB or near field connections.

I have flown so many times before with different airlines and I have to say that this is the best airlines i have ever flown with. Having said that, it is not perfect. there are rooms for improvement in my opinion; the toilet could be cleaned more often, the content of the inflight entertainment system could be added more and be more consistent in all route (some route/aircraft type has better and more responsive screen than others), and i do hope some time in the future the fare could be cheaper because they are in the upper range of price."

What a treat!! The entire experience was amazing. The service on board is impeccable. You couldn't really compare it to other airlines' business class. It is definitely better than BA first class experience. Since my class was an upgraded one, I didn't have access to the Al Mourjan lounge at DOH. But I got access to it since the other lounges were full on my first transfer. On my second transfer, I purchased access to Al Mourjan (450 QAR = 125 USD). It was worth every penny since my layover was more than 5 hours. My last leg Doha to Shanghai was in a Q-suite on a B777. Amazing. I loved it and I loved the service. I can't even imagine how Qatar Airways manages to maintain this level of service. It's really a treat for ones soul and body. Many people complain about the lost access to the Al Mourjan lounge on upgraded tickets. Of course its a shame not to spend the layover at that lounge but considering the quality of the food and drinks you get at that lounge, I think QR went back on me paying the 125 USD entrance fee."

Food on this flight was excellent along with an excellent cabin service from the staff on board. I did not use the entertainment system and slept for most of the 10 hour flight so cannot comment on this. The second leg from Doha to Paris was again on a 777 but this time we had the QSuite. Having flown on many different carriers business offering this is by far the best I have seen. We took the 2 centre seats which when converted to flat created a double bed. Having this when travelling with a young child was a huge help. The suites offer maximum privacy and create a sense that you are flying alone. Seats are very comfortable, IFE excellent with large HD screen and lots of viewing options. Food again was very good with lots of options to choose from. Once again the staff were some of the best I have experienced in the sky and nothing was too much trouble for them.

I was already knowing the cabin of The Boeing 787, so the space  was as usual pretty nice and ok. The food was really spicy and full of ingredients so I did not touch it too much. The cabin crew was really patient, polite, and they were really helpful in curating the details, from each guests. It turne out that I forgot my amenity kit at home. As it was a night flight, I asked a member from the cabin crew and she said there were not any available in economy anymore, but she gave the chance to have one from Business class, which I was just in love because of the Brics design. She was so polite, and talented and she was just four months with Qatar Airways, she really made my flight and all my 24h journey. I´m pretty sure she will make a good job and these are the way to create proud and loyal customers."

I was flying coach, so was not expecting to have a first class experience, but neither in economy I would never offer a check in where the agent talks in the meanwhile that she has my baggage and my passport with her colleague about her personal staff. She was rude . Luckily the cabin crew were better and more helpful, but not outstanding, they did not know what was inside the snack they were offering. The cleanliness, space from the aircraft were really good and I loved the flight as well the IFE. If you are flying the Boeing 787 don´t sit too much in the back otherwise you will see more the wing than the sky."

Excellent service, which I have now come to expect from Qatar. They outshine in almost every aspect. One gripe however, is the check in at Edinburgh, which may be managed by One World. This was seriously bad. It took 30 minutes to check in, with 2 passengers in front of me. The staff seem to have no experience in checking passengers in, and they were constantly transferring priority luggage tags, lounge invitations etc between two desks, as if there was no preparation. We were then informed that there was no Fast Track (FT) for security clearance, but when we pointed out to the gate keeper that we were members of OneWorld, they allowed us to proceed through FT. Not sure why Qatar is not listed as a user of FT for its Business Class travellers. Onboard service was impeccable, with professional, efficient and pleasant staff, which is truly noteworthy. Wifi connectivity did not appear to work on the several times I attempted to use it."

G Gilliam",Boeing 777 / 787,18th April 2018,Business,Business Class,Hong Kong to Dublin via Doha,April 2018,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,3,yes,9,"  Hong Kong to Dublin via Doha. An evening service using Boeing 777 on first leg and Boeing 787 from Doha. Check-in was quick and efficient in both airports. Seat 3K (right window) on B777 was comfortable and spacious. Flight attendants were friendly, and addressed me by name. Qatar offer dining on demand, and my excellent dinner arrived when requested. From the menu, lobster stood out, but it was not available. The FA saw my disappointment, and twice during the flight the purser came to apologise. The beef replacement was excellent. Food overall was probably the best I have had on an airplane. Wine was also really good. Couldn't fault the service, with a nice amenity kit, including Georgio Armani after shave balm, after shave, and lots of moisturisers, lip balm etc. Pyjamas are also supplied and it was easy to get 6 hours good sleep. IFE was good, with a reasonable selection, and an excellent moving map display, including simulated head-up display and instrument panel. First leg arrived on time, and then all change to the Boeing 787. Service on to Dublin was of a similar standard, and the breakfast omelette, which came after a nice fruit selection and cereal, was very tasty. The interesting thing here is the comparison between the B777 and 787. The 787's seat (2K window seat), is angled so you have no-one beside you. The Boeing 787 windows are just huge, and are electronically dimmed. Cabin lighting is very sophisticated, but I have to say that overall I was a little disappointed with the Boeing 787. The seat is not as spacious or comfortable as the older 777, and the IFE is decidedly fiddly and unfriendly to use. I could see several passengers needing assistance with it, and the FA's couldn't figure it out either. The moving map display was different also, and strangely for a newer airplane, it was much more basic, and missed most of the nice features available on the 777. Overall, I have to say that Qatar offer an incredibly good service, with amazing food, great staff, a modern fleet, and very comfortable lounges, particularly in Doha. I would seek them out actively in preference to the other middle eastern airlines, and that is really saying something."

Check in at Birmingham was very quick and easy and was given fast track security, although in Birmingham this is pretty badly organised! The lounge is a 3rd party lounge called No.1, which is quite nice and modern inside and with reasonable amount of seating tables etc. Because it is a lounge which you can pay to use they limit how much hot food you can have which is a shame as the portions are not large, although it was actually delicious. Boarding was easy and quick and my amenity kit was already in my seat and I was immediately offered a welcome drink. All crew on board were fantastic throughout the flight. Food and drinks including presentation was more akin to a first class product really. The seat in the 787 is the excellent herringbone config and was very comfortable and with a lot of storage and table space. At Doha I did not have long to change planes so did not have time to enjoy the lounge. On the 777 the service was just as excellent, I didn’t sample the dinner as I went straight to sleep but the breakfast was excellent and the dine in demand meant that it could fit around when I woke up and I wanted to eat, an amazing plus! The 777 was an older one with the old 2-2-2 config which actually isn’t too bad, the seat and bed are both comfortable although as I am quite tall I much prefer a seat with a separate food stool. There is fairly good storage space although limited table space. Regarding IFE, whilst the 787 has a newer system, I actually found the 777 system more responsive and easier to use and the quality was still really good! Overall an outstanding flight and very good value for money. Being able to collect BA points and avios was an added bonus."

Qatar Airways provides a decent service with their flights, but other areas are lacking. You can choose your seats online if you booked with them, which is useful without paying an extra charge. The seats were too narrow in my opinion and leg room was not too generous. Service by the cabin staff was good. The in flight entertainment was okay. Some recent new movies were the highlight. The screen is not very high quality and headphones supplied had to have its connection moved around to work properly, which was not a good experience at all and this happened on my recent flights with them. I was disappointed with the food quantities and frequency. The main meals for breakfast and supper (somehow never got lunch) are very small, notwithstanding that there are some other small accompaniments. The choices of were only basically chicken or vegetarian. The problem that I had with how often meals were served was particularly on one of my connecting flights to Doha, which started boarding at 12:45. They did not serve lunch and instead served supper at 16:00 and in the evening, they only served their tiny hot sandwich, which is a small rectangular pie and a tiny cupcake. As a result, I was very hungry throughout the flight. On arrival to my final destination, my suitcase was also damaged, with two sharp metal parts sticking out from the bottom and when I inquired about it at the baggage desk, they refused to even acknowledge that there was any damage and were quite frankly rude. This was ridiculous. "

A few days before departure Qatar offered an upgrade to Business Class for the 2 legs and we decided to upgrade for about $2500 for Adelaide Doha. This was well worth it, we ate well, our Romanian our flight attendant was excellent and attended to our every need and I managed to sleep about 9 hours. The next leg, Doha to Frankfurt was only 6 hours and it passed uneventfully but in Economy Class. Our return flight, about 12 days later from Frankfurt to Doha passed quickly as well. On the nearly 14 hour flight from Doha to Adelaide we each had a row of seats. The A350 which Qatar uses for the 14 hours long haul, has a 3x3x3 configuration which made sleeping possible. But economy class food left a lot to be desired. I was served lamb in apricot sauce which was so dry that I think they forgot about the sauce. For the brunch I opted for the Cheddar Cheese scrambled egg and this was also very dry . However, the desserts served were of a good enough standard. Boeing 777 middle row of 4 seats is very squeezy by comparison to the A350 and there is little space for 8 legs and feet. The flight attendants were friendly and efficient."

The IFE on the A350 is great and easy to use. The B777 less so. At JFK, we were delayed leaving. The ground staff made no announcements about the delay for over two hours. They only made one when I finally trudged up to the small, packed, outdated gate area and told them they needed to. Then, a chaotic boarding commenced that was a free-for-all. In DOH, I missed my connection by a half hour or so. There was no ground staff there with information on my flight to Kigali, I had to go to their transfer desk to get vouchers for the stay in Doha. Next morning the immigration was woefully understaffed. It took 1 hour to clear immigration because there were a couple of disinterested workers and hundreds of passengers needing to get through. Security screening can be hit and miss. Things allowed through some times, next time they are taken. "

Flights on time. Service on board fine, food is deteriorating (small portions, oily, no meat options), but FAs and drink offers almost make up for it. Qatar as a country suffers tremendously from the Arab ban/embargo put on them from their neighbours causing increased food prices and for QR it implies huge deroutings on most African and S-American destinations (add up to 3 hours per leg!). FAs are the best in the air, always focused, energetic, proactive, attentive, and committed, and hardworking. Rarely – if ever? Have I seen better FAs. Personalised service for everybody onboard the business class cabin. They still do charity collections onboard – to my view a violation of passengers. IFE very good. Bus-gating in Doha annoying and tedious."

The business cabin on the B787 planes is at the front of the plane, since there is no first class. At the second door a small onboard self-service bar is in place where champagne, wine and snacks are provided during the flight. Two additional seats can be found behind the bar and between the toilets, these are not recommended. Due to the small cabin (compared to the A380 cabins) the atmosphere is much warmer and the staff can pay more attention to passengers. The overhead compartments are missing above the middle seats that makes the cabin more spacious, but middle seat passengers must use the storage above the window seats. Usually it is not a problem, the space is still enough, but I felt uncomfortable in disturbing others by opening the storage above them. The 1-2-1 herringbone configuration seats provide great comfort and space, they are like first class seats at some other airlines. They can be converted to a full-flat bed, however some may find the leg space limited. The screen is large enough and the noise cancellation headsets close out every disturbance. Since it was a day flight, pajamas were only available upon request. The service was excellent and Qatar Airways' on-demand a'la carte menu allows passengers to meal whenever and whatever they wish. Before take-off the flight attendants book the meal requests and the preferred time of the serving, then they return when time comes. Of course passengers can change their mind anytime but it is worth booking the meals in advance to ensure they do not run out. In my case they ran out of Hungarian desert wine Tokaji but substituted with an Australian one. The meals were delicious, but not show-stopping. The entertainment system could have a bigger selection of movies and the browsing the selection should be available via the main screen instead of the touch screen equipped remote control. WiFi is for free up to 10MB (!) more can be purchased, however it is really slow and occasionally working."

But still, they are well ahead of most business seats of other airlines. The onboard service was excellent and smooth.

It is a nice thing, but it means that people eat in different times, hence the flight attendants run up and down the cabin during the whole flight and smell of food is always present in the cabin.

The same happened in Kathmandu despite my very clear instructions that we were going to Doha. When I saw that incorrect bag tags had been printed she was quite rude telling me that I should have told her that we were only going to Doha.  Doha airport has been built to a very high standard, there is a train to take passengers to the gates, however arriving passengers must walk to the terminal. Admittedly almost everyone on both flights into Doha were in transit. We were not. The passport process was very poor. At least an hour wait on both occasions. There are 36 immigration gates, of which no more than five were manned. After the first stay in Doha we found the check-in process for our flight to Kathmandu relatively simple. I'm OneWorld sapphire member, and the process worked OK. Qatar Airways has a lounge that permits entry to OneWorld  members and we were able to enjoy a breakfast before joining the flight to Kathmandu. After the second stay in Doha we had to checkin at a special area for passengers travelling to the USA. We later learnt on return to the US that our miles from Doha to Atlanta did not appear in our AA accounts. Of the 45 minutes we expected to have in the Qatar Airways lounge to have breakfast we had just 20 minutes before we were called to the gate. Passengers with computers or iPads were sent to a special security area and devices checked and placed in sealed plastic bags which could not be opened until on board the aircraft.  My wife's iPad is in a very tightly fitting leather protective case. The security people insisted that this had to be removed which proved very difficult. The leather case was never examined and just returned to her, so what that proved I have no idea. All this additional security meant that the flight departed Doha late and in turn arrived late in Atlanta. The food on Qatar Airways is very basic. I was unimpressed with Qatar Airways and next year when we visit Bhutan we will use a different OneWorld carrier."

I have been flying with them for 10 years and I'm a part of the Privilege Club Program. Due to technical problems, my flight from Jakarta to Warsaw via Doha was delayed, so I was redirected to Brussels but Qatar Airways forgot to book me the further flight to Warsaw, which led to my 25 hours late arrival in Warsaw. My destination was Poznań, I had to change the ticket 3x and pay the extra costs. In Brussels, representatives of Qatar Airways told us that all costs associated with our travel will be compensated by Qatar Airways. After describing the events and sending them to the given address, they advised that the Regulation EC261 is not applicable, and does not apply to Non-European Carriers' flights to the EU."

Really impressed with the lounge in Bangkok, quiet, clean and excellent service. Qatar A380 business has to be my favorite aircraft, so quiet and comfortable. Boeing 787 to Copenhagen was full, I don’t like this cabin compared to that of both the 380 and 350 - I feel you are more ‘exposed’ even though it’s the same seat and the 787 is by far a noisier aircraft. One area where Qatar needs to improve is the food, it was abysmal on both sectors, the offering from Doha was disgusting. The crew were fine, but I find few crew engaging until the end of the flight where they ‘have’ to ask if your flight was enjoyable, it seems staged."

Booked flight that morning due to family emergency, couldn't afford any delays. Well 52 hours later I arrived in Ireland. QR905 delayed due to mechanical ex Melbourne, no info from QR, relied on Qantas lounger updates, probably a visit from uniformed QR staff to lounge would have been in order, finally boarded 3 hours late which meant missed connecting flight to LHR. QR had me overnighting in hotel to take direct flight DOH-DUB next day, however after much debate with ground team they put me on another flight to LHR 6 hours later, which that ended up delayed, would have missed connecting flight to DUB so full circle and I went to hotel and took direct flight next day. Transfers all arranged and voucher for meals, can't fault the disruption service. Service on MEL -DOH was average,  no interaction from the male FA. Service can border on robotic, very impersonal. Seat comfortable, like the lounge behind business class, great place to stretch out. I found the cabin too hot,Wifi very slow and patchy, the free MB goes in seconds. Flexible airfare so premium price paid. QR still far superior to majority of other airlines, just need to improve the ground staff support, will continue to fly with them."

Ground Crew not friendly. Allowed 2 suitcases at 23kg and one carry on. We only had one checked baggage and one carry on each, so below by one checked baggage. Because my CPAP bag was temporary on top of the Carry on they wanted me to pay extra. I explained that I can take my Medical bag off and an argument by the staff started. Eventually a Supervisor intervened and commonsense kicked in. The crew onboard were far from friendly except for the JNB to DOH that flight was as all flights should be, friendly and with good friendly service. Entertainment screen was only 8 inches away from my face. Most of the time my entertainment system didn't work by the Touch Screen or by the Hand Control. Main food meal was tasty and good but snack food tasted awful. Water was regularly offered throughout all flights. "

This was a pleasant trip with Qatar Airways. All the cabin crew members were friendly and attentive. Plenty of drinks were offered, and when we asked for anything the crew went the extra mile to fulfil our wishes. One of our B773ER planes and the A330 still had the old Oryx One entertainment system with a low-resolution screen - the newer entertainment systems on the other planes were excellent! Especially the flight in their B787 was very comfortable, even in economy class. The A330 cabin was rather dated, they should retrofit these planes with newer seats. The food was excellent compared to other economy products. Transfer in Doha was smooth. The only issue on this trip were the rude and incompetent local airport ground staff at SGN who conducted check-in for Qatar Airways: they enforced the weight limits for baggage down to the last gram, as strictly as for any low-cost carrier. I can‘t imagine Qatar‘s own staff to be that stringent on weight limits."

Nathan Jones",A380,13th March 2018,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Sydney via Doha,March 2018,3.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,,4,yes,6," This was my first long haul economy flight in a decade. After been fortunate enough to fly in the front quite often I was on a money saving effort and so did London Heathrow to Sydney return via Doha in economy. I scored a great fare in their annual January sale. I found the service was very good on all flights. I was in the upper deck economy cabin at the back and found the crew to be pleasant and also very responsive whenever I asked for another drink. The legroom was about as good as it will get in economy, which is to say it wasn’t complete torture. It’s up there with the best. The inflight entertainment was sufficiently diverse to occupy me for four long flights, with a mix of older and very new releases. I’d say one of the better systems. Oneworld sapphire and emerald members are treated as second class citizens. Staff were falling over themselves for a QR silver member (OW Ruby) on one leg of my journey which I found odd. This was until I realised that in Doha if you fly economy you don’t have access to the regular business class lounge but  a second tier lounge. Having experienced the Al Mourjan lounge previously I can say the Qatar business class lounge is less superior (think run of the mill AA lounge in the US). Overall the experience as a Sapphire or Emerald member doesn’t matter to Qatar. I had heard that upper deck economy is reserved for premium fliers - this is incorrect. You will get first dibs on the seats, but then it’s open season once online check-in opens. On my DOH-LON flight the lower deck was a third full whilst the upper deck was 3/4 full. I found the food revolting, particularly noteworthy was a chicken biryani from DOH to SYD. But it’s economy so you get what you pay for I guess. Overall I would definitely pay for Qatar in business class, but an indirect route in economy is not something I’ll be seeking out again. No matter how you dress it up economy is economy."

The seats are difficult to move from reclined back straight. 5/10 Service was ok but not at the top of the market when compared to Singapore, Cathay or even Qantas. I wished to change the food order for the children but the hostess made only a brief attempt to find alternative meals and then never came back to let me know definitively that no meals were available. 5/10 Food: Very average meals, serves are small and generally would advise steering clear of European style meals.

These two flights had both good and bad. Copenhagen to Doha, the seat on the 787 is far superior to that of the old style seat on some 777. However the food was bad , the chicken was inedible and the crew were noisy in the galley. The lounge experience in Doha was again, exemplary. The staff are so friendly and the waiter service and a la carte menu impressive. Boarding for the BKK sector was a bit of a scrum, they could make the priority lane more prominent. It was literally a case of pushing through passengers trying to board. Doha-Bangkok sector and the crew couldn’t have been more different from their colleagues on the Copenhagen sector. For such an early morning departure they were friendly and had a genuine warmth. Food was much better, supper was delivered speedily after take off, and the pancakes for breakfast were delicious. The one thing that lets down QR on the old 777 are the seats, it was uncomfortable to sleep on, but I was so tired I managed a few hours. All in all though a much more positive experience than my previous flights with QR."

Punctual flights, uneventful. 3 hours scheduled additional time delay avoiding overflying Saudia Arabia. FAs are excellent – world-class. Annoying announcements – many of them superfluous. They continue their charity propaganda for Educate a Child – that really puzzles me. How naïve are we passengers to blindly support financially some glossy outlayed institution without providing neutral facts? The 2nd flight left 02 a.m. and did hardly have any food for business class. No real hot dishes – no fish, no meat, only cold piece salmon was offered. They offered a beef filet which was only a spoon of rice with some shredded meat in a heavy brown sauce. No chilli, no fishsauce, no ginger, no icecream, no nothing. I was only saved by an alert FA who managed to secure me a reasonable meal of fish from economy class. Never experienced this before when travelling in business class. Seats in these A330 aircraft are lie flat but narrow that your feet are squeezed if stretching the legs out into a tiny hole under the seat in front. Paid by far too much for this ticket. However, luggage and lounge access functioned well."

My flight from London was delayed by nearly 2 hours, however when I checked in I was offered to be moved to the earlier flight (which was about to board). I accepted and for my troubles I was given an exit row on my first flight and an entire row to myself on the second. Qatar economy has nearly 2 extra inches on most other airlines and you can tell. As someone who is only 5ft 10 I had more than enough room on the second leg. Service is generally very good, however the food and drink selections are a little basic compared to Emirates, offering only Red label scotch, Smirnoff vodka and Beefeater gin. Food was just okay. The IFE was good, without being great, offering largely B-list films with 2 or 3 blockbusters. Qatar offers 10 minutes/10mb of free WiFi which is basically enough to check your Twitter, then 30 minutes for $6USD. It's a nice touch, but very steep compared to Emirates flight long Wi-Fi for $1USD. Overall, if bad scotch and average movies don't bother you, Qatar is for you.

I travelled along with my 4 months old son and my mother on Jan 22nd. First I need to tell about my bad experience with other airlines then only you will understand my wonderful experience with Qatar Airways. We booked online to travel on Jan 21st from Canton, Ohio to Chicago through American Airlines, from Chicago to Hyderabad via Doha but AA flight got delayed for several hours and they don’t know how much time it takes, they were keep on changing AA flight time, later we realized it’s impossible to catch connecting flight in Chicago (we already wasted several hours while waiting), so we discussed with AA staff, they took almost 4 hours and finally they said we have to rebook tickets to next day and they cannot rebook through Qatar but said they can rebook with BA (British Airways) for next day ie. Jan 22nd from Cleveland to Chicago through AA flight and from Chicago to India through BA flight. I agreed for that because we don’t have any other feasible options at that time. On Jan 22nd we were able to flew from Cleveland to Chicago in AA flight but in Chicago BA staff did not allow me to board in BA flight because they said I don’t have unexpired US visa (I already have H4 approval petition but don’t have unexpired US visa and already scheduled for visa appointment in India). I did not know that I need a visa to travel in BA and AA staff who changed our entire itinerary (it supposed to be with Qatar Airways but changed to BA) never told us about visa restrictions with BA even though we spent 4 hours in their counter while standing. BA staff were very rude in Chicago, did not help us in any way. I was worried about what happens next and how to take care of my 4 months old son and my mother who does not speak English, more over Chicago is not my home town and don’t know anyone there. Then I got an idea to meet with Qatar staff because Qatar Airways was my original airline, wanted to give a try, then my fate changed entirely. I encountered with Qatar Airways staff and my experience with them was wonderful and they rebooked our tickets with the Qatar flight which will be starting with in 40 minutes from Chicago without asking for single penny.  Qatar Airways staff acted very fast, cleared all formalities within minutes and believe it or not within 30 minutes we were in the flight. I still cannot believe how Qatar Airways staff helped us, the way they treated us, cleared everything in minutes and handled the situation especially when we need a help very badly and with very bad experience earlier with other airlines (AA and BA) even though we approached them in last minute. I am very much thankful to Qatar Airways staff otherwise I would have suffered a lot especially with my 4 months old son and my mother, both completely depends on me. I wanted to take some time to put all my experiences, that’s why I am putting little bit late review."

I saw the ticket agent physically deflate when my large piece of luggage came in under the weight requirements. Their luggage handling is infuriating. The 10 across seating in the 777 economy is offering narrow 17"" wide seats. Seat recline is better than most, which can cut both ways - comfortable for sleeping, but if the person in front of you reclines the entire flight, you won't have room to work on your laptop. That doesn't matter much as the 777s don't have wifi. The entertainment choices are excellent, but the screens are old, tired, unintuitive, and not particularly responsive. The flight tracking maps are useless, flashing from a screen showing an ad to a screen showing the pitch of the aircraft, to a sparse map written in only Arabic. To give credit where it's due, they mostly nail the food. Three entree choices, and enough on your tray to constitute a meal. If you're used to US airlines, you'll be pleasantly surprised at the amount and quality of food provided. Finally, the connections at the Doha airport are a special kind of punishment, it's a massive facility filled with every high end retailer in the world. I wouldn't go too far out of my way to avoid Qatar Airways, but they've been gliding on their grammatically painful world five star airline motto for far too long."

This was at 6am, she eventually got hold of her supervisor who came over and said the visa was fine. Any questions I asked where answered with ""Thats just the way it is"" again and again. Eventually they checked me in, but they were so rude, I don't understand why they were unpleasant. It was the strangest of experiences, in a bad way. In over 20 years of travelling this was the most unpleasant check-in experience I have had."

Crews were helpful and a staff from the Ft Lauderdale office provided me hotel accommodation in Doha for a layover due to the changes that they made on my flight schedule. Some airlines would let you stay at the airport to wait for the next flight and provide you with no assistance at all. With the flight from Doha to Manila, crew was very organized. I would rate this airline highly. Keep up providing good service to customers!"

Reliable airline, punctual flights, world class service, good drinks, poor food with no diversity, small portions, clean, newer aircrafts. Good lounge in Doha with slumber rooms. Luggage transferred with high precision. Terrible bus-gating in Doha: have to walk inside the airport for almost 2 km, for them just to board by taking a bus drive for another 3 km: why don’t they then bus people from the central area and drive all 5 km instead of letting everybody walk 2 km first? Elite status respected: staff were very respectful and advising. Very expensive ticket, double price as compared to competing carriers on this route (like ET and KQ). Due to the Arab ban on Qatar, a huge deroute from DOH to East Africa was undertaken to avoid flying over Saudi-Arabia. It consumes 2 hours extra travel. Another 2 hours was added for an un-announced stop in Entebbe. Altogether the flight became a full day flight while it should have been ½ day flight. Will change carrier next time but accepted this price to retain flyer status at their FFP. Lousy and expensive WiFi offered on-board with lots of patronising registration and information requirements. Charity collection “Educate a Child” is widely announced, intrusive and useless: they still claim to help 58 million uneducated children as they also did 5 years ago. So obviously no progress, have the collections gone into the drain?"

Service is always good with online check-in to beat the queues in many airports. A little more expensive than other airlines in the region, but they fly point to point rather than hubs and transfers, which I prefer. Online services good as is their loyalty programme, although you need to progress to the next tier first before you get anything. Generous baggage and seating space on aircraft is good, although the aisle is narrow and passengers not looking where they are going can easily hit other seated passengers with their bags. Cabin crew are superb and helpful, and if you get them a box of chocolates for the journey they are genuinely pleasantly pleased. The food is normally good as is the choice of beverages on offer. The entertainment system has some good movies, but often has problems working properly. Customer services is absolutely awful, with many queries not answered or the staff point you to the webpage information where you said you didn't understand what was on the page."

Walter Bertschinger",,20th January 2018,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Zurich via Doha,December 2017,1.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,,4,no,6,"  I used Qatar Airways for the fourth time late in 2016, on the route Zurich – Bangkok – Zurich, in economy class. On previous flights, I had twice tried to sign on to Qatar's frequent flyer programme, but somehow this did not work out. I had wanted to deposit my need for an aisle seat, as I have a back injury which requires me to get up frequently. On the flight from Doha to Bangkok I was assigned a seat with which there was something wrong. I requested that I be allowed to change the seat, explaining that I might get problems, but was told that this was impossible as the plane was full. In Bangkok, I had to request another passenger to lift my luggage off the belt at the airport.  I needed to leave Bangkok eight days earlier than booked. The ticket I had bought stated that I would be charged 173 Swiss francs for any change of reservation, but when I tried to make the change online, the cost was given as 355 Swiss francs. I called the Qatar office in Bangkok. They confirmed that this was a mistake, ""probably a software problem“, and then proceeded to charge me 202 Swiss francs. I was told that I was charged more because my change of reservation had to made manually. To me, this is not five star."

J Deerlin",,15th January 2018,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Melbourne to Geneva via Doha,January 2018,2.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3,no,4,"  Melbourne to Geneva  via Doha and Marrakesh to Melbourne on return. Despite good ground service in Geneva and Marrakesh, service was shocking in Qatar. Despite arriving into Qatar from Melbourne with an hour to spare we were not able to board the flight due to their systems. Continued confusion at the airport (after queuing for 20 minutes) meant we were told 3 times we would make the flight, only to be told in the end that we could not. They did re-route us via Geneva and London to Edinburgh, but then there was not enough time for the required connection (this was always going to be impossible). So again we had to re-route, this time via a different London flight and on to Aberdeen instead. Our 22 hour journey ended up being through 5 airports, 42 hours long and we didn't manage to have time for one lounge due to all the continued queuing and waiting. As a shorty (5ft 1) the headrests are badly designed. They push my head forward uncomfortably as they don't go low enough. At least the staff got me extra blankets to sit on, which really did help my neck a lot but was not the comfiest for my bum. There is no foot rest, again a problem for me being short. I tried to use my own Bose headphones with a 2 pin adapter as I do on most flights but with only 4 volume settings and the volume down to its lowest it was unbearably loud. I asked for a headset and got through 4 headsets, not one worked properly. One ear only would work on 3 pairs and with the other it was a robotic sound and I could not hear properly. I ended up using my own headphones but only half on my ears. My handset flashed the entire journey which was very offputting. They tried to re-set it 3 times, but it did not help. For one of the legs I was in an exit row and the handsets are next to your hip which meant I kept pressing the buttons without meaning to, interrupting my movie by randomly selecting a game for example. Food and drink I cannot fault - probably the best airline food I've had in economy. Cabin staff service: was much better than ground staff, very amicable and helpful."

Crew kept toilets clean throughout flight. Landed late and parked at remote stand. Transit security was easy at Doha. Lounge is beautiful but signage inside was poor. Odd that the main showers are located behind the dining area. Had to ask staff several times for location. Doha to CMB left on time.

Between HK to DOH route, an A350 was deployed, a new beautiful aircraft, very comfortable seat which turn into flat bed. Between DOH to Vienna they use B737, it was just equally as comfortable. Nothing was compromised at all. The transfer in Doha was very smooth and easy, I loved their beautiful and spacious lounge, truly a place to relax.

Food quality and flight entertainment were excellent, as well as choice of beverages (soft drinks, and juices - not interested in alcoholic drinks as I do not consume them!). During the flight a problem arose with the passenger at the front fully reclining his seat. In spite of my polite requests not to fully recline, he became rude and we started arguing. Cabin staff intervened, first with no success, as the guy became abusive towards me and my wife. The head of cabin crew then intervened successfully. We started talking and explained to me airline procedures relating to this sort of situation. At some stage he held a briefing with cabin crew on all flight events and relevant procedures as well as closing the day. I submitted a written commendation regarding cabin crew professionalism on handling of this sort of situation. Really amicable - well done!"

After a 10 hour flight on the Boeing 777-300 I was looking forward to comparing both cabins. I have to say that even tho the A350 is one of my favorite aircrafts because of how much quieter it is and the external camera views that give you a sense of extra safety and peace of mind, I wish the seats were like the ones on the triple seven. The capsule made me feel a bit claustrophobic not to mention that you completely feel far apart from your traveling companion. On the Boeing 777 we were side by side, talking, eating and just loving the flight, on the A350 we felt apart so much so that because the cabin was not full we chose an isle and a window seat (the hallway was between us) but we felt closer. I think Qatar is aware of this and the new Q-Suites will fix this for couples or families that travel together. The tray table is located in a place that during the sleep portion of my 14 hour flight I found myself hitting my knees often. I felt shelled in and at times it was not comfortable. The A350 also has a mini stand in lounge that none used during the flight except for me to actually stretch during portions of the flight. The crew also looked as if they were working with less space than in the triple seven. Qatar’s service is the best in the industry so these things I point out just in comparison with the previous equipment flown. I also have to mention that because the same crew had double the passengers to serve they did not spend as much time with you as they did on my previous flight. One thing that is unique to Qatar is their business class affordability if they have the seats to sell the upgrade. On other airlines even if they have the seats they don’t give you the opportunity to pay for an upgrade. I booked this 14 hour flight coach and upgraded for $850.00 and trust me the superior service is worth it alone. Qatar has become my airline of choice for international travel."

Qatar airlines is bringing back the glamour and romance of air travel. This flight was 10 hours and we loved every minute of it. You can eat anything from the menu when you want and the crew’s attention to detail and genuine friendliness is what makes it all worth it. I prefer the Boeing 777 business cabin over the A350 because you can sit next to your traveling partner, there’s less people so the crew really take their time to serve you and attend to your every need plus in my opinion the seat feels a lot more roomier. The check in at the Manila airport was not done by Qatar staff and it was mediocre at best. It felt like I was checked in by robots. This is something that needs to improve. On flights under 10 hours you do not get the pajamas or bed turndown service but despite this I still think Qatar is worthy of their number 1 ranking and is currently the best airline, period."

M Gallian",A350,12th December 2017,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Doha,December 2017,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,5,yes,10," I would like to begin this review by agreeing that Qatar by far is the best airline I have ever flown. The experience on board in economy was the best I have ever had. In this review I have also attached some photos because there is not too much information about economy and you need to know that if you’re considering flying this airline please do so because you will not regret it. The seats are comfortable, the food is very good, the entertainment is also very good but the service is outstanding. The seats in coach have plenty of legroom and this aircraft with the interior LED lighting system, the larger than standard windows, and the quiet engines made this 10 hour flight from Philadelphia to Doha very comfortable. The only thing I must point out is that unfortunately the check in at the Philadelphia airport is not done by Qatar personnel instead by a company that does check in for multiple airlines therefore the experience is not so pleasant, in my opinion this is not fair for the airline because it makes the job of the crew on board more difficult. I will do a separate review about the airport in Doha with detailed information. I have to say that the A350 is probably the best aircraft in the market and Qatar by far the best airline in service, comfort, safety, and value for the money paid. My favorite feature of the A350 has to be the external camera views. Qatar is simply changing the way we fly and I’ll fly with them as often as I can and you should to."

Smooth transit in Bangkok, flight on time. They use airbridges and one just walk into (and off) the aircraft directly. QR Lounge in BKK has not yet opened after 6 months delay. Boarding smooth, greeted and allowed to move to a better seat. Food poor, a kind of coated hot sandwich offered. Upon complaining, they found an excellent, additional sandwich as alternative (Hindu-meal: salmon sandwich), which was good. Wine and drinks offered, only one brand of each – it used to be at least two of each. A new annoying charity collection on education has started and is announced for Minutes. Miles instated instantly."

V Meier","A330-200, A380",10th December 2017,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Venice to Bangkok via Doha,December 2017,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4,yes,8," Flew Venice to Bangkok via Doha with Qatar Airways. As usual extraordinary service and food. On second leg the purser did not came by to greet by name, a flow in service level, the rest very very good! The seat on the A380 are very good a 1-2-1 configuration with plenty of privacy. The A330-200 was reconfigured with the new 2-2-2 configuration, which lacks a bit foot space in laying flat position (only first row has generous foot space). But nevertheless a decent product."

S Buekrenger",,9th December 2017,Business,Economy Class,Sydney to Doha,November 2017,,,,,1.0,,1,no,1,"  My flight from Sydney to Doha (connecting to Munich) got cancelled due to technical issues after we were sitting in the airplane at the gate for 3 hours. I had to stand in line for another 3 hours to get a hotel for the night. Airport staff took my contact details and I was promised to get informed by the airline about the new departure time. As the airport staff ran out of taxi vouchers, we had to pay for our own taxi to the hotel and were promised to be payed back the next day. I was never informed by any Qatar staff about my new departure time. As the airplane was still broken the next day they had to rebook us on different flights. I had to spend 2,5 hours on the phone to a call centre agent in India who rebooked me on a different routing. At the airport I was not able to claim my taxi money back. After arriving with 20 hour delay in Munich I went to the Qatar Airways office to claim my taxi money back and was given a sheet of paper with an email address where I should write my claim to. I wrote my claim and never got an answer or any money back. After calling the Call centre again, I was told this time that the email address was wrong. So who knows if I will ever be reimbursed. Not even speaking about any other compensation. "

It was a pleasant flight for us with this airline. Departure and arrival were on time. The food was above average and drinks were distributed in sufficient quantities. The seat distances corresponded to the international standard. Unfortunately, the airline has probably grown too fast. This is evident in the service of the on-board staff. Some appear, especially with the Asian flight attendants, uneffective and a better instruction or training would be desirable."

Simon Smith",A380 and 777,6th December 2017,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Paris to Perth via Doha,November 2017,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,,5,yes,5,"  Paris to Perth via Doha. We had a very mixed experience with Qatar Airways. The outward journey to Perth was excellent - the seating is very comfortable (better on the A380 than the 777), food was great, and there's a good range of entertainment. Changing planes in Doha was easy although a small issue was that the business class lounge doesn't have enough showers to meet the demand, and we had to wait quite a long time. However, our return journey from Sydney on 19 November was a disaster. We were on the cancelled flight that another passenger has posted about, and I can confirm that Qatar's handling of the situation was chaotic. Once finally off the plane, despite being almost at the front of the queue, we had to wait two hours before we got sent to a hotel. We were told we would be called or emailed with details of a new flight, but we weren't, and all through the next morning it was impossible to get through to their call centre in Australia, and all of the others seemed to be closed. Around lunchtime, another passenger I spoke to advised me to check under manage booking on the website; when I did, to my surprise I found I had been booked on a flight via Beijing in less than an hour, and never told. By the time we got to check in, we'd missed that. There were no Qatar staff at the airport, but eventually we did get through to a call centre, and finally got rerouted on Qantas to London. Qatar has made no effort to contact us since - I'd hope they'd at least refund what we spent on phone calls. I understand technical problems can happen, but an airline needs some sort of contingency plan, and a global 24/7 airline really needs a 24/7 call centre."

Judith Stevens",A380,1st December 2017,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London to Sydney via Doha,November 2017,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,,4,no,5,"  London to Sydney via Doha went without hitch and I was happy with the seat, service, lounge etc and would happily have given a 9/10 rating for this airline. However, on the return from SYD to LHR there was a technical problem with the aircraft and after sitting in our seats for two hours the flight was cancelled due to the 11pm curfew at Sydney airport. Total chaos as we had to re-enter immigration, reclaim baggage and pass through customs eventually ending up in the check in area with only four staff members attempting to deal with all 450+ passengers and no separate queue for business and first class passengers. After waiting in line for two hours I was allocated a hotel room and told that Qatar Airways would contact me by telephone with details of onward journey. Finally arrived at hotel at 2.15am. By 10am the following morning I had heard nothing and was due to check out of hotel by 11, together with other passengers who had heard nothing. Numerous calls to the number given for the airline were unanswered and I eventually decided to check my booking online and found that I had been re-booked on a Qantas flight leaving that afternoon. I made my own way to the airport and checked in with no problem but to date, now ten days later, I have had no communication from Qatar Airways. I appreciate that there can be technical difficulties but the total lack of customer service is not what one expects from an airline."

The new sandwiches bar at Al Mourjan lounge is very good but the same moment they stopped the a la carte menu on the second floor restaurant, it is now a self service buffet, but previous restaurant was unique among all business class lounge.  Yes they offer a pre flight booking service, but this is not the book to cook service. Only selection is from the menu of the given flight. On my case, there was not any dinner served, only a sandwich selection, so I had sandwich on the lounge and then sandwich on the plane. Last time I flew a year ago, with the same flight, there was full dinner service. There were not pyjamas on my size and they gave me the biggest they had, a medium/large which I did not use. At least the personnel and the chief crew member were very good. Very efficient and provided very good service beyond expectations, so I have to congratulate them and the airline for their training."

Craig Gardiner",A380 / A350 / Boeing 787,28th November 2017,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Melbourne to Oslo via Doha,November 2017,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5,yes,10,"  Melbourne to Oslo via Doha, returning from London. I flew on 3 different aircraft with Qatar's business class product and all were consistently amazing. My wife and I flew on the A380 from Melbourne to Doha, the Boeing 787 onto Oslo and A350 out of London before connecting on the A380 back into Melbourne. The 787 was the smallest of Business class but this did not impact the standard or level of service and the seat layout of 1x2x11 is almost identical to the other aircraft. The A350 is about double the size and the A380 would be double that again. 3 out of our 4 flights were overnight and therefor we were able to utilise the lay flat beds, pajamas and noise cancelling headphones to their full advantage. The cabin crew are happy to convert your seat into a bed whilst you get changed in the bathroom. Branded amenity kits are provided. The a la carte menu on all flights was different and you have a wide range of beers and spirits along with a comprehensive international wine and champagne list. First and Business class passengers have the option of boarding first and can enjoy a glass of bubbles .. or two before take off whilst the rest of the plane boards. The A380 also offers the inflight lounge or bar that is for use of First and Business passengers -  it allows you a separate space to socialise. There is an impressive cocktail list and a variety of canapes and snacks available too. I can honestly say that I have never experienced such a comfortable flight and the 14 hours to Doha and further 6 hours to Europe went far too quickly. I didn't want to get off the plane. Onboard wifi is available too - 15 mins free or more at a cost if required. The entertainment on board was great and I didn't run out of things to watch or listen too."

I have flown in Qatar business class cabin before but this is the first time I flew with the latest business class cabin in the Boeing 787. The seat is excellent with ample storage. I managed to take a nap in relatively 'short' long haul flight. The lighting and temperature were good enough to let me taking my nap. There were a lot of options for the IFE and the quality of screen was excellent. The food was also great as always. The service from the crews from the start of journey until the end of the trip was above average. I think they deserve to be the best airline.

P Haime",Boeing 787,24th November 2017,Family Leisure,Business Class,Barcelona to Hong Kong via Doha,September 2017,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1,no,1,"  Barcelona to Hong Kong return via Doha in business class, and I decided to add my children to the trip (to travel in economy class) about two weeks before the departure. Qatar Airways website would not sell me a ticket for them, so I called their call centre and they were happy to sell me two return economy tickets for my 4 and 7 year old. On arrival at check in at Barcelona the staff realised that the tickets I had been sold for the children were illegal because the younger of the two children was under 5, which they told me is the minimum age on that airline for travel in a cabin separate from the parents. As the flight was leaving in two hours I was offered two alternatives: to downgrade myself to economy with the children with no compensation, or pay the airport upgrade price for them to travel with me in business, which I did because the staff at BCN believed Qatar would refund me as the mistake was theirs. On the return trip from HKG the check in staff had no problem with the children travelling in economy and me in business and the return trip was far easier. I was astounded by the mistakes and three months later, Qatar is still refusing me any refund or any form of compensation for the money I was forced, apparently needlessly, to spend on the outward journey so that the children could travel with me in business class. I am shocked at the inconsistency between its rules applied on check-in in Barcelona and Hong Kong outstations."

Baggage check-in process was simple and easy.  Meal preferences was good - I'm a vegetarian and on the onward journey forgot to specify the meal preference but the crew had enough inventory to meat the requirements. Every seat was provided with a small plastic pouch/packet/goodie bag that consisted of a eye mask, pair of sock, toothpaste+brush, hand cream. This was very useful and effective. Entertainment options were good and current.  Online check-in wasn't easy; towards the end of the process, there is an option to email the boarding pass but this never worked for me.  It would have been good, as part of the online check-in, if the users reminded to specify the meal preferences, etc. I forgot to specify the meal preferences but thankfully the crew had enough of what I wanted. Seats were the worst part - poor legroom.  ATL to DOH leg was the worst (and the longest leg of the trip), comfort wise, I would rate as the worst. Luckily on the return leg (DOH-ATL) next two seats to mine was empty, so was able to stretch and sleep well. DOH-MAA vv seating was little better, think its a older plane; newer planes have worst seats. Food was ok dinner and lunch but minimalistic. There was no alert or reminder of upcoming trip via email or text, etc. "

You are immediately overwhelmed by the luxury this new suite has to offer. We fly as a couple and when we were seated they lowered the blind in between the two seats so you immediately felt that you had your own private compartment. We were receiving a refreshment drink to our choice before take off. After take-off you can close the doors on your suite and then it really feels like you are in a private room on an airplane. The seats have many modification possibilities, even a real double bed feature. My wife fell in love with the blankets who were especially designed for this new q-suite, they feel so nice. The in-flight entertainment set provides a very big bright screen and the latest hollywood blockbusters available. The cabin crew was so nice to us, they really made this trip even more special by the way they treated us. I had pre-ordered an asian vegetarian meal but the flight attendant looked through the menu with me to see if i changed my menu to what i preferred most. It was no problem to switch the desert and main course since it looked more appetising to me. The food was really good. Even with ordering some snacks they explained everything what was on the menu and recommended the size of portions i ordered. It was really an amazing experience and we never thought we were kinda disappointed that the 6:30hr flight was over."

Departed on time and again food served within an hour of departure, the flight went quickly, great service, food was good for economy. The aircraft is great, very comfortable. Arrived on time with bags waiting once through immigration. the best 2 economy flights I have had for many years. Clean aircraft, great crew, good food and great value for this trip.

First flight Durban to Doha left on time. Crew were good, had a one hour stop in Johannesburg for refueling and picking up passengers. IFE is very good. Main meal was good although the portions these days are extremely small. All drinks including water are served in small plastic cups. Plenty of drink runs were made throughout the flight. Only disappointment was the breakfast, some sort of snack wrap which was awful. Stockholm to Durban was delayed once we were all on board and ready to take-off. Not the airlines fault, there was a medical problem with one of the passengers so we parked and medics were called. It meant we missed our connection in Doha, As we came off the plane there was our name on a board, the ground crew had our new boarding passes and vouchers for a hotel, very officiant! Beautiful 5 star hotel (even for economy class passengers) far better than the one Emirates uses in Dubai. Very generous meal allowance of $180 per person, couldn't even spend it all. I have flown with all three Gulf airlines and have to say Qatar Airways is by a long mile the best. PS - $380 return Durban / Stockholm on a 24 hour special, unbelievable."

In DOH I was told that even with a First ticket you could not take a guest with you, even though he was on a business ticket. A380 back to LHR, the difference between Qatar’s business and first is the seat. The cabin was spacious and the seat did make a comfortable bed, but no pjamas offered and no mattress cover, only a meager thin blanket con this daytime flight. Food was the same as business , nothing special. Free wifi provided was very patchy. Took a trip to the bar to see it as had been told was worth a look, and it was but very busy, so retreated back to my seat. Crew on this flight were a delight, CSD was professional but friendly and the other crew were a joy! Much better standard than on the way out. Personally I don’t think first class is worth the price with Qatar difference with in business."

The service onboard is fabulous. However on this flight to Paris - Bangkok - Doha and then Doha - Paris, I noticed a few things which should be improved. Check-in in Bangkok could be better and more classy. Business check-in was a bit too laid back. In Bangkok, Qatar uses Thai Airways Business lounge. It is a great lounge but some privileges are not accessible to Qatar business class passengers, massages for instance. Onboard, it was great however the selection of wines was better a few years ago. For instance, Pol Roger rosé was a better Champagne than Lanson."

Very pleasant staff. Only 150 pax so three seats each. Superb service throughout. Aircraft was delayed due to air traffic at LHR. But arrived on time. Only disappointment was the food. Not up to the normal Qatar standards. But cabin crew were very attentive. Its the attitude of the crew that make a real difference. Overall a very pleasant experience.

T Pecking",,8th November 2017,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Atlanta via Doha,October 2017,2.0,2.0,1.0,,2.0,,2,no,2,"  Bangkok to Atlanta via Doha. I had 6 meals on this trip, sampled the first, picked at the second and third and just looked at the rest to see if there were any positive changes. Only one time did the attendant came by to pick up used cups, napkins. Since I had a window seat, I did not feel like squeezing past the aisle seat and walking my garbage down to the galley. They were good about handing out water - just not about collecting it. A340 had the shortest legroom I have experienced, my seat back was short and uncomfortable and the bathroom nearest me ran out of water early into the flight. I needed Wi-Fi from DOH to ATL but they did not offer any. "

D Keeler",,8th November 2017,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Manchester to Auckland via Doha,October 2017,4.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,4,no,8,"  Manchester to Auckland via Doha legs seemed to be older planes, with seats in pairs rather than singles on an angle. Food was okay. I was looking forward to a cold beer but only 2 options of lager which is my last resort. The staff were all very attentive. Return flight Auckland to Doha had same pod set up which was again disappointing. The Doha to MAN leg actually had a newer plane, quieter and with individual pods - significantly better all round. I'm quite tech savvy but their in flight viewing control system remained a mystery to me, I managed to watch stuff but it wasn't particularly intuitive. On the last leg on the newer plane I had the problem of not being able to turn the headphone volume down enough, changing headphone set made no difference. Ended up having to have the headphone half open on my ears to reduce the volume. No one else seemed to have an issue. "

Checked in on line and choose seat a for both myself and my partner, bag drop at LHR T4 quick and polite security was very quick at 11am on a Thursday morning, was given access to the Skyteam lounge with my oneworld status? Qatar never offer there own lounge to FF but I guess it is advised in the rules. Anyway Skyteam lounge is pretty comfortable so fine. Boarded through gate A6 it was all very quick on to a newish clean A380 seats 31A & 31B on the upper deck.. Departed on time the flight wasn't full so a pretty nice atmosphere on board. Lunch served shortly after airborne was actually very nice lots of drinks offered during the flight with a hot sandwich tra coffee served about an hour before arrival. Had 3 hours in Doha which was a pleasant time visiting the shops onyx lounge and a walk around. Boarding the DOH-NRT flight from D22 via a bus however it wasn't too bad. The aircraft was spotless and strangely almost empty so while we had assigned seats we actually sat where we wanted with all but about 20 seats in the last cabin almost free. Departed on time again once airborne breakfast served quickly. I then slept across 4 seats for 6 hours once awake was offered coffee before I guess pre landing dinner which was okay but not as good as the previous flight. Landed on time after 9hrs 30min the whole trip was longer but much better than my usual BA. I have used QR about 20 times now in both business & economy. Economy upper deck on the A380 is difficult to beat. My first time on the 777-300ER with 3-4-3 seating and pleased it was pretty empty because I can imagine it would be pretty cramped when full."

As a 5-star airline I expected high things from Qatar Airways. Whilst my experience was perfectly adequate, I wasn't overwhelmed. The terminal they use at Manchester Airport couldn't be further from the train station, and Economy check-in was pretty average. Flight and food were fine. Staff quite attentive. Doha Airport looked fantastic but organisationally it was a bit haphazard. Having also flown to Seoul with Lufthansa from Manchester and with British Airways from Leeds Bradford, my only reason to choose Qatar in future would be a cheaper fare."

On this trip I enjoyed the older 777 layout and entertainment system over the so called state of the art 787-8 which had hard seats that hurt my shoulder with very little privacy. The entertainment system on the outbound flight was ok but on the 787 was very difficult to operate. Food on both flights was less than average, the encrusted chicken tasted awful and even worse was my choice of appetizer on the return flight, the Arabic Mezze which I missed was dropped by the cabin attendant and it was the last one. I had to miss that and even the ice cream was out, I just did not know what I had paid for."

Even after I spoke with Duty Officer and explained I need to be at work tomorrow, they didn't help. My original tickets were for Business Class from Baku and First Class from Doha, but when I came to Airport for a flight booked for me, staff issued me Economy Class ticket for my flight from Doha. When I asked why, they said the QA system now shows Economy Class. It took me some time to prove that my original cancelled flight was for First class. I decided to speak with the Manager in Baku airport and she advised me to write to Customer Care.  Senior Customer Care Officer said that the only thing they can do for me is issue a USD250 voucher to use in the future and this is the only option she can give me. "

The seat layout is 2-2-2 instead of 1-2-1. The entertainment system proved slow/inconvenient and is not comparable to Qatar's own aircraft. The service was very slow and partially disorganized. This resulted e.g. in no drinks being served together with the meal. They have cut down on the menu choices compared to previous flights. Both the starter as well as the main course were tasteless.  All in all, this was a huge disappointment."

Business class is really great especially on the Doha to New York Sector. Almost every few seats have a dedicated stewardess who pampers you all throughout the 12-13 hours. My biggest disappointment was they overbooked the flight from Doha to Chennai and upgraded several Economy passengers to Business. I have no worries with that and have been lucky myself several times. However, Qatar has to be sensitive to Business travellers who prefer to travel alongside other serious business travellers and not passengers who are noisy and get tipsy halfway through the flight. Will stop flying Business on Qatar if they don't profile passengers before upgrading them to higher class of travel."

Qatar Airways went beyond expectations when dealing with my luggage enroute to South Africa from Toronto with a transfer in Philly. Upon my arrival in Doha, I was called to the gate desk so they could ensure my luggage went on the plane with me. I've never experienced this before with any other airline. On my return overnight flight back from JoBurg, I accidentally left a package in the overhead bin. The manager at the transfer desk personally arranged for that package to be brought immediately from the plane, which was parked far away from the actual terminal building, to me so I could take it on my connecting flight to Chicago. My connection was tight but they made it happen... AND changed my seat allocation so I could have 3 seat empty seats for my transatlantic flight. Every interaction I had during my long 28+hour journeys was exemplary service. Qatar wins my vote hand down."

I booked two round trips with Qatar Airways, one for Sept 25 to October 23rd and one for November 5th to Dec 17th. We are Gold Privilege members (only relevant for the lack of care shown for a frequent business class traveller). On October 22nd, the day before my flight, I went online to on Qatar's website to check my seat selection was still valid. I hadn't received any notifications by text, email or via the Qatar app on my phone, yet online, there was a warning box showing that my itinerary had been changed. I had been bumped from the quick connection (1 hour 10m) in Doha onto a flight which left an hour and a half later. My arrival time at LHR would now be 10pm instead of 8.25pm; a real inconvenience for me. As it was Sunday afternoon in Bali, there was no office open to call and ask why the change. I tried the London and Doha offices; both were closed. The flight I had been bumped off was still being advertised online as being available to book, but I could do nothing, so I spent an hour making arrangements involving costly calls to the UK from Bali. I checked in early the next day and asked at the desk to put me back on the original flight. At first, the desk staff said they could not help me and I'd have to speak to the transfer desk in Doha, but once the question of which flight my bag would be checked to, came up (with me refusing to allow it to be on the later flight),  they were able to check me on to the earlier flight. I lost all my seat selections with a change of aircraft, and ended up on the undesirable window seats on both legs of the 777-300. The stewardess told me that the aircraft was changed 3 weeks before the flight; again, there was no notification about the change and that my allocated seats were no longer available. Neither of my two legs had internet on board. My arrival in Doha was delayed by half an hour so I had 40 minutes, along with 21 other passengers, to get to the next flight. We made it easily; however, I deeply regret getting onboard for the following: The mystery of being bumped was solved; much of the aircraft's business class section was occupied by a local family along with their appallingly behaved children of various ages. For 7 hours, non-stop, we were bombarded by toddlers running around or screaming to each other across rows of seats, by their staff running in and out of economy trying to control the children, by people swapping seats constantly and by members of the family bringing more toddlers and babies from other cabins to socialise. This wasn't a business class experience; it was being in a creche for a day. The cabin crew were beside themselves with trying to control the situation.  A complaint raised yesterday received a reply quoting terms and conditions only, so we will take our business elsewhere."

Qatar use the Escape lounges at Manchester which now has a separate business lounge with hot meal options. The flight was 40 minutes late departing from Manchester and as I only had one hour transit in Doha I was concerned about getting my connection, the cabin crew were very supportive and kept checking the likely arrival time and explained if I missed my flight there was another Bangkok flight not long afterwards, they found out the gate number of my flight and made sure I was the first person off the aircraft. Flight was excellent, seats comfortable even for passengers of my height I've always considered the food on Qatar to be the best with lots of choice a decent choice of entertainment on the video channels. I did make my connection but it was a bit tight. Outgoing flights were on  A330 / A340 while returning aircraft's were Boeing 777 / 787. In my opinion little to choose between them although the 787 has the best seating 1x2x1, all aircraft's had been changed since I first booked, not a huge problem apart from having to forever change your preferred seat on the Qatar website. Being able to pre-order your main meal in advance was new although it's only on flights from Doha at present. Outstanding flight crews on all four flights, friendly and attentive to your needs a credit to Qatar Airways. Due to short transit time didn't have time to visit the business class lounge at Hamad International Airport although I did manage a short time there on my flight home. Similar experience at Bangkok, early check-in for flights and fast track through passport control the new Qatar lounge isn't open yet so still using one or other of two Thai Airways lounge noticed they've removed the TV screen since me previous visit which only ever had CNN. Still the world's best airline by far with the finest staff on the ground and in the air."

I had the worst experience with staff at Doha Airport. I chose a flight with a longer transit in between, so I could see Doha with a complimentary tour of Doha. I landed just in time to make it to their evening tour, which is the last tour of the day. I had about 45 min before the tour starts, so as soon as I landed, I quickly made my way to the immigration, and headed out. When I was out, I was looking for the location of the desk, where it says it’s at concourse B. I managed to find WH Smith, but there was no desk close by. I went to the information desk and asked where to find this tour, the lady told me it’s before immigration. I know I was running out of time, it wouldn’t make sense for me to go back to the other side and come back out again. Therefore I asked the lady if she could call the tour desk for me, to let them know I was waiting outside. The lady was not helpful at all, she was unwilling to call for me. I asked her what option do I have if I want to join the tour, she said I have to go back in to join the tour. So I followed her advice and went back in. Before I went back in, I spoke to 2 other staff, I told them the reason I was out, and the reason I had to go back inside, they just said ‘ok’ and pointed towards the security and immigration to me. I wanted to make sure I can actually go back inside and come back out again afterwards. Since 2 people I’ve asked said ok, I thought it would be ok. By the time I got back in, I finally found his desk for the tour. There was a closed sign at the desk, but I went to speak to the lady there, she told me I was too late, they cannot add me to the tour group any more.  She told me to come back the next day. My connecting flight was early morning, I would be gone by then!  I saw an information desk about Doha, so I went over, and asked for some information if I wanted to go out myself (the only helpful and friendly guy I’ve spoken to during my time at the Doha Airport!) I’ve got all the information I need, including a map, so I was ready to go through immigration to head out again on my own this time. However, immigration did not let me through, they said I already used my one time visa, so I can’t go out again. "

She was a little dazed but seemed to have gotten similar reaction in the past. No one at the airport was very responsive either."

After an hour delay on the ground in Melbourne we finally took off resulting in us having an hour to swap planes in Doha, which is fine. Doha is very easy to navigate and the staff makes every effort to speed you through the security check. Once we landed in Stockholm we went to collect our luggage however after waiting for half an hour it was announced om the speakers that our luggage was lost. We rushed to get this sorted as we were on our way to a wedding, QR said they'd do everything they could to deliver the luggage by the morning, however nothing ever arrived, we ended up missing the wedding, with no change of clothes and still no information about compensation. It is now a week later and we still don't have our luggage, a missed wedding and a ruined holiday spent worrying and on the phone without any help or contact from Qatar Airways. we have been given so many numbers and email addresses however no one ever responds and when you get in touch with customer service they just refer you to ground staff instead of giving any help.

Originally booked this flight for the Boeing 787 operating it but about 4 weeks before departure noticed that it was now an A330, no problem as I like the A330. Check in at Manchester was very good, the ladies on Business class were fast and very funny and it was an enjoyable experience. The business class lounge was a disappointment. The plane had the new style seats fitted - in my opinion these are not as good as the old seats. Sitting in the window seat with the passenger in the aisle seat fully reclined, it needs mountaineering skills to get to the aisle. Also, the window seat has very restricted room for your feet when fully reclined. The IFE was OK but I struggled to find anything that I really wanted to watch. By far the worst aspect (and this applies to Emirates A380 too) was the almost total lack of room for your elbows, you are very restricted. The cabin service on the outbound flight was superb, the food was good and the provision of non alcoholic Champagne is very welcome to any teetotallers travelling. On the return journey the check in was superb and very efficient. The business class lounge was crowded and there was a queue for the toilets but they were kept clean. The plane was again fitted with the new seating arrangements and again I prefer the old style but the general cabin appearance gives a feeling of space. Cabin service again was very good and you got the feeling that nothing was too much trouble. Food was OK and was well presented. On both flights, the toilets were kept very clean and stocked with toothbrushes and toiletries. All in all a totally different experience from the last time I travelled with Qatar, the cabin crew were exceptionally good."

Cabin service was excellent with the dine on demand feature welcome, we had eaten in Doha airport so weren't too hungry on the way out. Seats were comfortable with room to get round the fully reclined seat of neighbouring passenger. Plenty of leg and arm room and the food and drink on offer was good. Managed to sleep for part of the journey and enjoyed the flight. The return journey was also very good with excellent service from the cabin services director. Due to feeling unwell I did not take any food but was kept well supplied with water by the cabin crew. On both flights the toilets were kept very clean and well stocked. Both flights departed on time, although when leaving Bali we were delayed at the runway access for 20 minutes waiting for an incoming flight. On this experience I would recommend Qatar Airways."

Flights faultless and on time. Check-in efficient. Travelled 1-way economy, previously denied upgrade to business as “no seats” available. However, they try to sell the business seats or upgrade for cash until last day. Eventually, at check-in, I upgraded to business class for miles (“Q-credits”). This was easy, and I had only to wait 5 Minutes until the flight manager could confirm that the appropriate food could be availed within this short notice of only 2½ hours. It worked out and I signed a form to deduct Q-credits from my FFP programme. In Copenhagen QR uses Aspire, a third party lounge, one of the poorest lounges – no hot food, poor drinks etc. Boarding was easy and quick. At seat, pre-departure soft drinks were drink provided. No pre-departure champagne offered – only for CPH and CDG in Europe champagne is not served pre-departure? Food was so, so and tasteless. Drinks and wine list were excellent, served upon take off with hot nuts and hot towels. New onboard is an Italian beer Peroni, which is quite good and tasty. Guinness, Stella Artois, and Corona have gone. The safety video has improved. The annoying charity collections on Educate a Child goes on, I am puzzled by this. Flight 75% full, in business 7 passengers. Good 4-star Hotel provided free of charge in Doha while waiting in transit (20 hours). This is not available for the very cheapest fares. Al Mourjan lounge in Doha always deliver. I sat in the champagne bar and ordered fish sandwich from the remote sandwich-café. They brought it within 5 Minutes despite the distance is 400 meters. Well done. The bartenders did not have their best day, but the visitors made up for it. I don’t like that some visitors paid tips to lounge staff. DOH-SGN: again upgraded using Q-credits two hours before departure: I did so as I realised that any seatblock would be impossible with only 10 vacant seats left in economy. Flight 95% full. Good FA team onboard, I was treated like a king, got double of everything (2 seats, 2 amenity kits, 2 pyjamas). Crew were very joyful, joking, focused, and in good shape – worked hard throughout the flight. Luggage delivered on the belt in Saigon within a few Minutes.

Flight attendants were responsive and polite. An impressive large selection of movies available and I was able to catch up on some old Hitchcock classics. The food was unmemorable and the lamb dish was salty, the meat chewy. With meals available any time, flight attendants scurried around during much of the flight laying table cloth and cutlery, serving multi course meals and then clearing the table. Comfortable 180 degree seats with massage features. Nice hard shell amenities kit. Ample overhead stow space though hardly any space around your seat to keep your documents, personal electronic device, reading material or eye glasses.

There were several meal options per flight (move snacks, main meal, ice cream snack etc). The toilets and cabin were kept clean and lots of trays of water were served. The leg room was very problematic for me. On the leg from Auckland to Doha the air conditioning was not functioning properly for several hours making it uncomfortably warm during a very long bout of turbulence. From Athens to Doha the meal service was excruciatingly slow and the main meal was inedible. Our row were given the last of three meal choices (Chicken) as they had run out of everything else. The two people next to me complained and they somehow found a pasta and beef meal for them. All of us could not eat more than one fork full of our meals as they were completely dry and overcooked, and tasteless. The media service on the shorter legs was non existent. On the Doha to Auckland routes was okay as long as you don't mind having to see the same adverts in front of every media offering - aimed at residents of Doha. Movies were oddly curated.

Three of us were travelling under two bookings and the online facility was not allowing me to sit with two of my family. Luckily at check-in this was rectified so we were provided with 2 blocks of 3 seats for both legs. The flight was amended out of KUL so we missed the A350 and were changed to QR15 which was 2 hours later into LHR. Both planes left on time. Toilets were clean although water was not draining from the sink hole. Food was good - I had potatoes gratin with random white fish served with the usual roll and some trimmings. The sandwich on serving 2 is not a sandwich but a dough slice. Wine volume has been reduced ( I fly Qatar 2/3 times per year ) and I was given 85 ml on my first serving and 100ml on my second serving. Qatar normally provides 187mm bottles and on a 7 hour leg you always get 3 if you ask. IFE screen was only partially responsive; headset had a loose connection resulting in sporadic audio connection. Seat 18 J was broken so my family was split up. The USB connection did not work so I could not easily charge my phone. The seatbelt sign was on for over 3 hours of leg one so the coffee didn't materialize until I requested it.

At 30 minutes to departure there was no aircraft and no sign of ground agents which was the first sign of a pending problem. After the agents showed up and at around the scheduled departure time, the electronic boards showed a gate change but the gate agents could not confirm it. Eventually, all passengers made their way to the new gate where we were told the plane had a technical issue but it was almost resolved meaning we would board shortly. As minutes ticked away, this story changed multiple times and finally at midnight the station manager showed up to tell all of us that the flight was cancelled. What unfolded after can only be described as pandemonium with 200+ passengers many of which had already missed their connecting flights from Doha demanding answers from the ground agents who seemed to be unable to provide straight answers. All passengers were bussed to nearby hotels and many of us are getting to our destination 24 hours later than planned.

Onboard you will find spotless aircraft, in my case the fabulous A350 between Muscat and Doha and the equally pleasant 787-8 Doha to Edinburgh. You will also experience a crew that are not only efficient but also value you as a passenger. Although I was travelling in Business class both the Muscat - Doha and Doha - Muscat sectors are ticketed in First which allowed me access to the First Class lounge at Doha airport. This far exceeds the lounges offered by BA in both Edinburgh and T5 Heathrow. Both aircraft provided comfortable seating and decent IFE in the ""Oryx One"" system. Food and beverage service is excellent with Qatar offering an ""eat on request"" service which eliminates the requirement of a food cart. Meals are served individually on white linen with proper cutlery and tableware. There was an excellent choice of refreshments to accompany meals and additional snacks and refreshments can be requested throughout the flight. I recognize that Qatar Airways are not the cheapest option but in a ""value for money"" comparison with other available carriers I feel they are a very good choice. I will be booking this years Christmas escape with Qatar Airways. Truly a 5 star airline."

On this flight, the crew were much more experienced, friendly and professional.  On the return flight, check in at Rome was worse than Bangkok. Boeing 787 roomy atmosphere on board all added to a great flight. The seats are very comfortable and felt like an armchair in full recline. The crew on this flight were fantastic.

This time I was lucky to get both legs on the A330-300 so I could avoid the Boeing 777-300 and cramped B787. The A330-300 operates with the rather spacious 2-4-2 seat configuration whereas the B773 is 3-4-3 and the B787 is 3-3-3. As a result you get a much better passenger staff ratio and better service in the A330 compared to the Boeing aircraft. Moreover you get more personal space (33 inch seat pitch and 17.5 inch seat width). On the Boeing 777-300 with 3-4-3 configuration you have to queue at the lavatories struggling to get through the narrow aisles. My suggestion would be to choose the aircraft wisely if you have the option to do that.

D Kurman",,15th August 2017,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Dublin via Doha,August 2017,2.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,,3,no,4,"  Bangkok to Dublin via Doha with a 16hr layover. At the time of booking we contacted Qatar Airways customer service to ask if we could avail of their complimentary hotel stay in the airport for our long layover. We were told that we could avail of this service on the day we arrive in Doha by a customer service representative on the phone. On arrival in Doha today we were told that our fare was promotional and we are not eligible for the hotel, meaning we are stuck in the airport for the next 16hrs. The staff were  unapologetic and offered us no alternatives other than paying for hotels with our own money. The flight was disappointing WITH mediocre food and hard seats. The only staff who were very nice and helpful were at the city tour desks. "

Flew Edinburgh to Melbourne Australia via Doha. The staff on Qatar Airways have to be commended. They work so hard and never seem to stop the whole time and every one of them do so with a smile on their faces. Comfortable flight, food comes non stop with snacks and refreshments in between main meals. This is the second long haul round trip I've had with Qatar and I'll certainly be flying with them again."

Dhamotharan Parthasarathy",,9th August 2017,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Chennai via Doha,August 2017,,,,,1.0,,1,no,1,"  I was scheduled to fly yesterday from Atlanta to Chennai via Doha. After all check-in, security clearance process, I was informed that the flight is cancelled while boarding. They didn't send any notifications to mobile or email. They said we need to rebook for next available flight and asked us to check out all luggages. I checked out and was waited at the booking counter line for 2 hours. For the entire Atlanta International airport, they had only one booking counter open and one booking agent available. After one hour of waiting, I got frustrated and called their customer service while staying on the line. I was on call-wait status for 50 minutes before getting hold of someone in their customer service. Customer service agent couldn't rebook me on next day flight unless I'm ready to do a 3 stopper instead of 1 stopper that I booked. I got the same itinerary 2 days later and asked him to book it. He couldn't book me because I was already checked-in and they needed me checked out from airport side. He said he will do all that and call + email me later with confirmation. I never received any call or email till today. I called their customer service again and was able to get hold of someone after 30 minutes wait. I got the same answer today as well. They have asked me to call them again after 4 hours. Not sure how long I should be on hold to get hold of them. And their website still shows the flight status as delayed and not as cancelled. I still didn't receive any delay/cancel notification from them. This is one of the worst experience I had. They are completely understaffed and don't infrastructure in place to handle delays/cancellations. "

And they recommend that you listen to the Qoran while flying. I prefer to travel religion free. On the minus part. WiFi was expensive."

Check-in operated by SAS staff at Stockholm opens 3hrs before, a little slow as they validate visas and pass people along to pay extra baggage where applicable, but nothing worryingly so - all outsourced check-in is the same in my experience. Boarding Boeing 787 was efficient. Aircraft hot until about 15 minutes after departure. Legroom and space felt very limited, especially with the IFE box under the non-middle seats, but it wasn't the nightmare I had geared myself up to expect. It took a while for water to be distributed, a small bottle of water on each seat would go far to passive passenger until the first service. Water only available in tiny glasses, no larger containers or bottles available. Transfer at Doha efficient, the benefits of bus service is they open both front and rear doors, so the five minutes you spend on the airport tour is mitigated by the ten minutes saved by non-bridge disembarking. Flight to Bangkok on Boeing 777 full, gate security slow, seats a little better than 787 due to no IFE box. Plane hot, several minute pushback delay and no water again for the first hour. Meals were good, staff were great - very friendly, toilets were always clean. However I've cancelled my return flights in April 2018 taking the $200 on tax refund and putting it towards another airline. Qatar need to address the seating on the 787 or at least remove the under seat IFE boxes. "

The seats were really comfortable, and provided nice privacy and comfortable sleep experience compared to others flown recently. Onboard meals were nice, beautifully presented and very good quality, with again some really nice wines. Inflight entertainment had a very wide choice of movies and tv programmes, and it was just the repetitive adverts that annoyed. Cabin crew were efficient and nice on both flights, probably better on the A350 where they didn't seem so rushed. In my opinion this was more comfortable and enjoyable than our usual trip we make with Singapore Airlines, and looking forward to our return flights next month."

On the first flight, it was the previous month's selection - latest movies were not yet uploaded. On the last big sector the handset was broken and the touch screen had an intermittent fault and USB port was no-go so I could not charge my phone. Cabin crew dismissed the issue with the AV system.

Qatar Airways is in a class of its own! Everything is superb, from check in to the flights themselves. Oryx One is one of the top IFE systems I've experience, with nice movie and tv program selections. Manila to Doha flight, the plane used was Boeing 777-300ER. The flight was full and a red eye flight. Cabin Crew were very accommodating and friendly. The cabin crew won't disturb passengers who are sleeping. Food was served twice in the flight, one around 30 mins after take off and one 2 hours before landing. Food taste is ok, not that great but ok for airline food. For the Doha to Paris flight, the plane used was the A380 which is my favorite plane due to the comfort it gives to the passenger aside from being very quiet. This is where one flight attendant was a bit of a let down because she wasn't that accommodating and she speaks like she is a bit grumpy. Also, the food that I want (chicken) was short on stock so I chose fish which turned out ok. Overall, I still recommend Qatar Airways if you're coming from Southeast Asia or even East Asia going to Europe. It really deserves its 2017 Airline of the Year award!"

On the first flight the A332 (A7-ACF/12 years old) was refurbished and it seemed quite new, Ife (Oryx ONE) on this flight was displayed on large HD touch screens. On the other flights the aircraft wasn't refurbished so the IFE was old and controllable only with the remote control (there was also a big ife box under windows seats obstructing more than a quarter of foot room) - the seats weren't as comfortable as the ones on the first aircraft. Aircraft age was the main negative aspect of this trip, but on all four aircraft there was a wide selection of music, tv, film, games.

Kuwait to Doha was in economy class. I am a Platinum Privilege Club member with well over 2000 Points - which means I fly on Qatar a lot, usually at least 20-30 sectors a year, sometimes more. I had only flown on Economy once before as the other time I had an economy seat they upgraded me. All in all, not bad for a short hop. I was, however, irked just after take off when I asked for a beer and was refused, on the apparent basis that they did not serve alcohol on local Middle East flights. I know that upfront I would have been sipping Champagne by then. Being Ramadan (although a night flight and we were traveling when Ramadan restrictions are lifted), that may have been a problem too, but a colleague at work had the same problem a month or two before when flying to Australia and it was not Ramadan, and refused to fly himself or his family on Qatar again because of that. However, one of the hostesses was extremely good and saved the day by going up front and bringing me back a large paper coffee cup with a decent quantity of beer in it - which I appreciated because I did not want to be insensitive to those around me since in economy anyway and it was Ramadan so fine to have it in a paper cup for all involved - including me, as Qatar ought to be sensitive to my wants too as I am also a paying customer. Although the cabin was modern and clean and the staff brilliant I felt sorry for anyone who would have to fly in such cramped seats internationally. Qatar now have  10 across on the 777, instead of 9. Things improved dramatically when I got to Doha and travelled onto New York. The new A350 is an absolutely beautiful plane to fly on. For business class, much better than the A380, despite no bar. It is more intimate, service is much better (the hosts on the A380 being overstretched with so many to serve) and the plane is so silent and smooth with good air quality you really notice. Brilliant hard product on this plane, brilliant service, quite good food (although Qatar has gone a little down-hill the last 2/3 years on that front - I remember the Beluga Caviar starters I used to get back then), great in flight entertainment, and a good nights sleep after my bed was made up. Their business product puts most others to shame, although I hope they aim back at trying to make it a business class product as good as first again. Flight home from New York was pretty much a mirror image, although the food was really not up to par with what I am used to on Qatar."

The bar in A380 helps to relax and and socialize with fellow passengers. Cons: only a few business lounges so outside of Qatar it's difficult to have true Qatar Airways experience before taking off.

This is the first time my husband and I fly with Qatar Airways and we love it - and won't be the last time. My husband is from England and I'm from Thailand. We fly very often out of the country. It was our honeymoon and the flight attendants starting with the ground lady in LA at the counter when we checked in and the crew members treated us so special. They have done a wonderful job. A big thank to all the crew members for making us feel so special with the cake & heart decoration before we landed and during the flight we got pampered. We would fly with Qatar again. Business class is surely such a treat! Keep up the excellent work! We will post the pictures on our social media. Thanks for the memorable experience Qatar Airways.

This is the best airline I have flown, and I have travelled the world on many occasions. I was a bit sceptical on the Auckland to Doha journey (this being the longest flight in the world) but I need not have worried, as the time passed quickly thanks to the excellent cabin crew, regularity of good quality meals and beverages and the generous amount of leg room. I was lucky enough to be seated upstairs in Economy on the A380 to Heathrow. My return journey was just as good and I was again lucky enough to have 3 seats to myself on both the Heathrow to Doha flight and Doha to Auckland. Overall Qatar would be the top my list of airlines to fly again with and is definitely value for money."

The bar at the back of the plane is great and service again exemplary. The seat was really comfortable - no complaints. On the second leg to DPS on the A330 I was expecting to be disappointed having just been on the A380. I was wrong, the service was even better. Massive smiles, nothing too much trouble, even profuse apologies for the selected red wine being too cold - now that's service. The whole outbound service blew me away. The one niggle is that the Oryx entertainment system lacks in the latest releases - now I feel I am being picky."

The cabin crew created a restful and friendly atmosphere. A number of children who were restless and tired while boarding quickly settled down when they received their activity packs. I found that the time of the first long leg passed quickly thanks to ambient lighting, attentive service and an entertainment system which worked without any problems. From Doha to Athens the flight attendant allocated to our seat was particularly helpful, responding courteously to special requests about meals and drinks. On both legs the plane was full but remained clean and orderly throughout. Passengers seemed aware of the need to make some variations to the flight path. As I had a window seat I got to see a most impressive snow capped mountain peak below. The minimal amount of time added was amply compensated for by the efficient way the flight crew managed boarding, disembarkation, take off and landing."

Bangkok ground staff are polite, but during boarding, it was the most chaotic scene. The Boeing 777-300 uses the 3-4-3 configuration. On this flight, the flight attendant serving my section was sub par of what I'm used to at Qatar airways. The food was fantastic. The flight to Frankfurt was on a brand new A350, with wide seats a the tail camera. I really like the exterior cameras! The flight attendant who was friends with another flight attendant I met before, and was polite and very friendly.  On the return leg from Vienna, 4 counters open with few passengers. This time, the cabin was only 40% full, so I moved rows and had a whole row to myself. The catering from European airports is always good, so my braised beef with potato au gratin was excellent. The flight attendant I met remembered what I wanted and made the service so personalised it was like a first class flight in economy! She is the best flight attendant I've ever met! In the rear galley, I also met a Bhutanese and Moroccan flight attendant who were equally as nice. But the nicest of them all has to be the Cabin Services Director who came to my seat just before landing to say hello, and we exchanged pleasantries. During disembarkation, I asked if I was able to get a photo with the captain. While waiting for the captain to come out of the cockpit, I was able to try out the business class seat and found it superior to Cathay Pacific's product. On the return leg, wifi wasn't working for much of the flight. Overall, it was totally a 10/10 flight, with the minor complaints about the experience at Bangkok airport. "

I had an amazing 4 course meal on the first leg, soup, fish, cheese cake and cheese board with 30 year tawny port. I watched 3 new movies on the 7 hour flight before arrival in Doha. I slept the entire second leg on the A380 as it was an overnight flight. The seats are the same but this aircraft has the inflight bar.

I flew Phuket to Birmingham via Doha on Boeing 777 first leg then Boeing 787 second leg. The first leg had an aircraft change from Boeing 787 to Boeing 777 which was good as the Boeing 777 business cabin in so spacious. You get a metre of leg room, enough room to stand up.

The service was excellent as usual, I had a lovely 4 course meal, soup, sea bass, chocolate cake & cheese board with 30 year tawny port. The movie choice is not so good, I couldn't find anything new to watch as I'd watched the 3 best movies on the outbound flight from BHX. We had 3 hours between flights in Doha, the lounge was virtually empty and they're weren't serving alcohol due to Ramadan to the dismay of several western travelers.

Flights were on time and service was good. Doha airport deserted due to the ongoing blockage and due to Ramadan. QR tackles the crises well by preponing some of the connecting flights from Doha to avoid delays due to excessive lengths of routings avoiding unfriendly airspace. Check-in and crew onboard are diligent and almost faultless. Food, despite 3 choices offered, was not so good and continues to be of poorer and poorer quality and amounts. Completely inedible plastic sandwiches provided ""in lieu"" of proper meal to escape a second hot meal service. Poor wines. Alcoholic drinks were available but not disclosed due to Ramadan. We travelled two persons and were given 3-4 adjacent seats on both flights thus amble space. Elite fliers well respected and cared for. Lounge access working but the denial of access to Al Mourjan lounge in Doha hits hard: their elite flier lounges are not up to the game. Onboard, lengthy safety video shown with Barcelona FC become boring after being unchanged for several years. I am puzzled by the intrusive charity propaganda and money collection attempt by introducing ""Educate a Child"" propaganda without providing any facts and prove of efficiency.

Qatar has never been anything but amazing and this trip was the best so far. Check-in agents were really fun and nice and checked the bag to Delhi. The only let-down of the entire trip was the lounge Qatar uses at O'Hare. The Air France/KLM lounge is shared by about 13 airlines so it is packed! This lounge should not allow more than a couple airlines to use it - nice food spread but too crowded and bad wifi. Wish Qatar shared the BA lounge here. Anyways we boarded on-time and the service started immediately. The friendly attendant came and introduced herself to my friend and me, handed out pyjamas and talked about the amenity kit that was already at our seats along with slippers and the blanket/duvet for sleeping. The purser then came to introduce herself and drinks were delivered after with a smile. Menus handed out and as Qatar does dine-on-demand you can eat anytime. It's much easier for the attendants as they don't have to serve everyone at once, but I can see how it can be arduous at times. Pushed back a bit late and a greeting from the flight deck for the 13.30 hour flight to Doha. Chose to eat dinner and watch movies - their AVOD is very good but not as good as Emirates. But their service kicks Emirates a million times over. So after dinner made up my bed and slept 6 hours but the flight was quite turbulent. Woke and washed up in the bathroom and my meal was ready for me - timed well from the excellent attendant. The only thing they could enhance is offering wifi on their 777-300 planes. That is where they are not as competitive as Emirates or Etihad. Landed 20 min late into Doha and a smooth transfer into the Al-Mourjan Business class lounge for some food and a nice shower. 2 hour connection was timed perfect and boarded our 787 for the 3 1/2 hour flight to Delhi. The 787 is much newer but my friend and I both preferred the 777-300ER biz seats. But still a great service and watched some Breaking Bad until a 2am ontime arrive into Delhi. Immigration was busy but got the bags and out to the taxi in 45 minutes. Qatar pushes things to a new level- even when flying them in coach it's pleasant. But their Business Class is the best of any airline in my opinion."

This time we got the transit visa which was applied for on the website and was quickly processed and arrived before the 7 day published on the site. On arrival in Doha, Qatar Airways arranged for her transportation and escorted her to a nearby 4 star hotel, provided wifi, a dinner voucher, woke her up the next morning in time to get dressed, have breakfast and picked her up promptly for her onward journey. Hotel stay, food, and transportation for that night may have amounted to just about $125 which is a tiny fraction of her ticket cost but I am so impressed and grateful for the peace of mind l had that she was well taken care of. I will advocate for this airline any day. "

First leg was full on an A330 from Istanbul to Doha. First thing that was obvious was that this was an old plane. The seats looked like they had seen better days and the in flight screens were not touched and had to be controlled by hand held devices in the arm rest. On top of this, many screens were not working and people requested to have a reset.  The crew were polite and the cabin senior from Bangladesh was the most outstanding crew member I have had in a while. He was older, wiser and had a knack for making me feel at home given the old plane and a poor inflight entertainment options. The meals were ok but the plastic containers look cheap and tacky and serving tea in paper cups seems like the cheap way out. The flight was on time and we arrived at gate before scheduled arrival. The onward leg to Cape Town was in the Boeing 787. I get the impression that at Hamad all flights from Doha to the developing world have to be subjected to the c20-27 gates which means being bused to a remote standing aircraft. I have experienced this before at Hamad.  For elderly passengers this remote stand departures are a severe inconvenience. Boeing 787 seemed new, the inflight entertainment worked a charm and the cabin crew on this flight were wonderful. The meals were again just ok but I slept and thus just picked on the food.

On bord, it's not only the sophisticated seat (787), the low number of seats per toilet, the meal on demand-service or food and drinks (they serve Guinness!) that are special. My favourite part are the crews, who really hit the spot. They have an incredibly high level of anticipation of what you may want at every moment of the flight. Even when the cabin is fully booked, they maintain the level. For me, Qatar Airways is a class of its own."

Decided to see if could upgrade DOH to LHR leg from economy to business whilst in transit at Hamad Airport. Was quoted a price at the ticket counter which seemed reasonable, however was asked to call the online sales team to make the changes and advised the price had increased by over a third. There was nothing the online sales team could apparently do so I didn't upgrade. Complained to Qatar and had to chase responses from them repeatedly after lengthy delays,and a waste of my time. Qatar onboard product is fantastic, however their customer service is slow and in my case misleading."

My flight from LHR to Doha was on a A350 and its a great plane with very comfortable economy seating and leg room even though I am a large chap, the crew done their job perfectly well and no issues on this flight. I had a 2hr layover at Hamad International and it is a great airport and the transfer was smooth and efficient. The flight to Khartoum was on a A320 from a remote stand so a bus journey to the plane ensure and the seats on this was somewhat smaller and although not entirely uncomfortable was a bit squeezed in. The food served was 2 pastries, one sweet and one savoury which felt a bit weird. Landing at what is probably one of the worst airports in Africa was smooth and no issues with luggage. The return flight a week later, the plane was delayed for 2hrs with no a information from Qatar Airways or airport staff and Qatar ground staff did finally appear when boarding was announced they blamed the delay on no gates being available at the airport, no apologies or anything. I found the plane not very clean, rather old and had no IFE apart from overhead screens. No delay apology was made by the Captain and the food served was spicy lamb meatballs with dill rice which was a bit of a weird meal for what was supposed to be a 2am departure and on arrival at Doha we was once again at a remote stand and bussed to the terminal where I had a 1 1/2hr transit. The flight to London was on a A380 and the seating was very comfortable and the service from the crew was good although the food was terrible. - some sort of scrambled egg, dry frankfurter and some sauteed mushrooms and the snack served prior to landing was chicken in some sort of flat bread wrap that was bland. It seems that the service on routes like to/from Khartoum leaves a lot to be desired as does the fact that they still use remote stands and the food in general was a let down.

Flew with my daughter so had two seats at the windows. Very spacious and comfortable. Nice set-up if traveling with someone. Outstanding service by the flight crew and food as usual. Used the Le Meridien airport hotel for an overnight stay at each end and very satisfied with it. The only major issue with Cairo airport is the lack of transport between terminals - always an adventure. Went through about half a dozen security check points throughout the airport - most I've ever experienced. Everyone at the airport willing to help and friendly. Departed Cairo a bit late even though the airport was pretty ""dead"". Return trip was on an A330-300. Not a good experience compared to the other Qatar Airways aircraft I've flown on (A320, A321, A350, 787, 380). Very cramped and no storage space. Will not use their A330 service again. Once again the flight crew and meals were great but not the aircraft. Qatar continues to excel in all areas and it's always a pleasure flying with them."

Check in at CPT was quick but not much other interaction from the agent security was fairly quick, Qatar use the Bidvest lounge which was okay with food and drink on offer enough seating too.

Flight departed around 30 minutes late I was in seat 2A which was very comfortable once airborne meal orders taken drinks offered and an apology for the late departure from the crew manager. Food was pretty good as was the service, I managed some decent sleep during the 9hrs 20min flight the entertainment system was okay but not very responsive. Arrival in Doha on time to a remote stand business class passengers bussed separately to the terminal, I used the Qatar lounge which is very good although huge it feels fine. Boarding from A3 on to the LHR flight was organised I had seat 22A on this flight which I like at the rear of business cabin. Again crew very responsive offering PJs night kits drinks etc. Departed on time although I skipped food and opted for breakfast 2 hours before arrival. I slept for 4 hours of this night flight woke by the crew to a pretty good breakfast about 2 hours out of LHR. Flight arrived almost 1 hour early which was nice bags off quickly I was home within an hour of landing. Great service I prefer the A380 to other Qatar aircraft although not used A350 yet.

It was a race against time. Upon deplaning, to the luggage belt and me up to the check in counter for our flight to Doha on Qatar Airways. When I got to the Business Class check-in counter, I was told that the check in was closed and she will have to see if her supervisor would allow us. At that point, my partner was still getting our bags out. I had to beg. It was such a low point that I had no choice but to do it. The check in staff told me to inform my partner to leave the bags behind, so i sent him a text. He arrived a few moments later. After checking in two bags and missing one, my partner gave the QR check in staff all the Iberia luggage tags for them to arrange whatever they could to send the missing bag to Manila. She asked for my email and she then promised to communicate via email. She escorted us to security clearance. Then after the checks, we ran, took the train to get to Terminal 4s. Upon reaching the terminal, we had to clear immigration, showed the staff the fast track, got cleared and we ran to Gate R-18. Gasping for air, we reached the gate. Boarding was about to finish. We made it in the nick of time. Sweltering in our sweat, the boarding staff informed us that two of our bags made it as well. When I try to look back, I gave ourselves allowance of almost three hours for our flight to Manila. Should Iberia did not bump us off, all should've gone smoothly as planned. I don't know what the purpose of OneWorld now is. It promises smooth travels with its partner Airlines. What for is the frequent flyer status when one is placed in situations such as this. I tell you, no monetary amount could compensate the distress that my partner and I had to undergo due to Iberia's shortcoming. When we got to Manila, Qatar Airways Ground Services was holding a placard with our names on it. We approached him and he told us that the QR agent in Madrid sent them an email regarding our missing luggage and that they would do their best to locate it and have it delivered to us. I hope I would get to hear from them soon and I hope OneWorld gets to do something about this. On the other hand, I would always commend Qatar Airways for their efficiency and for its impeccable service. They have always been reliable. To the QR check in staff who assisted us, I was not able to get your name at that time but I would always be thankful for making it possible for us to get on our flight.

Unfortunately, when we get to the check in counter, we were assigned different seats on our DOH-MAD leg.

Past the immigration clearance and security checks, we headed to the lounge. Lounge was pretty basic. A meagre selection of snacks and refreshments. Air-conditioning was way too cold. Whiled away the time at the waiting area. Boarding came, there was no system in place. Boarding queue was chaotic. Premium passengers were overtaken by coach passengers.

Traveling with wife and 2 young kids, very impressed with the Boeing 787 from Birmingham. Was concerned about 17.3"" seat but no need. Very comfortable flight all around and was able to use my cpap machine for sleep apnoea in flight with no issues which was why I chose the Qatar option in first place (787s all the way). Only criticism would be the IFE touch screen was very sluggish and the children's meals were drab plus no play packs for kids. On arrival at Doha had long walk carrying kids. Then found the Boeing 787 to Cape Town changed at last minute to Boeing 777-300. There was an air of frantic rush here as we were herded on plane when we should have departed. The seats were so unfortunately and no power for my medical equipment. Unlike previous flight staff did not know of my medical request and so I had a horrendous flight with no sleep. Again kids meal were drab and left though IFE worked better. Overall the Boeing 787 was brilliant and justified my route a choice but Boeing 777 cancelled this out."

Economic reality dictates these days that my QR flying has now to be in Economy, not Biz.  Both BCN sectors were in A330, which, though a little dated are a perfectly acceptable plane for a 6 hr flight. Still nice to have the 2-4-2 layout that enables a couple travelling to be able to sit by themselves. Doha to BKK was in an A380, which is a wonderful plane. The little Economy sector on the upper deck is as good as it gets in Economy, in my opinion, with great seats, and plenty of space, but from what I saw, the lower deck is almost as good. Which is why I was so disappointed when I found out that the Bangkok to Doha section was changed to a B777 300. What a come-down, QR felt fit to follow the trend of 3-4-3 in Economy, instead of the 3-3-3 . This cabin is seriously cramped. It was impossible to pass in the aisle if there was a large person or trolley in it, and no elbow room to eat etc in any seat. These people need to get the message that they cannot go squeezing yet more seats into already overcrowded jets to make a fast buck. Cannot speak for other carriers, but the difference on QR between their A380 offering and the 773 offering is embarrassing. "

Outbound on A330 and inbound on the Boeing 787. After a horrendous journey through London to get to Heathrow, I was escorted to the front of the check-in queue and allowed to use Business Class check-in to make the 1 hour cutoff for my flight. Overnight flight from London to Doha was on time and unremarkable other than for some bizarre reason the main cabin lights were not switched off during the flight. Fortunately Qatar's economy amenities kit is good and features an eyemask, which was needed on this occasion. Legroom in seat 20K was poor due to the IFE box under the seat in front. Food was good and cabin crew were very polite. Hot towels served on boarding and in the morning which is a nice touch. The really good Qatar service came on transfer in Doha. After freshening up I made my way to the boarding gate for the Doha-Bali leg, to find an incredibly long queue for what was clearly a full flight. At the boarding gate, the agent switched my boarding pass and only after passing through the gate did I realise he had upgraded me to business class! The onboard business class service was impeccable. The seats were clean, had multiple recline positions and plenty of room to store belongings you wanted access to in-flight. There was a good pre-flight drinks service (including champagne), the amenities kit was excellent (featuring Armani products) and the cabin crew were the most polite and attentive I've ever encountered. Throughout the flight there was an on-demand meal service, superb wine list (including a Sauternes dessert wine) and the bathrooms were cleaned by a member of cabin staff after every use by a passenger. Absolutely faultless service. What's more, I did not feel that the staff treated me any differently just because I had the fortune to have been upgraded for free instead of having paid full price for the experience. Return flights in economy were very good and better than the outbound LHR-DOH leg: this had a lot to do with the Boeing 787 plane, which had far better lighting and more spacious seats, which made sleeping far easier. I had a window seat and appreciate the tinted window function on the Dreamliner. Again, cabin crew were excellent and the food was very good for economy class. IFE options were very good. Ground staff and gate agents on transfer in Doha some of the politest I've ever encountered. Overall, very impressed with the service that Qatar offers, and would certainly consider using them again flying to Asian destinations if the price is competitive with (e.g.) Singapore Airlines."

The food was among the worst I've had on a major carrier. It took a long time for them to remove our trays, over 30 mins after serving. The snacks were paltry and seats were no more than average. It was about the best entertainment system I've seen on long haul flights. My pillow went below my bottom instead of my head the seat was so uncomfortable.  The flights from Doha to Bangkok had particularly bad food, no middle eastern food was offered which I found strange. My chicken and potatoes with vegetables reminded me of a discount meal. The lounge had good food and a nice shower, but had a smoking room coupled with poor ventilation. On 3 of the 4 flights you could get 15 minutes of free internet, after which it cost 20 USD for 200 mb. Quite expensive for Internet onboard these days.  Too bad, I had such high hopes."

As a solo traveller I hate their 2-2-2 configuration in the Boeing 777, which they fly from Amsterdam. To avoid this I use Belgium, Germany or even Skandinavian as starting point for my trip, since Qatar Airways uses the 787 or new A350 to Doha. I was unpleasantly surprised to find out that Qatar Airways uses a leased A350 from LATAM on their Doha-Munich route. The config in business class in this plane is 2-2-2 and more cramped than the 777. Toilets were messy, service below par and sitting near the window means climbing over your fellow passenger.

The seat is great and the 1-2-1 Business cabin is cosier than Qatar's A350 or 380. It left right on time. The Doha to London sector was a 777 with an older 2-2-2 layout and product, which my partner and I are usually quite happy with. But it does look and feel dated, compared with the latest Qatar Airways Business product. My seat seemed to dangle at the end, so didn't go completely flat. Still, this aircraft type will shortly be retrofitted with Qatar's latest Q Suite. Catering was good, in that as an alternative to the main breakfast offering, there were also several delicious alternatives. Cabin crew were excellent. The only issue was the frustrating 30 minutes holding before landing at Heathrow. But we still made it to the gate on time."

Upon boarding, a couple in Business Class insisted to have their child, booked in Economy, upgraded and made a scene when it could not be arranged. In the process, several passengers were asked to change seats, some accepting and some not. The FAs stood by. The old Business Class seats in Boeing 777s are well below those found elsewhere. The food and amenity kits have been very downgraded. The winesremain very good. If you happen to like dark chocolate, you are not in luck. The boxes of four have been replaced by single milk pieces. The robot-like unsmiling service (with the exception of the perfectly charming Flight Service Director who acknowledged the facts and wrote her own report) was performed with no grace. Call buttons had to be pressed several times to be acknowledged. My IFE handset was unreliable, touch screen on the main video is too far to be easily accessed. In Doha, I found food availability and service in the Business Class lounge badly reduced. None of this is tragic and I very much realize the ""Let them eat cake"" aspect of such criticism. "

The ticket was the return travel on an extremely cheap economy ticket purchased for less than 500 USD several months prior to travel. Despite the ticket is in O-class, and thus not upgradable, they sent me an offer 2 weeks before to pay 400 USD extra for the last sector to CPH. I could not resist as this also gave me access to Al Mourjan Lounge in Doha, where I spent 15 hours, which I don’t mind. First sector: in Kuala Lumpur I tried all 3 lounges offered (Plaza Premium, Golden Business, and First Class). All were good. As the flight was only 30-40% full and as I am elite flyer they gave me 4 seats on the A340-600 to stretch out. In economy I was pampered throughout. Special meal accommodated and other meals offered. Drink rounds very, very frequent and staff super alert. IFE fine. At arrival in Doha only bus transport available to Terminal. Second flight on a Boeing 787-8, flight on time. Contact-gate in Doha. That makes things much easier and allowed for leaving the lounge late as the walk took only 5 Minutes from lounge to aircraft. Good service onboard, despite business class was full. Good food, excellent wines, poor beers. It annoys me that they request charity support from passengers for the “Educate a Child” charity. They want people to put money in envelopes onboard! I find this extremely intrusive and disrespectful to passengers."

Although I had checked in online I had to join the queue to drop my bag off. I could not see the point of checking-in online. The check-in/bag drop girl spoke in phrases and not in sentences.

I understand since it's the big A380. The staff was nice, and answered all my questions. Apparently, the flight was overbooked. After tweeting this, Qatar airways was more than apologetic.  Boarding was orderly, and a flight attendant greeted me at the door. When I got to my row, I met a Canadian flight attendant who started conversations with everyone and did this throughout the flight if she wasn't busy.  She was very polite. Actually, all the flight attendants were polite and smiling. All of my flights left slightly late. The seat is comfortable however I had the last row so I had limited recline. Seats on the A380 and A350 are the same, and are very wide and comfortable. Legroom is sufficient for a 13 hour flight. One thing I would suggest they add would be a footrest. The TV screen is big, and touch screen responsive, rendering the remote useless. The food onboard was excellent. On the legs to and from Bangkok, The flight attendants saved a meal choice just for us. Try to choose the beef. Most of the time they have braised beef and potatoes, or spiced chicken. They are a bit sluggish, but still smile whenever they're interacting with passengers. I found the  red wine to be low quality. I didn't like all of the audio selections, but at least they had 5 Celine Dion and 4 Michael Jackson albums, which kept me entertained. Movie selection is good. During deplaning, the flight attedant gave me a tour of the upper deck including the bar, business and first class. During transit in Doha, security check is much more organised than Taipei or Narita airport, but there a rude staff member at gate check who refused to let me board with my friend who was a Gold card member. On the return flight, I met a nice lady at check in who was having conversations with me and appreciated me trying to speak French. During flight, one Romanian attendant asked me to help translate, and she was very friendly and had conversations with me. On the flight to bangkok, there was a Malaysian flight attendant who was also very nice and talkative (I'm also talkative) so we had too much conversation, she wasn't able to service other passengers. Overall, an amazing experience unlike any other airline. I look forward to flying Qatar Airways business class in the future, when I save up! "

Flights on time. Check-in a pleasure. FAs on top of things and one gets pampered with a good focus on each passengers despite business class were full on both flights. Food and drinks kept good standards though have slipped a little bit. Wines onboard are excellent, however, their beers are lousy, extremely boring, and all alike – seems to be a sad trademark of QR. Dine on demand seems to have caused smaller portions without proper stable food (other than accompanying bread). FAs on the last sector (to CPH) were much less professional and uncertain on how to please passengers as compared to FAs on the BKK-DOH sector. Al Mourjan lounge in Doha is very good. Very cheap ticket purchased during their ”global sale” in May 2016, almost a year earlier. Miles were very generous due to unexpected, additional promotions (that I randomly ran in to as they were not there when ticket was purchased) and instantly credited to my account. My Priv. Club card was instantly upgraded to Platinum even before landing in Copenhagen. This I would call for a pleasant and soft landing. IFE good, amenity kit replaced by new brand, lovely. I got pyjamas on night sectors. Bar on A380 was lively, likely due to fully loaded cabins. Headphones good. Qatar Airways delivers."

The seats on this aircraft were very comfortable and the staff were second to none. I flew on an A380 and a Boeing 777-300ER, the leg room is better than other airlines in economy. The staff could not have done enough, on my flight from DOH to DPS I was sat in the middle with 4 other men, broad shoulders, so they upgraded me to business! I will be flying this airline again long haul as I think they are one of the best carriers out there in terms of leg room and routes. My only complaint would be that the meals are rather small, so you might be hungry during the flight. I only paid £350 for my flight from London to Bali return so exceptional value too."

On the DOH-SIN sector I skipped dinner to try to sleep on this 7 hour overnight flight, but I couldn't wear the far too large sleeper suit and the cabin temperature was too high, so I sweated and got dehydrated. Cabin air was as dry as older aircraft, so I left the flight feeling rough. Not like Boeing 787, and not how A350 should be. My partner got a nosebleed because of dry cabin air. I was heading for Malaysia but chose Singapore over KL purely for the A350, which proved to be a mistake. A350 is not as quiet as A380, but the seat is the same.

Sometimes they offered a menu list with options but on other long-haul flights they didn’t seem to. They did not distinguish between their vegan, vegetarian, low-carb, no-milk meals and have one low-calories meal for all meatless options. So while others get a cake, you get fruits, when others get a yoghurt, you get a low-fat yoghurt. There is also an inflight entertainment box under the window seats, which makes the flight uncomfortable. If you are flying the old A330, there is no USB connection and we could not charge our mobile phones. The A330 IFE did not have touchscreen control and headphones were of poor quality. "

As always, the catering out of Doha is exceptional, and the wine list leaves nothing to be desired. The crew were excellent, and I really like that you can eat when you want, and whatever you want on the menu at anytime. The pyjamas were the last touch that made this night flight great. I cannot wait to try the A350 as the guy next to me told me that they are the ultimate plane in business class on the Qatar Airways fleet.

Having flown 7hrs with Qatar from Edinburgh to Doha with a quick change to this 16hr 30 minute flight I was concerned that it would feel very uncomfortable being on such a long flight. I'm happy to say It was not. You just relax into it, especially in business class. This is a wide bodied aircraft which felt quite spacious in business having 6 seats to the row and a large personal tv screen for all the movies. The food was fantastic - having had a beef meal on the previous flight, I chose a Nobu lightly spicy broth with seafood followed by a fabulous red snapper, saffron cream and asparagus and the wines worthy of this airline which was deservedly voted having the best wine cellar in the sky. (Ch. Brane Cantanac red, fine Chablis and Babich Sauvignon from Marlborough NZ). Best of all was the flexibility about when to eat and being such a long flight, there was a constant supply of bottled water, cups of tea and snacks. The seating arrangement works well with easy access to the aisles although a little more storage space for the things we want beside us on a long haul flight would have been more helpful. The cabin crew were charming and no request was too much trouble. I would have no hesitation in flying this longest scheduled flight route in the world again. "

Business Class from Sydney to Doha was great really nice cabin and seat, well thought out with loads of storage space. The wine selection was also outstanding (I am a wine buff), food a bit more average. A really good flight and the lounge in Doha is excellent, if a little hard to find. Business felt like a real 'treat' and was a really nice way to start a holiday. Economy to and from Europe was decent enough - but especially coming back in the A380. Try and get a seat upstairs at the back of Business - small cabin with it's own toilets and only about 8-10 rows. I managed to score the front row so had heaps of leg room. From Doha back to Sydney they upgraded me to First from Business - what a treat! The Krug and caviar went down a treat and every aspect of the flight was excellent. I was really impressed by Qatar Airways and feel it is superior to both Qantas and Emirates.

We had a layover in Doha for a day so the connection time wasn't an issue. The check in staff told us that we came late to check in but then we argued that it doesn't mean that you can check in 3 passengers and can't check in the other 3 as we all came at the same time. Then they told us the truth that the flight was overbooked after 20 minutes and they said the next 3 flights are fully booked. So 3 of the passengers boarded the flight and the other 3 including me stayed at Madina airport. The Qatar airways manager was very calm and helpful. He put us on the next flight which was in 4 hours, gave us free lounge access and gave us compensation more that what we bought the ticket for. The flight from Medina to Doha was pleasant, food was nice, atmosphere was calm, and there was good in flight entertainment. The second flight to Istanbul was even better with more of a choice of food, inflight entertainment, and WiFi onboard which was working well.

But they checked me in early superb service from the check in staff. A male boarding supervisor came and destroyed 8 years of perfect customer satisfaction in a few minutes. He informed me that I was welcome to use the silver lounge pass but my 11 year old son (minor) was not. This cost was incurred by Qatar Airways and despite he being registered as a minor family member he would not be able to use the facilities in Madrid as they cost Qatar Airways too much money and they had to pay for this service. A family member and a minor. He then confidently called the previous female supervisor who Qatar Airways should be very proud to have a an employee for her courteous and professional demeanor and manner who promptly over-ruled his decision and issued my 11 year old (minor) accompanying passenger to sit with his only accompanying passenger in the Iberia VIP lounge in terminal 4s. Having flown no airline but Qatar Airways for the last 7-8 years occasionally overflying my destination and having long layovers in one of the nicest airports in the world this will no longer be the case as matter of course. There are choices. When I become a burden of inconvenience for my loyalty as a customer then something happened to the overall picture. The flight was OK. Night flight nothing special other than the fasten seat belts sign was illuminated for the duration of the meal service and collection of trays, with no Turbulence.  I look forward to returning to the best standards achievable in my next flight. The numerical assessment reflects my belief this was a one off by people / individuals having a bad day and professional people rectifying the issues after much deliberation. Hence still recommended. Doha to Taif was perfect as always. Except having bought a Qatar Airways ticket found myself on an Al Maha badged aircraft (internally) with no IFE. The staff are to be commended for this leg!"

Before choosing Qatar Airways for our flight to Bali, I studied many, many reviews of a number of different airlines which led to my choosing Qatar Airways for our flight to Bali. I booked these tickets myself online, so was a bit anxious about any hitches that might occur, since this was the first time for both a flight of this magnitude and my unfamiliarity with this airline. I am so very happy I chose them because of the many flights I have taken, both inside the US and internationally, Qatar Airways currently has my vote as the best - for service, for seating and for overall efficiency and pleasant travel. Check-in, both in the US and in Bali was exceptional: Fast, efficient and friendly. I am mobility-impaired, and need a wheelchair for distances in the airport. I cannot stress the exceptional quality of care that was given to me, from the point of entry into the Qatar area. Not only in terms of fast, friendly transport through check-in, customs, security and onto the planes, but once I was entered into their system as mobility-impaired at the first airport, we were upgraded to more comfortable seating: very helpful. Service on the planes was impeccable. Staff was friendly, attentive (note, these were almost 13 and 10 hour flights, so staff were on for long hours) to requests and periodically checked, even if no requests were made. I pre-ordered meals (not necessary, I discovered unless you really do want special meals) and was able to change the request while in-flight. Meals, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian options, were tasty (on the way out particularly, featured a lot of protein), were plentiful and beautifully served. Since when on US flights do we get served with real silverware?  Plenty of individual entertainment options; a nice seat pack that included eyeshades, ear plugs,and other goodies; good blanket; good earphones, etc. Kids get special treatment with extra goodies - and maybe as a result (or else we had exceptional parents, babies and children both ways), little crying or loud kiddie noises during these long, exhausting flights). I could go on and on, but suffice it to say, I look forward to flying Qatar Airways again, and am recommending it to people I know as an excellent option. I have no clue as to what happens in business and first class, but I would say have no qualms about booking economy seats on Qatar Airways. One additional thing: Next time, I intend to make a stopover in Doha, especially on the way back, because flying to Southeast Asia seemed easier than the return, maybe due to time differences, we had actually been awake much longer. But also because Doha looks fascinating. I will at the least plan a longer layover, because from the airport, on can actually get 3 or 5 hour city tours. There is an airport hotel, but it is also easy to arrange to stay over for a day or two. Just check it out."

Qatar Airways is such a nice airline to fly with. From the check in experience until the arrival is amazing, however it has a few flaws. From the check in, they checked me all the way to Kuala Lumpur, everything went nice and smooth. I am Indonesian living in Jakarta so ground staff asked me that if I do have the ticket to Jakarta or not and I explained I want to spend time in Kuala Lumpur and have the ticket to CGK. Here's a little tip, I recommend that you guys should check-in via web since Qatar Airways provided a faster lane for web check-in users, however they still print the boarding pass so it's no need to print on your own, you just only have to complete your personal info. Hence after check-in, I directly headed to the boarding gate, it has no problem and everything went smooth. Boarding to the aircraft, I was greeted by the warmf flight attendants. Our seat located on the front was shown by the FA. My sister wanted to take a pic with the FA and she is very nice and friendly to her. Before departure, my sister which is 10 yo was given a colorful monopoly bag with board games for entertainment. However after 10 minutes taxiing, the aircraft was going back to the gate due to some trouble (which wasn't told to the passenger) and we had a delay of an hour, so that they gave us free water or juice. After 1.5 hours taxiing, we finally leave Paris. Inside the A380, the seat is quite different with the A340s and 777s of Qatar, it has the neck rest. It is actually quite good for me, a person taller than 5'7"", however it could be a disaster for a person with lower height. The cabin crew handed out dinner.  The meal was pretty awesome and had a rich taste (keep in mind that arabian food has lots of spices in their food which is great). Another thing is that I can actually fill a water bottle to make me keep hydrated even when i remain seated so that i do not need to call the fa for some drinks. After the meal, I discover the in-flight entertainment and it was pretty cool. The screen was big and it was very responsive (in comparasion to the 777s of Qatar's). It also have the mini PDA-like remote which is very responsive. Qatar Airways offer new movies, and I watched 2 new movies during this sector. However, the A380s doesn't seem to have wider collections rather than the 777s. During the flight, free wi-fi for economy passengers is offered for a limit (15 minutes, 10MB). The internet connection was horrible however I manage to chat with a few people though. 2 hours prior to landing, served a snack and coffee. Also during the hours we suffer some turbulences but the cabin crew manage to handle professionally. What I like during the flight is that I feel the A380s are very quiet in comparason to the 777s so that we could rest. Overall, it was an awesome flight."

Gyan Fernando",A380-800 / A330,20th January 2017,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,LHR to CMB via DOH,January 2017,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,5,yes,8,  London Heathrow to Colombo via Doha. The flight from London to Doha was on an A380-800 and was flawless. In spite of freezing weather at LHR we took off only 30mins late and after de-icing. The cabin crew were great and the meals were good. The seat configuration was 3x4x3. We got to Doha on time with enough time for transit. My next flight from DOH to CMB was on a A330 with 2-4-2 seating and which felt rather claustrophobic after the A350-800. Cabin service was not as good as on the LHR-DOH sector.

The service at the Doha airport during a delay was terrible, when our flight suffered a 7 hours delay in Doha (initially a 2 hours delay) and we were given a couple of meal vouchers. To get the vouchers we had to ask several people from the Qatar staff (the staff at the lounge desk wasn't able to give any information, so we had to return the transfer desk). Phone support was unavailable : I called the hotline and remained waiting for 20 minutes before I hung up.

Flight from Doha to Singapore delayed by almost 3 hours as we arrived in Doha. I had to ask the transfer counter as my onward journey from Singapore will be affected. One agent at the transfer counter listened to me and calmly suggested another flight to my final destination. She changed my second flight and I finally got to my final destination yesterday, although 2 hours later. I would like to thank her for listening calmly and then to offer a different flight. She is a true gem indeed and this reflects well on Qatar Airways. Unlike other transfer staff who didn't listen and just gave us a meal voucher without explaining or listening to the customers. Thanks to her professionalism, this review is getting a decent rating although my second flight was delayed. If only all staff can treat customer as professional and courteous as she did, despite delays and disgruntled customers, Qatar Airways will continue to do well."

The trip from Kuala Lumpur to London via Doha was great, I received my preferred seat, which was the very rear seat. The seats are rather comfortable despite it was almost full for the first half of the journey, the foods they serve are tasty and rather fine for the economy class. Entertainment system worked fine and the programs were updated. The cabin crew responded anything I needed very quick and even though I did not sleep (I can't sleep on plane, ever) the whole journey was rather comfortable and I arrive London with a positive happy mood. I guess the only downfall is the wifi connection are not working all the journey."

Second leg (Doha - Kuala Lumpur)  I was upgraded to the business class for whatever reason it is (I am not complain). And is my second time in business class, the seat are very comfortable and with the flexibility of meals they provide all were 5 stars quality. You can adjust the seats in the position most comfortable at. I was treat well during the whole journey and leave the plane happily with just minor issues.  The place to plug in the earphone and store your belongings (phone, wallet etc) were rather awkward just below and beside the handrest, is bit difficult to plug it or store it. I try to turn the seat into bed position and it was not that comfortable as it is hard. At the end of the day I wish the plane arrive ""a lot later"" as I didn't want my experience in business class end, so I guess that summed how good is the flight."

The first segment was okay, but during Doha to Denpasar after 20 minutes of flying we found it is really cold in the cabin. We told the cabin crew about this but it wasn't ok even after two hours. We and the rest of the passengers put on all winter clothing we had and asked the cabin crew to make it warmer at least a little bit. It took five hours of asking to make it warmer in the cabin. I think the cabin crew just did not understand what we were talking about as the galley areas were warmer. They give you a brunch menu but our choice was finished by the time they get to us. I think catering professionals should know how to make all the items in the menu last for all clients. On the positive side the cabin crew were very nice and polite."

Very good business class product by Qatar Airways. Boeing 777 from Melbourne offers a very comfortable space. Slept well on both legs, as the cabin was slightly cooler making it comfortable (even through lots of turbulence DOH to MEL). Flight attendants were very attentive on all legs, although they were not quite ready to greet customers on the DOH to MEL flight, but quickly made up for it once on board and seated. Flew on the Dreamliner from Doha to Casablanca and I found it very stuffy. The seating arrangement was ok, but lacked the space of the Boeing 777. Barcelona to Doha, I sat next to a employee of Qatar (I believe a senior member) who was very well cared for by the attendants which as a paying customer was interesting to observe this attentiveness. He is very proud of Qatar Airways and their product which is good to hear the other side. I will be flying with them again in late August and look forward to the experience in the A380."

However the return trip open jaw from Barcelona after a cruise was a different matter. The onboard experience on the flight from Barcelona to Doha was good and our hostess for our section of the plane was outstanding, but ground staff at Barcelona left a lot to be desired particularly for business passengers. We arrived before the check in start time and had to wait for staff to arrive and set themselves up. After the check in staff arrived they played with their computers, talked amongst themselves and had a meeting without providing any explanation to waiting of passengers who were left waiting for 30 minutes. When we finally checked in our bags they were tagged as ""long transfer"" routing them direct to Adelaide without any explanation been given of the implications. When we arrived in the early hours of the morning in Doha were we advised by the transfer desk that we could not have access to our checked luggage. Hence we were left without spare clothing, toiletries and essential medications for our less than 24 hour stopover. It was by chance that we had some essential items in our cabin luggage. The transfer desk operative attitude to our predicament was most uncustomer friendly. We believe that Qatar should have informed us of the requirement to pack the items we required for the stopover in our cabin bags when they advised that our booked flight had been changed neccessitating the stop over. The Oryx airline hotel was good but as business passengers we felt that a private car would have been more appropropriate than waiting for a minibus to take us to the hotel. The customer service at the Doha airport for business class passengers is inconsistent with the service around the check in area verging on overkill while after passengers have been processed they are left to wander around the airport in search of the business lounge. Doha to Adelaide was mixed with some cabin staff providing excellent service while others were lazy. I was not offered a mattress or breakfast while my wife on the other aisle received excellent service. I experienced extreme difficulty in having our flights credited to our respective frequent flyer accounts, (which I believe should be automatically recorded when making the booking as the FF codes are shown on our boarding passes). I have sent two emails via the Qatar frequent flyer webpage which have been ignored. Customer service in Australia appears to be non existent! All in all, our experience with Qatar has been disappointing."

Check-in counter in CPH puzzled me as QR now start to disallow checking in luggage further than the first tickets end-destination. That is a huge downfall as in this case I will have to check in my luggage again in Bangkok – this, despite that my next carrier is their Oneworld alliance member, Malaysia Airlines. That cost me an hour and a half extra struggle in BKK due to cease of this baggage further transfer service – this is an unacceptable change and huge deterioration of service - likely inspired by BA who recently stopped offering further luggage transfers. All flights on time. Poor lounge offered in CPH, a third party lounge called Aspire – likely the most boring lounge in the world. Pre-departure drinks in CPH offered but with soft drinks only. When QR departs from any other Scandinavian Airport like OSL, HEL, or ARN they offer full drink service predeparture – why can’t they do it in CPH? Menu had no seafood, fish, or lamb. Icecream offered but they ran out of stock before they reached my seat 4A, despite having initially ordered. No smoothies. Cheeseplate available. Good wines and spirits. 3 beers offered, provide no alternative as they are almost identical and dull in taste (Corona, Heineken, and Foster). FAs did a great job. Lounge in Doha excellent. Second flight DOH-BKK with equipment change due to poor load factor to mobilise the A380 and was changed to an older B777-300ER without 1st class and bar. Pre-departure drinks included champagne. The seats could not go horizontal, only some 165 degrees angle – but were fully flat. Food and drink service excellent and pyjamas and kits were given out. Nice, light breakfast given out close to landing – here I got my beloved smoothie."

The boarding in Oslo was a bit chaotic. The crew welcomed me with a glass of champagne and warm nuts. I was impressed by the amazing cabin of the Boeing 787. After take-off the crew took my orders and service was one of the quickest, unfortunately my meal option went out. But not too bad I then went with the Arabic chicken for main which was amazing, as a starter I chose salmon along with potato salad and for dessert they offered ice cream. The crew was amazing and friendly. They often came and brought chocolate, cookies and drinks. The only thing I wish is free Wi-Fi for Business passengers and for their Elites. Because you pay a lot money and with Wi-Fi you could answer mails or just simply browse the web. The transfer at their Doha hub was quick and well organized. But the line for Business passengers was a bit too full. After that I went to their amazing lounge. The second flight was not as good as the first one. It was departing in the morning and arriving in the evening. They only had breakfast option and no lunch or dinner options. But at least the catered option tasted amazing and were top. The seats on the Boeing 777 fleet are a bit old and when compared to their Boeing 787, A380 and A350. Overall, Qatar Airways is the best airline in Business class service."

Boeing 777 on all legs apart from London to Doha which was an A380. No real complaints about the planes or cabin crew. Entertainment good, good leg room (although I'm only 1.7m). Slimline seats on Boeing 777 actually more comfortable than more traditional seats on the A380 although it seemed like a newer plane. Not too many announcements apart from at beginning and end of flight which is good compared to some carriers constantly trying to sell duty free etc. Main complaint would be the food and drink service. The food was just OK and they are very stingy with alcoholic drinks. They had the small wine bottles (187.5ml) but poured them in to a glass and saved the remaining 50mls or so for the next passenger, this seemed very like cost cutting at its most obvious. Overall, a good value pleasant experience but meal and drink service needs improvement."

I chose Qatar Airways as I was very curious about the Dreamliner that Boeing and many people were talking about. I wanted to feel for myself the spacious layout, the more natural cabin pressure closer to the ground, and the larger colour-changing windows. When I boarded the aircraft, there was a little lounge between the business and the economy classes, so it did feel very spacious. The design of the over-head luggage compartments also made it feel more spacious than other aircraft when you standing in the aisle. Were the windows larger? I was not sure - maybe, as I could see the ground from my aisle seat. There was definitely a difference in the cabin pressure - during taking-off and landing, I did not feel any pain in my ears. The leg room was not tight, but somehow I did not feel it was as comfortable as I was imagining. I just felt lack of support on my back and my feet never feel too relaxed. Also, there was a box under the front seat in all A and C seats (I guess it is the same for the other side, too), taking up quite a lot of space. In terms of the service, it was pretty good. One of my stereo earphone jacks in 19H did not work, so the flight attendants changed me to 20D. The food was OK, but far from amazing. I really enjoyed the omelette and chicken sausage on Flight 579 from Delhi to Doha - the omelette, the sausage and the mushrooms were tender, succulent and full of flavours, but the same dish on QR29 from Doha to Edinburgh was oddly very dry, tough and obviously overcooked. The in-flight entertainment was good - there were 35 new movies to choose from, on top of other older movies. They claimed to offer WiFi on board, but I could not connect to it, or even when I was connected, it was not usable (not even to browse the web). There was phone signal on the plane, though, but I did not try to send a text. Personally, I would rate this journey above average, but I did not think it reached my expectation."

Flying about 3-4 times a year with Qatar Airways (12-16 legs) and still like the airline. Very well trained and polite crew, very good cuisine on board, nice wine selection although the choices of champagnes have declined in quality. Two years ago I was able to drink Pol Roger Rosé Vintage 2006 and now it is Lanson Rosé. Same changes in the variety of food and drinks in the Biz lounge in Doha. Never been my favorite, due to its immense size, it feels more like a train station than a lounge. Another change is the frequency of time changes with Qatar now: My first leg of this trip was changed 4 times back and forward, last time about two weeks before departure date. Inconvenient, because I had a meeting before in Stockholm and had to change my agenda and that of others several times as well. This is not the way you can do business. As a summary still very nice business class product, but losing the advantage to competitors."

Flew Qatar Airways for the first time and was impressed with their product. The overall experience was low stress and helped me manage my anxiety which was incredibly important given that I have a severe fear of flying. Being able to go through the much shorter Business class TSA line, being able to decompress in the lounge prior to boarding and having priority boarding made the lead up to the actual flight a positive one. Onboard the plane, the staff were friendly and service was top notch. Seats were comfortable with plenty of room to stretch out, get up and walk around. Noise cancellation headphones helped drown out the engine and ambient noise which helped my mental state. The PJs and amenity kit were great, providing great comfort and warmth. The overall inflight cabin experience was really great, hats off to really good cabin crews Qatar Airways. Arrival and lay-over at Hamad International Airport was smooth, efficient, and comfortable. I love the Al Mourjan business lounge. Being able to take a shower and decompress from the stress of flying in such a lovely and spacious environment before continuing on my journey was a necessity I didn't realize I needed. Love the shower rooms and the food in either restaurant (there are two in the lounge) was great. Having separate areas was smart and the quiet area is fantastic for catching up on some sleep between flights. Didn't do any shopping at Hamad but they looked like they had quite a lot to offer. The second leg of my journey also went smoothly. Upon arrival being ahead of the main rush was good and my bags were off the belt within the first 10 that arrived. Business class tickets aren't cheap but for the level of service, the quality of the product and the amenities that you get with Qatar Airways, it was money well spent and an experience I will happily pay for again in the future.

Before take-off they asked me if I'd flown with Qatar Airways before which I hadn't so they then took the time to explain how the on-board service works, (you can order whatever you want from the menu to be served at any time you like). I got some sleep on the overnight sector to Doha and was impressed by the experience, I wasn't as impressed with the A330 that operates the Doha to Phuket sectors, I'm of average build but I found the seat to be very narrow when in bed mode and couldn't sleep. Food and beverage immaculately presented and of a high standard, entertainment system easy to use and good content. Final sector Doha to Heathrow upper deck on the A380, single seat, configuration 1-2-1 really comfortable seat/bed with plenty of personal storage space. I'm not sure why Qatar Airways bother with the bar at the back of the business class cabin on this aircraft as I only saw one person using it. The lounge at Doha is okay but didn't blow me away as expected from reading various reviews, it was very busy both times I was there and I found it to be quite soulless and uninteresting. Also the dining options were limited, not my favourite airline lounge. Overall though a very solid business class product, I won't hesitate to fly with Qatar Airways again."

Was very impressed and to top it, both flights were on time and parked at the gates. Highly recommended!"

A terrible experience with the A330-200, which Qatar Airways replaced recently for this route. Seat is narrow and cramped and so is the cabin with it's 2x2x2 configuration, crew had no decent space to serve customers without touching others. No storage room in or around the seat, no decent storage place for the provided bottle of water. Food poor. Crew attentive and trying to make the best of things. Real shame Qatar Airways uses this plane on long haul flights. Flight from Doha to Brussels onboard the Dreamliner was such a relief and a wonderful experience again. Seat, dining and service top notch. Truly a 5 star business class product. If they can replace all the A330's on long haul by 787, A350 or A380 then overall would be 10 points. "

I can't think of any other airlines that match the standards of Qatar Airways. Excellent check-in facilities at Manchester, Qatar don't have their own lounge here and use the Escape lounge which isn't the best as now they've merged the business class and normal lounge so it's crowded and noisy but very helpful staff. Since I originally booked, Qatar changed the transit time in Doha and the aircraft on both legs of the journey, Manchester to Doha is now a Boeing 787, an improvement on the A330, but Doha to Bangkok is now a Boeing 777 which isn't up to the standard of the A380. However once onboard it's the service that matters not the aircraft, and this is where Qatar excels. The flight attendants are helpful and attentive,  the food is probably the best you'll get on a flight, the entertainment is good with a choice of movies to suit most tastes. The 787 is a fine aircraft however I found the seats in business slightly uncomfortable probably due to being 6'5"" as the end of the seat was halfway down the back of my thighs and I needed to recline the seat. The 777 feels old now compared to the 787 and A380, the business cabin seems cramped due to the 2x2x2 layout. All flights arrived early despite one being delayed due to some passengers in economy wanting to pick were they wanted to sit rather than were they were allocated. Ground staff in Bangkok also excellent, Qatar Airways will soon have their own lounge there rather than use the Thai lounge. Any negatives only that I seem to have lost my privilege club silver status, have to check my points.

Little to be said about connecting flights to / from Abu Dhabi. The Doha to Perth leg was on a Boeing 777-300 in 3x4x3 configuration, the return an aircraft with the old 3x3x3 seating. It would be wrong to suggest the revised seating is terrible. Leg room was ample, certainly far more generous than the equivalent provided by Etihad for example, and the food and IFE were to the usual high standard. Nonetheless, yet more dumbing down of standards / cutting costs to the point where there is increasingly little to differentiate its economy service from other operators. I lost count of the number of times I was bumped by passing traffic on the flight to Perth. I appreciate why Qatar Airways is pursuing this policy but very disappointing nevertheless."

Having said that, Qatar with its brilliant reputation and reasonable fares made the obvious choice this time around. They didn't disappoint. We flew out on the 777-300ER (when we booked it was supposed to be the 787 but was later changed to this), where the seats were comfortable (reasonable leg room for Economy class), food was to a high standard and the IFE had a huge selection of movies/TV shows to select from. The staff were courteous at all times as well. From Doha to Islamabad it was the A320 which despite being a smaller aircraft had the similar feel to the 777. The IFE was of the same quality, food (although only served once) too was of the similar high standard. All in all, a fantastic experience and more than likely to fly with them again.

Great value and service. I managed to get the fare for about $3500 which was far cheaper than any of the other options I had leaving ATL and was impressed with the overall experience. There are a couple of very minor things that might have bothered me if I hadn't got such a good deal. The 2x2x2 configuration seems dated nowadays and the service although great was a little annoying as the attendant who serviced my seat kept trying to suggest things rather that waiting for me to make a decision, but really these are minor comments. Given its a 13 hour flight the I was suitably fed, watered and entertained to have keep me happy. Was there anything absolutely outstanding and noteworthy? No, but there also wasn't anything to significantly complain about. Despite my earlier comment about the configuration, the seats were way better than Delta's business one lay flat and although I gave a good review about AF's long haul BC this was better, even though I can't put my finger on why. I am however looking to my return to USA. The first class lounge at Doha is something to behold. More like a ultra discreet luxe hotel restaurant than a lounge and well worth spending a short time in. The short 45 minute flight to KWI was uneventful, but managed to get a meal in overall great service for a short flight. In summary, for the price it was exceptional."

Yet the Dreamliner to me has a nicer interior design, a more rounded aesthetic, nicer windows and a more spacious lavatory. The only thing I cannot totally get used to is the new Qatar IFE system which just feels cumbersome and to me is not intuitive."

Bojan Tercon",A350,9th November 2016,Solo Leisure,Business Class,DOH to FRA,November 2016,5.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,,5,yes,6,"  Was very excited to fly on the A350 from Doha to Frankfurt. My first time. Though when I got onboard there really wasn't much of a noticeable difference. I think the Dreamliner already took all the excitement out of this new jet! Spacious cabin. Quiet engines. Impressive entrance. The Dreamliner had first mover advantage. Granted, the engines were very quiet, even at takeoff. Although interior design wise, I found the overhead bins to be very low when open. I whacked my head a few times when getting stuff out. I love the seat on this plane. Very comfortable and private, since you face into the window. One of the best. I have high expectations when flying Qatar for I have had many amazing flights with them. This, unfortunately, was not one of them. The food was so-so (steak was very tough) and I found the IFE on this new A350 very cumbersome to use. I couldn't for the longest time get the touch screen to work. Perhaps it was a single incident. I hope so. I did like the gimmicky 3D map feature on the IFE. It worked similarly to Google maps. You could zoom in/out with your fingers, move the map around thus felt somewhat interactive. The front camera view captivated me for you could actually see the front landing gear during takeoff and landing, which is good at the actual moment of touchdown. I love big windows, however, the windows on this A350 annoyed me. In order to close the shades with the electronic button you had to reach way down between the wall and the panel of your seat. Was very difficult to reach. I was expecting a button on the control panel to close the windows, but alas none. Very badly designed seat/window for the wall paneling of the seat by your head is too high and covers the window buttons. Looking forward to my return flight on the Boeing 787 to see  how the two compare."

The plane is quite new, and the business cabin is spacious and airy. There are no overhead bins over center seats, giving the 1-2-1 configured cabin a sense of spaciousness. The seats were truly excellent - spacious, with plenty of nooks and crannies to store things, and with an excellent entertainment system. All of the hardware was truly first rate, which made the less-than-stellar soft-product all the more disappointing. The drawback to the seat configuration is that people travelling together in the center are so far apart that it's hard to converse in a low tone of voice. The food was quite tasty and nicely presented. The cabin attendants did their jobs, and nothing more. The service was polite, perfunctory, and when they finished, they disappeared behind the galley curtains. So much so that some children who got bored started racing around the cabin bumping into seats, waking up their occupants, and then, when they tired of that, they started taking out the life vests and playing with them. It was literally hours before one of the cabin attendants stumbled upon half a dozen life vests strewn on the floor. If there had been an emergency, those vests would have been needed. The cabin attendant merely picked them up and took them with him behind the curtain. The wifi was terrible on both flights. Frequently out of signal, and when there was signal, the speed was atrocious. Barely enough to send and receive emails without attachments. The lavatories were not always maintained to good standard. Overall the experience was not bad, but t was just not particularly great."

Three of my flights were on the A350 which is the best of the new aircraft, quite spacious in economy - lots of legroom but the width was a bit cramped, despite being wider than the 787. The Boeing 777 was 10-across and horrible, especially in the middle two seats. At least it was only two hours, but it shows that aircraft selection has a big impact on economy comfort. Apart from the 777, which was unfortunately packed, the other flights were quite empty, increasing the comfort levels and meaning that they offered quite reasonable upgrades on every one of my legs. I got it for the last flight and it was what you'd expect from business class. I also couldn't get the wifi to work on any flight. I think they should just give up on that."

The only negative that I can think of for this flight is that it was much too short. Check-in service at the business class counter was immediate, efficient, and friendly. Qatar uses a multi-airline lounge at HAN which offers mediocre food and spirits but spectacular views of the runway and tarmac. There were very few passengers on the HAN-BKK segment, so boarding did not have to be ""organized"" in any fashion. Despite a very quick turnaround, the plane was clean, neat, and well-prepared. The welcome drink included a choice of two different champagnes. I chose the Billecart-Salon, which was excellent. The snack service was quick and tasty, accompanied by another glass of champagne. The seat back TV screens are huge, with a clear and sharp picture. I entertained myself with the sky-map, but if the flight had been longer, there was a huge selection of movies, TV shows, and music. Departure and arrival were punctual, and Qatar provides a pass to allow J class passengers to use an expedited immigration line at BKK.

All widebody, newer A330-200 aircrafts. All flights full and on time (one had an ignorable delay), service on ground and on plane top notch. Long stay-overs, long time lounge access, and potential immigration issues were sorted out smoothly by Qatar Airways ground staff. First Class DOH-CAI-DOH is de facto just only business class but in widebody. On the outbound they served only breakfast and no meat-dishes were offered. Likewise no fresh garlic, ginger, chilli nor fish-sauce is available. No ice-cream, mango smoothies (only strawberry). But the extensive drink list and the cabin staff service made it somehow up. On Cairo to Doha it was a more fully fledged menu with excellent options. From Cairo pre-departure champagne was not offered due to local laws. Cost cutting edges has also begun to show in Doha, where they stopped a la carte servings in Al Mourjan lounge. However, in the alternative Al Safwa first class lounge they provide even fully fledged free “hotel rooms” inside the lounge. Last leg DOH-CMB was operated by Sri Lankan who also did well (see my other review for the Sri Lankan leg). Qatar Airways takes particularly good care of their elite frequent flyers. They facilitated check in at airside, avoidance of immigration problem, and provided extended time lounge visits. First time I avoided bus drives in Doha airport that gives a much better overall impression."

Terrible if anything goes wrong. Excellent food, comfortable seats and vaguely attentive staff. The check-in at Manila airport took 90 mins. I flew from Manila to London to visit my Mum, who was in hospital with cancer. My wife and I did not realise that the 00:40 am departure required boarding the previous day. We phoned the airline in panic and they decided to waive their 'no show' policy on compassionate grounds. They quoted me a fee of about $130 to change my departure date and said we did ""not have to pay for a second ticket"". The lady on the phone confirmed that my return flight did not need changing. I agreed to the payment. A few days later our credit card bill showed a huge deduction. It has taken me 2 months of emails to get 2 replies from Qatar Airways. The replies make little sense. It's now apparent that Qatar Airways changed all my flights after I spoke to them on the phone. They moved me to the most expensive Economy fare, changed my seating and charged me a so-called 'price difference'. This was done without my knowledge or permission. So much for their compassion. "

The daily Boeing 777 service from Perth to Doha is excellent and we prefer to fly the Boeing 777 when we can. We enjoyed the A330-200 service from Doha to Barcelona and return, then had our first crack at the A350 from Doha to Singapore. First thing to say is the service is consistently excellent in Business Class with Qatar, and we would love it if Qantas was aligned with Qatar, which is our airline of choice over Emirates, even though this costs us in terms of status credits and frequent flier points. Qatar is a step ahead of Emirates, but QF frequent fliers are penalised if they choose QR. We were not overly impressed with the A350, especially with no independent air vent (something shared with their 787) and we find it a little warm on our flight. We also had a small problem in our seats in the A350 with the divider being stuck in the up position which meant my wife and I were separated to an extent we would normally not experience. Generally, the Qatar Airways experience is outstanding, including the lounge in Doha, although the restaurant in the business lounge no longer offers an a la carte service which is a disappointment. Overall we'll continue to choose Qatar Airways above Emirates."

The flight attendants had forgotten that I had requested a vegetarian meal, (fortunately there was a vegetarian option on the regular menu) and they kept waking people up for the meal service even though our flight left Shanghai at midnight. The saving grace was the amenity bag. However, when we boarded our flight to Madrid, it was like two completely different airlines. The Boeing 787 was spacious, and the flight attendants were friendly and the vegetarian options were tasty - the other passengers even asked if they could have what I was having. Our flight back to Shanghai was a marked improvement on the first flight. Even though it was a Boeing 777 again with the 3-4-3 seating, we had a lot more leg room this time around.

Staff seemed eager to please but performance is below our expectations. Staff forgot to hand out amenity pouches or pyjamas for the 7.5 hrs Singapore to Doha and vice versa flights. Main entrée choice was limited to only 3 choices. Seat was comfy enough but on the B787 it lacked storage. From what I read, seats in the A350 seemed to have more storage. Flights from Singapore to Rome and vice versa were supposed to be the A350 but switched to B787 a few months before departure - really disappointed with this. Business lounge in Doha was great, far better than SQ lounge in Changi Airport. But they did not have the a la carte menu and Krug Champagne on the Mezzanine floor restaurant. A sign of cost cutting measure? The range of Asian movies onboard is also very limited. Worst of all, their flights seemed to depart at odd hours, for example 2.30am from Singapore to Doha and vice versa. "

Short flights, good service on ground and in the air. Everything functioned to perfection, inc. precision, luggage, lounge access for their Frequent Flyers. It’s nice to have an international route on a local stretch which sets new standards for the region. Check in took only a minute, very few passengers on this route. Onboard FA’s were polite, correct, professional, focused and caring – however, service was limited to approx. 10 minutes of effective service (flight took only 45 Minutes of time), but drinks with options were provided. Only for 5 minutes were seatbelt sign switched off. The lounges used in SGN and PNH are 3rd party lounges but both of excellent quality. Especially, the new Plaza Premium lounge used in Phnom Penh was an outstanding, positive surprise with all facilities (incl. fitness room!) and foods."

I was a little disappointed with a few aspects. The seat was very comfortable with amazing legroom and backrest / headrest. The welcome amenities were quite good and useful. However, the entertainment system technology needs a lot of thought - the right button on one of my co-passenger's screen didn't work which left her with only 4/5 movie options and was very annoying. Even though they have a great selection, the hardware needs an upgrade. The call attendant button or light button did not work on my seat remote control. Also, I had multiple issues with air hostesses both on Mumbai-Doha and Doha-Atlanta leg. Even after the call attendant button was pressed, none of the air-hostesses paid attention and I had to call them while they were passing by in the aisle. I could see 3-4 other attendant lights switched on but nobody came by for 10 minutes or so.  The meal timings were really bad. After they served us brunch at 11:30 AM Doha time, no food was served till almost 6 PM. Having reached Doha at 5 AM, just having 1 meal till evening was not what I had in mind. When asked for food, the air hostess said we will be serving sandwiches in some time. The overall experience was okay but had these issues not been there, it would have been amazing."

The seats assigned seemed to be entirely random, no effort was made to keep us together, preference for window or aisle were largely ignored. My seat gave average legroom and width. The arms of the seat on the Boeing 777LR only go up about 3/4 of the way making it extremely difficult to get out of the row, especially when the seat in front is reclined. If there are empty seats you can't lie down unless you can fit under the partially extended arms. We had a 15+ hour flight from Doha, we departed about 8am from Doha an average breakfast was served at 9am, we received a bag of chips about 5 hours later. They came around with drinks several times and our choice was a juice or water, drinks were served at room temperature no ice was provided. After 8 hours from breakfast they served us a small chicken or vegetarian pasty with a small brownie; a fuller selection of drinks was offered, no ice unless you asked.  After 6 hours with no snacks they offered a dinner. I thought the food service was meager and food quality was average, snacks were nearly non existent. Drink choices during the flight were minimal, the lack of ice was disappointing. I picked Qatar Airways because I read many glowing reviews about extra service and space, but found the flight in economy very average. The entertainment options were very good, but my remote on the trip to Johannesburg did not work properly, on the return trip the remote would not stay in place and hung down on the back of the seat. On the 8 hour flight to Johannesburg they offered after departure and a small pastry after 7 hours, no other snacks were offered. There are 4 bathrooms on the Boeing 777 in economy and nearly a constant line of people waiting to use them. We ran out of hand towels on my flight after about 5 hours. I was underwhelmed by the service, economy I would rate as average. If you are flying economy take some snacks and adjust your expectation to average service."

Excellent airline. Flights were on time. Food was great. Leg room was adequate. FA's were excellent. My only complaint was, that I had seats booked for over 10 months and then a few weeks before the flight, they changed my seats. I rang them and they said it was probably because of medical reasons, that the people sitting in my seats needed access to the toilets etc. When we got on board, the 4 seats in question were occupied by young men travelling alone? On the way back, one seat was left vacant, totally wasted. So, the moral of the story is, don't bother booking seats. They gave our away seats for some unknown reasons and wouldn't change them back. They even had my husband and I sitting in different parts of the plane when they changed them and didn't notify me. It was only that I went on line to have a look, that I noticed the changes. Luckily, there were still 2 seats together that I could change to but nowhere near where I wanted to sit. Also, the Check in at Venice Marco Polo Airport was chaotic. Slow, disorganised and the check in people were rude!"

Storage in the seat pocket was poor, I couldn't fit my water bottles. PTV remote was covered in smudges. I had ordered a special meal, low fat, which was pasta. The pasta was dry. The fruit salad showed signs of decay. The salad looked ok but the vinaigrette tasted awful. The bread was not freshly baked. In the bathroom, no amenities were offered in economy. The marking on the flushing button in the bathroom was unreadable. The cabin temperature was cold, but a good fleece blanket offered. I asked the cabin crew to raise the temperature and was answered that the captain would have to decide on that. IFE systems was loaded with advertisement.

On the Adelaide to Doha leg (A350), my seat would not go all the way into the sleep position - there was a 6 inch gap between the fixed 'foot end' and the seat, and the head end was raised somewhat. Despite this, it was still very comfortable. There was only one movie which was anything close to my taste - more choice is needed for long-haul flights, in this case 13 hours. Qatar Airport was a big let-down. Why they don't have air-bridges is a mystery, especially in such a harsh climate."

The inflight experience is what I am paying for in deciding to fly business. The initial minor problems in the Sydney to Doha leg seemed to arise from our seats being in the last row in the business class section. On boarding the flight to Doha we were asked if we would like pyjamas. On replying yes, we were told only XXL was left, which were so big we could not use them. We were then asked to choose dinner. I asked for dinner to be served as soon as the plane had reached its cruising altitude. When dinner was served, approximately 30 minutes after take off, I was told my choice of wine had run out. So, of the 3 white wines available (not a great selection in the first place) the one I had chosen had run out within 30 minutes of take off. Similarly, when dessert was served we were told the one dessert wine available which we had asked for had also run out. The crew member told us only 2 half bottles had been available for the whole of the business class cabin. We complained to the cabin supervisor who apologised and said they had in fact found some dessert wine and brought us a glass. It all just seemed a little poorly organised and executed. These are small points, but this is exactly why I am willing to pay double the cost of an economy ticket for a business class service. It is the small details that make the difference. Without them, I might as well be in economy. The main problem was my seat would not fully extend to flat. The foot rest remained vertical, so it was not possible to lie down. Staff attempted to physically fix it but were unable to do so. The seat had jammed halfway between upright and flat. 3 staff spent approximately 30 minutes under the seat trying to fix it. This was about halfway through the flight, during which time we both had to stand in the aisle while they tried to fix it. The flight was full, so there was nowhere else we could go. So neither of us were able to sleep fully during the flight. On asking how we would be able to land with the seat stuck in this position, the crew suggested I might have to sit in a crew jump seat as there were no other seats available. In the end, they physically pushed the seat back into a semi-upright position that they said was sufficient for landing purposes. But no sleep for me or my partner. The cabin supervisor suggested I write in to complain. More than 6 weeks later I'm still waiting for a response to my initial email. "

I have flown this route 3 times in the last 8 months with 3 different carriers. My favorite is Qatar Airways.  The first noticeable difference is the ease of navigating their website which is well organised and easy to get to the required services. Check-in at Singapore was quick and completed within 15 mins including the time I started queuing in line to get checked-in. The smooth check-in experience was repeated again in JFK with a knowledgeable staff who was professional, friendly and accommodating. Worth mentioning is Qatar Airway's use of Terminal 7 at JFK. It could be sheer luck but on both occasions at arrival and departure, I did not experience the massive crowds that I had experienced in other JFK terminals. The seats are organised in a 3-3-3 configuration and each seat comes with a large touch screen tv with a separate console for controls. The feel and look of the tv is much sleeker than those of the other 2 carriers I have flown and comes with more varied programming. Another well designed feature is the toilets which come with a decent sized wash basin and a wet tissue dispenser for cleaning the toilet seats. Ample food options were available even though I sat close to the back of the plane. There are no overhead cabins for the last 4 to 5 rows of seats in the middle block but there does not seem to be any problems accommodating everyone's bags. Some of the cabin crew looked rather new on the job but it was clear that they all worked hard to accommodate everyone's requests.

Andreas Bartels",,1st August 2016,Business,Economy Class,ATH to JNB via DOH,July 2016,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5,yes,8,"  I was flying the second time this year with Qatar Airways from Athens to Johannesburg via Doha. Both round trips were, considering the cabin class, very pleasant flights. Flights on time, staff friendly, service and meals onboard without any complaint. Very positive was the generous leg room and the comfortable seat on all used planes (777, 787, 330). The on board entertainment has a huge selection of movies and worked perfectly. The only thing I found annoying on my trip in June, was the very strict application of the baggage weight limits and the hefty fee that QR charged per extra kg. However, based on this and earlier experience, I would choose this airline again for my business trips. "

QR flight to KUL had arrived ahead of schedule and was looking forward to an on time departure. After sitting on the plane for over 1 hr already, were absolutely amazed by the Qatar policy to let people board the plane still 50 minutes after departure time (9.45 am and 10.35), people were simply late and kept other passengers waiting on this Sunday morning - very good weather and no traffic problems in KUL. Why on earth do they start boarding the aircraft before 9 am when they let people board until 10.35 way behind the schedule? Having known this, we would have slept 1½ hrs longer as well. Take off 11.16 am leaving many passengers worried about their onward connections. Unfortunately, this flight was worse in several areas than the usual quality experience on QR: delayed boarding that was simply unacceptable, tight seating 3-4-3 with good 33"" seat pitch though, mediocre food and small portions and the general feeling of being cramped on board. The mid-flight snacks could be healthier as well: always white bread which is far too sweet, very sweet cakes or crisps - 6/10 only. DOH - TXL on A333 the same Sunday afternoon was another story: excellent boarding with on-time departure from DOH, pleasant and highly motivated cabin crew, three options for lunch (beef-chicken-vegetarian), water and juices served three-four times during the flight and an early arrival at TXL. The meal service was exemplary with two + two carts in economy plus one hostess serving the last five-six rows from the rear galley, which seemed fast & efficient. The IFE with smaller screens on this 11-year old Airbus was not as good as on their newer planes, however, this flight was excllent compared to our first leg on QR the same morning and deserves 9/10."

Flew from Barcelona to Bangkok via Doha. Aircrafts are fairly new and well maintended, and in general, all crew members are efficient. I have to say I really like this sense of multiculturalism there is on board. I normally fly Qatar for long haul flights, and the ammenities provided are kinda nice, especially for red-eye flights (eye mask, toothpaste and toothbrush, etc). I don't really need it, as I like sleeping while flying or read my own books, but the inflight entertainment system has lots of options, too. The last two times I used Qatar I had the same thought about food, maybe it's all about my own expectations, but it could be better. It just feels average if you compare it with others. Last time snacks were not that good and not really varied (it was also because due to time difference I had breakfast x 2, snaks x2 - felt very repetitive). I was unlucky to sit in the middle of the cabin, so once the crew served us, out of the 3 options available, only 1 was left. Even if Qatar is usually not the most affordable, I wouldn't doubt to fly with them again."

They offered us $250 voucher (not cash) and get on the next plane which will arrive 8 hours later. As that means we will miss the connecting flight and they do not offer to compensate for that connecting flight, we refused the offer. Also, how come it impacted us when we checked in successfully not even 6 hours before. There were several group of passengers. Then the story change, it is not overbooked but technical difficulties. After heated arguments with the ground staff, we indeed can get into the plane, the seat next to me at the plane is empty. It is not until we arrived at KUL that I learned the previous flight for DOH-KUL was cancelled. "

There is no luggage overhead in the middle section of the cabin, so the class feels very roomy/spacious. The only complain that I have is the rather horrible Wi-Fi connection, which is very slow and capped at 15 minutes for business class passengers. Other than that, everything is quite perfect."

Qatar Airways do not dissapoint. For the price it is one of the best airlines that you can fly in Economy Class. The 777-300ER and 787 planes are modern and keep the noise levels low. Was slightly dissapointed by the fact that in 777-300ER Qatar Airways followed other airlines and switched from 3-3-3 layout to 3-4-3 layout obviously reducing the space and cutting the Economy class seat. However, it was not as bad as I thought it would be, the seats are modern with thinner padding but still comfortable. The IFE needs some improvement in the overall GUI and film choice. The food quality deteriorated over the last 3 years that I have flown with them. Portion's seem to be smaller and the food not as good as before. Overall, for the price we paid for return flights and when comparing the overall experience with European carriers I will not hesitate to choose Qatar again."

On two of these flights I had a tall person sitting behind me and therefore I could not put my seat down and I felt very squashed and unable to watch TV as it was too close to the face. I always pre-order a vegetarian meal and I was pleasantly surprised that I received a different meal on all 3 flights and all 3 were very tasty.

Whereas Emirates appear to cut corners in business class, Qatar get this all right. The business lounge at Heathrow is exceptional, great staff, facilities and a superb restaurant with waiter-served gourmet food on offer and a good wine/drinks selection. Boarding was quick and close by. The seats on Q002 to Doha and then onto Denpasar, are 2/2/2 config. If you are not a couple, choose a centre seat, or your window 'partner' will have to climb over you for a toilet visit. The centre seats both have direct aisle access. Seats are not super-wide, but are comfortable and recline fully. The one idea Qatar could take from Emirates is the extra padded seat-base provided, just to make lying down a bit softer if you want to properly sleep. TV screens are big, like Emirates, but unlike Emirates, are high quality/pixelated, so no grainy movies on a huge screen which hurt your eyes. Large choice of movies, mini-series, etc. Qatar staff are tremendous, quite the most eager to please off all airlines I've flown in a long time. Food selection is excellent and served as though in a restaurant, heated and then decanted onto china plates, arranged gourmet style with perfectly heated, fresh bread. Onboard Wifi on both airlines is quite useless but that's a developing technology. The transfer in DOH (to the DPS flight), was a very long walk (15 minutes) but no buses at least and we used the time to stretch our legs. Overall, we'd certainly choose Qatar over Emirates again, even if the fares (which vary considerably) are more expensive to fly with Qatar. We've also seen dates where Qatar is considerably cheaper than Emirates. To sum up, flying with Qatar still feels like 'real' business class. "

This was an insult to other passengers in Business Class and felt like being at a busy McDonalds for 7½ hrs. May we suggest Qatar Airways to introduce quiet zones on your aircraft for people who want to relax and enjoy a quality experience in peace and quiet? This has happened several times over the years and, unfortunately, on QR as well: some families are simply unable to make the distinction between their homes and public places nor seem to have the capacity to think about others who would like to enjoy their flights - or just take a rest. I don't fly to make friends but I always respect the privacy of my fellow travellers without putting them into such noisy, ugly nor ill-tempered torture, which was the case on QR852 from DOH to KUL this time.

Usual high quality product but far from 10/10 perfection, notably departure and arrival into Abu Dhabi. Good points: pristine aircraft and crew, inflight entertainment, excellent timekeeping. As a Silver Privilege card holder I benefit from accessing the upper-deck 'snug' on the A380 at no extra cost. This is at least equivalent to the inflated-price Premium Economy provided by European airlines - excellent. Particularly impressed with Heathrow. On arrival, immigration cleared and bags collected in less than 15 minutes even for a Chinese passport holder. On departure from T4, no queue at check-in - although other airlines appeared to have issues - with ample seating, excellent wifi and refreshment options at High Street prices in the departure lounge, £1 for a Boots' sandwich, a steal. Gripes: in common with other middle east airlines, the continued use of buses at Doha that dump connecting passengers at furthest distance from the departure terminal - minimum 20 minute walk - albeit, for both legs, without a requirement to pass through further security checks(?), continual promotion of complimentary wifi on the aircraft that seldom actually worked and, in any event, is only 'complimentary' for a maximum of 10 minutes during the flight. The inadequacies of AUH are well documented elsewhere. Suffice, with Qatar departures at 0555 and 0645 - the former a B777/A332 - check-in was chaotic with woefully inadequate provision of desks and organization of queues which, fortunately, on this occasion, did not delay departure. This is a daily event so no excuses. On return to AUH, after the interminable taxi to the far end of the airport, thereafter a 30 minute wait for ground services to provide stairs to the obligatory bus and an hour to clear immigration, Accepted airport travails are largely outside the control of the airline. Nonetheless, Qatar surely has the wasta to secure improvement, especially at Doha? AUH may be a lost cause, however. I would lose no sleep were Qatar to switch additional resources to DWC and offer an express coach from Abu Dhabi centres in lieu of serving AUH. Indeed, were the policy pursued I would likely benefit from additional sleep."

Check-in was handled kindly and smart in CPH, despite I was a bit demanding: I needed to coordinate three check-in’s as I travelled with family members in economy class. Lounge access granted perfectly, even to family. Luggage handled perfectly and arrived on time. All flights on time. This airline is a solid winner and continues to never disappoint me as the product is very predictable. All departures were on time, earlier, or slightly delayed (in two cases). FA onboard in general are among the very best, quickest, devoted, and most kind that I have experienced. For all 8 business class legs predeparture drinks (inc. champagne) was generously offered. This was for CPH, the first time I experienced that pre-departure champagne was being offered in business class.  Food and wines were good throughout but food is getting less, lesser options, smaller portions, often only one meat choice.  I was given amenity kits on all longhaul sectors and pyjamas on night-flights. The bar in A380 worked well though I’d prefer chairs to sofas – and missed some music or a bit of life. The best lounges were in Doha, but also the ones in Bangkok were good. The third party lounge used in CPH Airport, “Aspire”, disappoints in comparison with those offered in DOH, BKK, and HAN. The biggest faults are the never-ending bus-rides in Doha (at least one bus trip per stopover for me in Doha. Ramadan caused that lounges in Doha were alcohol dry. Onboard long haul flights, I am annoyed by intrusive, repetitive announcements of QR charity support encouragements."

Aircraft brand-new, seating outstanding (777 in 2-2-2 layout - only weak point is no Wifi), staff naturally friendly, meal service on demand whenever you want it and tasty food. As this might not be enough, you get, as they call the premium class between DOH and DWC ""First Class"", access to the incredible Al Safwa First Lounge in Doha, where you find absolute silence and all the rest you dream of being used to overcrowded european Business Lounges. In Frankfurt, Qatar uses the Air Canada Star Gold Lounge, which is not at all bad, but nothing compared to Doha. Flying to Dubai via DWC was a great decision. This airport is really small, so the distance to walk from the aircraft to the car-parking (free and empty) is about 200m and takes, queue-less immigration and baggage claim inclusive, some 20 minutes. The short 40 min flight DOH-DWC was operated by Al Maha Airways. You get real Business Class recliner seats, pre-departure drink, arabic coffee and a warm tasty meal. For me, Qatar Airways is the better way to fly - for not even 2100€ return. Bye, bye, european carriers."

I talked with information booth, they checked my ticket and said not eligible for airport hotel. Why not? They didn't explain. I think its more airport problem than airline. Still for long transfer passenger, airlines should arrange some accommodation or free lounge at least."

First leg with Airbus B77W was ok, seat is much more comfortable than 2nd leg A380. Our first flight was delayed an hour in LHR, we were quite concerned we would miss our connecting flight only one hour in Doha. Spoke to two cabin crews, they said there was not much they could do. After landing in Doha, there was no boarding gate so it took a while to reach the departure hall by bus, there is an information counter outside where we came in, however staff weren't being helpful apart from telling us we needed to be fast. The ground staff knew there were about 50 passengers on our flight that were late for their connecting flight, without any help on the ground, me and my husband along with 50 passengers had to run from gate D2 to B3, this was 3 kilometers in distance. The most disappointing part was the food. Pie after pie from Bangkok to London, on the way back the food was even worse. Overall, I wouldn't fly with Qatar again."

Ashley Perera",A346 / A350 / Boeing 777,22nd June 2016,Couple Leisure,Business Class,CMB to JFK via DOH,May 2016,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5,yes,10,"  Colombo to New York via Doha return with Qatar Airways. In short, this was a memorable experience and the service we received in business class was outstanding. Check in Colombo was smooth although the Araliya lounge did not do justice to Qatar Airways service. A340 between Colombo and Doha had angled, lie-flat seats in 2-2-2 configuration. Service was exceptional except the staff initially forgot to serve my wife the meal she requested. The menu offered all day dining with a good selection of food and wine. Although the transfer ticket pouch states to show this on arrival in Doha there was no ground staff to welcome transit passengers. We had to find our way to the Business Class Lounge, which was not far from the gate. The lounge is an experience in itself, like a mini hotel, with two restaurants, drink stations, two buffets, serviced bars, sleep stations with lie flat couches, toilets with attendants, showers, etc. The lounge was inviting but no announcements are made. We were the last go through security but had no issues. We were looking forward to the A350 and to experience this new aircraft. A350 business class seats are in a 1-2-1 configuration with direct aisle access. We had chosen two middle seats to be close to each other. But they were still reasonably apart to provide adequate privacy with a slide-out screen in between the seats. Cabin staff were very welcoming. The amenity kit for this flight really was exceptional with Armani products, noise cancelling headphones and pyjamas. The cabin staff on this flight was exceptional and made you feel valued. The a la carte menu had a wide range of options to choose from any time you like and was complimented by an extensive selection of wines and spirits. The senior flight attendant was helpful setting up my phone for the on-board wi-fi. Equally the flight attendant who was looking after my wife went to the extent of preparing a special vegetarian meal, when she found that what was on the menu did not suit my wife. On arrival in NY, each one came to say goodbye to the passengers which I thought was very graceful. The return flight from NY to Doha was on a B777-200LR, which had lie flat seats in a 2-2-2 configuration. The seats were not as new as the A350 but nevertheless were comfortable and managed to get good few hours of sleep ahead of the day out in Doha. There was no wi-fi on this aircraft. The service was good, but having experienced the service on A350, I felt bit disappointed. On the return we enjoyed the Qatar Airways complimentary city tour and had more time to spend in the Business Class Lounge. We had breakfast and lunch in the restaurant. The food didn’t taste as exceptional as on board. However, there was a good selection in the menu as well as in the buffet. Last leg of the journey was on another A346 and the service was not dissimilar."

From Sydney staff seemed like they were enjoying their job and had a genuinely nice attitude, which was only slighly ameliorated by tiredness of serving 14 hours fully loaded flight. Food of good quality but in minuscule amounts, limited choice of spirits. Seats were of a nice modern design, generally comfortable, however did not leave much room for shoulders so sitting next to someone of a larger build meant some bodily contact. Layout 3-4-3 did not help much. Also legroom spoke of BA standards (Which is not a compliment). Entertainment had a good amount of options to choose from, but clearly less than Emirates. Not that intutive in use. Flight to Warsaw had paradoxally more a relaxing feeling, better seats, more classic in shape, but no alcohol offered, possibly thanks to Ramadan. Entertainment less extensive, but perfectly adequate. Staff polite and helpful. Overall - Good flights? Absolutely,however for similar money I would rather opt for Emirates in future. Looking forward to flying back to Australia on their newish large airbuses."

Instead of single window seat on an A350 I got a neighbor next to me on an old B777. After take-off the massage function went on and could not be switched off. The apologetic cabin crew director tried to help, rebooted the system several times but could not fix the problem. As there was no other seat available, I had to stay in my allocated seat and I ended up sitting upright, where the impact of the massage was a bit less then in any other position. Instead off sleeping in my bed/seat I got a massage for the 6 hour flight. The experience was like a joke, although the crew was friendly and apologizing. "

A great flight, near perfect, because I like the semi-open yet private configuration on the new 777, even soft lighting is an improvement. The seat is one of the best, the flat-bed is smooth. For me the Qatar Business Class is the best. The meal service is first class like : you can choose meal time and a-la-carte. In this case, either a supper or breakfast (as flight departs 1:20am) and serving time is at your choice. You pre-order your choice. Pyjamas and Armani overnight kit are provided. The Indian dish is delicious though I shall skip the Arabian courses. A most comfortable flight."

No Business class seats so the leg was in First class. Catering excellent and service on board was second to none! The crew was extremely attentive hat off to the cabin services supervisor and her staff. The Food was superb and the in flight entertainment very good for short haul. The Qatar business lounge at Hamad airport was dry (no alcohol) because it was Ramadan. This for an international traveler transiting through an airport is a big thumbs down for me as I like a glass of wine with my meal. This in future will cause me to chose another airline during this time of year. The second leg was on a Qatar A380. Again excellent service although with 50 plus business class seats the boarding was a bit like economy with a posh seat. Takes a long time to give the personal service I like when boarding. IE welcome drink, towel, pjs and menus etc. The cabin services manager must have seen me frowning and I got everything pretty sharpish after that. The in flight entertainment on this leg kept locking and needed resetting. Also people using their own headsets had damaged the headset jack that resulted in loss of quality of sound in my seat. The food was superb again. I enjoyed being able to walk around and use the the stand up bar and lounge area at the back of the business class section. This is very nice and it stops people gathering in the galley area to get drinks and chat. Qatar always provides me with outstanding service and I love flying only with them if where I am going is one of their routes. Well done to all the staff who took care of me on this flight. Hats off to you!!"

A very pleasant flight Manchester to Doha - excellent cabin crew service. Due to light load plenty of rows were empty and pax were able to lie flat if they so wished. A7-BAX was a new aircraft and the new type of seats were found to be much more comfortable than the earlier ones. Flight departure was on schedule and arrived early which gave us a comfortable time-gap to transfer to another flight. For lunch there were 3 options and the ones we ordered were very palatable, snacks were readily available throughout the flight. The transfer service at Doha airport was exceptionally good - we had requested wheel chairs and were provided electric 'buggies' from one end of the terminal [B] to end of terminal C and so onto terminal D as well as being escorted onto the bus and up to the aircraft door - we experienced no hassle at all and  would like to thank Qatar Airways ground staff and Doha airport. The flight from Doha to Islamabad was operated by an A320 A7-ADG a mid-aged aircraft, however the cabin was well maintained and the washrooms were clean - we found this surprising as our experience on this sector has been somewhat different on other airlines. The service by the cabin crew lived upto the 5* image, however we felt a major shortfall in the dinner offered - only one option of poor quality rice and a spicy curry. The absence of a modern IFE, not even a map display was available, led to tedium. Flight crews on both sectors provided a very smooth flight."

For me it took 3 bins, with all the items sitting in the bins for all to see as they rolled along the conveyor belt and reappeared at the other end of the scanning machine while I walked through the people-scanner. When I tried to retrieve my 3 bins at the other end of the conveyor belt, they were not contiguous, and the first was widely separated from the last, with other people's bins in between (I remember seeing other people's dirty laundry, family pictures, a jewelry box, and wad of cash). It was not trivial to re-pack the 3 bin contents into the bags - at the hotel it had taken me half an hour, but I managed to do it in 10 minutes, still too long for the impatient security staff. I heard some of my companions in misfortune use words like never again and this is the last time."

Check-in at the announced check-in opening time (3 hours before schedulded departure). Lots of passengers already waiting in line. Only three check-in agents on duty. Schedulded departure time was 18.30 hours, 18.25 hours take-off. Flight was not full - I had a bulkhead seat just behind Business-Class. Friendly welcome by the mostly Thai crew onboard. Seat was comfortable, screen and earphone quality outstanding and the entertainment selection classy which means a lot of arthouse movies and first rate recordings of operas and classical music available. Toilets were clean and roomy - impressed by the mood-lighting. Instead of the usual cold white lighting: warm and red colours which even made the ""necessary"" a pleasant and entertaining experience. Only disappointment was the food: quality, presentation and quantity were nothing to write home about. I had salad and apple-pie dessert but left the main course untouched. There is room for improvement. However on the plus-side drinks-rounds were frequent. Captain announced an early landing at Doha but due to heavy traffic we just got off the plane at the scheduled arrival time. If it were not for the disappointing food and the lack of staff at check-in I would have rated this trip with 10 stars."

This was based mostly on my journey taken in 2014 from Warsaw to Hanoi via Doha. I was impressed by the quality and standards QA presented then. This is why this year (after traveling with Emirates in 2015) I decided to fly with Qatar Airways to Sri Lanka from Warsaw. Unfortunately this time I was left disappointed. 1) Changing an aircraft - choosing QA I was tempted with advertisements of a brand new Boeing 787 Dreamliner. I chose the connection offering this very plane, but a few months later it was changed for one of the oldest machines used by QA - Airbus 340. 2) On board service - in 2014 every passenger was given a travel set (earplugs, toothbrush etc), during my last flight (which was overnight) no such thing was available. 3) Meals - in 2014 there were two meals served (main dish and a snack) now it's only one. 4) No snacks were available during my QR664 flight (unlike in 2014) 5) Drinks - QR boast about being the one air company offering champagne in economy class. No such thing was available, neither on my first flight from Warsaw to Doha this year, nor during flight from Doha to Colombo. These are not very big problems, but they have left me thinking it was only two years, so many changes and all of them for the worse.

Doha to Cape Town also mixed - food, seat/beds, amenities were great, and the service was partially good, yet some didn't appear happy. Entertainment system did not work for part of the flight, and selections were limited. Doha Airport business lounge is on point; especially in the dining area - sincere and accommodating. Cape Town to Doha at the gate, was horrible - the woman who verified/scanned the boarding pass was so rude, and it unfortunately set the tone for me that day. Flight Director was a great, sincere guy, and asked all Business Class passengers how their experience was, prior to boarding. I shared, and could tell he was concerned by my feedback, and went above and beyond to make certain I had an excellent, on board experience. The 787 is a great product in Business Class, as was the food. DOH to LHR on the A380 -  from check-in at the gate, a separate level for boarding.  This was a positive journey from check-in to arrival at LHR. The attention by the crew was wonderful.

Service is top notch being professional, prompt and always accommodating. The seats are large and super comfortable, with mattress, soft pillow and blanket. Only downside was I had a window seat so I did have to jump over the legs of fellow seat mate. To me a small price to pay for such a huge bed. Arriving into Doha was seamless with separate customs and immigration that looked more like a lounge than a normal customs area. This trip was definitely 5 stars – the return flight was completely different."

Customer service at an all-time low. Airborne everything was going wonderfully well until 3 hours into the flight and the meal service had ended. The couple behind me refused to close their windows (Business has 3 per seat) the entire flight, flooding the cabin with light on this 17hr ultra-long-haul flight. After three conversations with the flight attendants they finally managed to get this couple to close their windows four hours out of LA for an hour.

L Thomson",,30th May 2016,Business,Economy Class,MAN to HAN via DOH ,May 2016,5.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,,5,yes,9,"  I was flying from Manchester to Hanoi with just a 55 minute connection in Doha so when they announced there was going to be a 2 hour delay taking off (from Manchester), I realised I would miss my onward flight. Other passengers were not happy to the point that 2 coppers arrived and led a passenger away (just a quiet word did the trick). In the end it was nearly 3 hours late taking off although at least 1 passenger decided not to fly which I think added to the delay as they had to offload her bags. Once in the air, I was pleased I had chosen Qatar Airways as without doubt their economy seat is the most comfortable I have ever travelled in. I think some airlines have the 777-EW as 3-5-3 where as Qatar have gone with 3-4-3 so are less narrow plus these seats also have good lumbar support. Less impressive were the food offerings, I had opted for a vegetarian dish which was very spicy but the FA on seeing that I had not really touched my main, was quick to offer an alternative. I hadn't actually said a word of complaint which amazed me as my usual experience with FAs when travelling economy is that they barely register you exist. On arriving in Doha at around 4am, I was pleasantly surprised how efficient Qatar's ground staff were as they had already booked me a hotel room and issued a new boarding pass. Had to go through immigration which was painless then off to Movenpick Towers and Suites with a 250 Rials credit (about £50) to be used for food. I also had my suitcase sent to the hotel which arrived within 2 hours. This was enough for 2 good meals using room service but was told I could not use the restaurant. (Qatar passengers are banned from using the restaurant on Fridays). Also slightly annoying was that the hotel gave the 250 credit in 3 vouchers (100+75+75) so if I wanted to place a food order for 110, I was told I would have to use 2x75 and not receive a voucher for unused 40 Rials. Anyhow bus picked me up at midnight, took me back to airport and checked in for my Hanoi flight. Think it was a different aircraft as economy was 3x3x3 but seats looked identical and just as comfortable. Flight seemed to go quickly including around 60 minutes stop in BKK. Food offerings were even worse than the Manchester-Doha leg but wasn't too bothered as wasn't really hungry anyhow. Hanoi arrival was very smooth into what looks like a brand new terminal. At the price I paid for my ticket, I will definitely fly with Qatar again and if flying from Manchester, eat at the pub on the perimeter road before checking in."

Boarded just after 2am for a 2:50am departure. I planned to go right to sleep and asked a FA to make up my bed just after boarding. I was informed that there are no 'mattresses' and quilts on this flight as it is under 8 hours duration. The FA told me it is a flight duration of 7h50m. The QR website and my electronic itinerary, sent to me by QR, shows the flight as 8h30m. For a flight that leaves DOH at nearly 3am, one would expect that in a business class that has lie-flat seats that QR would have proper bedding, same as on all flights to/from the US, Australia, S. Africa, etc. The FA working my side of the aircraft in the second cabin of business class was cold and generally unfriendly - unusual for QR where the FAs are usually very personable and obliging. She more or less tossed everything at me and had a hard time cracking a smile before marching back to the galley. If you fly in business class with QR to China, bring your own bedding!

Check-in at the new Doha airport in the business class area was a delight. Met by Qatar Airways staff at my taxi, and they unloaded my luggage and escorted me to a check in desk. Check in, dedicated security and passport check was very speedy. Once in the departure lounge, I did have a little trouble finding the Al Mourjan business lounge. It's up an escalator, just to the left of the big yellow teddy bear. Superb lounge. Flight departed on time from Gates D - please be aware that the D gates are a long walk from the lounge - the terminal shuttle train is not yet running. Aircraft configured 2-2-2 and we took 2 together by the window and aisle. The seats are fully lie flat, but the foot space is a little small. The seats in row one seemed to have a larger foot rest area. The inflight entertainment had a lot less choice than on the Boeing 787. No wifi on this plane. The dining experience was the same as on my previous report from Manchester to Doha but the menu was different. As the flight departed at 2.30am, we chose a light meal and then had something more substantial near the end of the flight. On demand dining allowed you to chose what you want and when you have it. Flight landed early and disembarking speedy with business class being allowed off first."

Seated in centre seats in a 1-2-1 arrangement. Cabin crew introduced themselves and brought champagne before take off. This flight has a dine on demand service. The crew took my order for lunch and drinks prior to take off. They asked when I wanted it - I said probably later as we had just had breakfast at the airport. They asked me to give them a 15 minute notice on when I wanted the food. Champagne and nuts served after take off. Lunch was soup, followed by an arabic meze. Main course was a spicy chicken dish and finally some ice cream. I declined the cheese course. Great choice of wines, Seating extremely comfortable and versatile. I managed some good quality sleep in the recline mode. The better cabin air atmosphere on the 787 was noticeable. Good selection of inflight entertainment although it took a little while to get used to the remote handset. Interactive flight display but no tail or belly cam. I used the wifi which was seemed to be free for only 15 minutes - easy to log on - and I managed to zap out a couple of emails. On time arrival. The crew allowed all the business class passengers to leave the plane first. Priority lanes at Doha directed us to an arrival lounge where we stopped for comfort break (you could also get refreshments here) then visa on arrival and immigration were at the exit from this lounge. Baggage arrived at the same time as I got to the reclaim belt. I could not fault Qatar Airways in anyway."

C Parkin",,18th May 2016,Couple Leisure,Business Class,PSA to AKL via DOH,May 2016,,,,,,,1,no,1,  We booked a business class flight from Pisa to Auckland via Doha with Qatar Airways for 1 Feb 2017. They have cancelled the flight without even informing us. I only found out when I downloaded their iphone app they have rebooked me on a Doha-Sydney flight. I rang them to ask what has happened and they say the Doha-Auckland flight has been cancelled so I will have to travel to Sydney and pay for the Sydney-Auckland flight. On online forums I can see they have offered free replacement flights to other customers but are now refusing to do this any more. This is against EU aviation law EC261 which states Qatar are liable for rerouting costs when they choose to cancel flights. It also goes against what it states in their own terms and conditions.  They are telling me I will have to pay £2000+ to book alternative flights. I have already booked non-refundable connecting flights on other airlines so this decision by Qatar Airways is going to cost me thousands of pounds unless they change their minds. They couldn't care less for their own customers.

In May 2016, we found out that the flights were canceled, allegedly because the route was cancelled due to delivery difficulties of the A350, and thus the Boeing 777-200LR is used on other routes. The German/Polish Qatar Airways Call Center offered generous manner, either to refund our ticket, or to move the trip to February, which is not possible, however, because the lodges are already booked for the tour in New Zealand, and not may be canceled. A flight to Sydney and then a connecting flight to Auckland was declined by Qatar Airways, because obviously the One World partner Qantas no longer operates since 17/05/2016 with Qatar together. Thus, Qatar Airways does not even follow its own conditions of carriage and does not substitute transportation! Such poor service I have not yet seen. "

The flight got delayed for 5 hours due to technical problem and by the time we reached Doha we had missed our connecting flight to Hyderabad. They said we will get Hotel and will be on next flight to Hyderabad. Once we reached Doha Qatar things got changed. They informed me that people who missed Hyderabad Flight will be accommodated on Emirates via Dubai and there were only 2 seats available. We are 4 in a family, luckily my wife was having visa for Qatar. I was forced to leave my wife and kids in Qatar and fly to Hyderabad. Her transfer was handled by the Qatar Airways and promised all 4 Bags will be delivered in Hyderabad. Emirates delivered 2 Bags at my residence, but told us to contact Qatar Airways about the 2 others. Now, after 12 days I am getting the run around. Every day I am following up in Hyderabad Airport."

Really good price on tickets. Flights between Melbourne and Doha were aboard a B777-300ER. A comfortable plane for long haul flights. Good leg room (and I'm a big guy). Entertainment system was good - plenty of new and old movies to choose from as well as other entertainment. As good as any I've seen (including Emirates). The food was mixed. Return flights were better than outbound and breakfast seemed to be the least favorite. But some great tasting dinners were served for economy class. Service was generally good, but better on return flights. Overall, relaxed, friendly and efficient. Doha airport was a pain due to the transit security screening (which seems pointless), but the airport itself was good. Strangely, I'd like to recommend the Burger King there. Generally found that the Boeing planes were more comfortable than Airbus. Cushioning and leg room were much better on the former. Really liked the amenities packages given on the long haul flights as well."

Check-in and boarding at PVG was quick and smooth. Aircraft was clean and spacious with 2-2-2 seat configuration in business class, but the seat was not comfy. You could lie flat but lower part of the seat dropped down and legs did not get enough support. I could not sleep well in this seat. FA staff on PVG-DOH flight professional and helpful while DOH-LHR were superb. Food on PVG-DOH looked pretty good but tasted dull. On DOH-LHR, I ordered a light salad with scallops but got octopus served. Transit security check at DOH was messy : no Fast Track at all even though Fast Track was clearly signed. In the terminal, I had to ask twice to find the lounge. Lounge staff seemed tired. In short, it was not up to my expectation of a 5-star airline."

FA staff did their level best to please me in the sky though the flights were full and the levels of food and beverage qualities continue to decline a bit. Flight entertainment was more than sufficient. Poor headphones. Amenity kit provided. The space in 787 in economy class is disastrous: the distance from nose-tip to screen of monitor is hardly 20 cm when the seat in front is declined. The bus transfers in Doha continue for many flights (e.g. DOH-CPH) and are very annoying to a 5-star airline. Ticket was not expensive as bought under world campaign 5 months earlier."

The first experience was not very promising. In Sydney the organisation was haphazard and slow, it took ages to get to a counter. The trip itself was fine - we got a two seater which gave us some more wriggle room - what was disappointing was the relative poor selection of movies available - on a 14 hour flight I found one to watch. Service was fine, I chose to forgo dinner as it was too late and breakfast (nothing appealing). Transit through Doha was relatively straightforward and the airport is well appointed. Doha to Rome was ok - no major issues although paradoxically we had a greater range of movies for the relatively shorter flight (5 hours). Later in April the flight was reversed - check in at Rome was relatively quick and certainly more efficient than Sydney - flight was fine. We had a couple of days stopover in Doha which was interesting. The flight back was good - check in was very smooth and time to check out the airport was welcomed."

CGK-DOH leg was on a Boeing 787 and my first time onboard this aircraft. Love the big windows but legroom is surprisingly tight and the configuration of 3-3-3 really makes this aircraft look quite cramped and the aisle is also narrow. Despite this, the service given by the crew is excellent, received 2 meals for this 8 hour flight, a supper and breakfast while during the course of this red eye flight, the FA's are constantly going round the cabin offering drinks. Second flight on an old Airbus 330, with much better legroom. IFE is also the older type and a bit hard to control via the seat controller as it was not a touch screen. Service is also good from friendly cabin crews and arrived in Istanbul on time. Qatar Airways offer a good price on their long haul route and will fly them again but they really have to improve on their legroom especially on the 787 and they also converting their 777 from 3-3-3 to more cramped seating of 3-4-3."

Departure/Arrival is from our local airport and food free baggage allowance. Poor service by crew on board and the meal service was below expectations, the portion size left me still hungry.  I tried to get the attention of the stewardess to ask for more bread each time she walked past, but was ignored being too far away in my window seat. This, in spite of the fact that my call light was on for well over 45 minutes. Finally managed to ask for bread when they came to collect the trays! The service takes a long time in coming and when it does, they serve the drinks and meals in a single pass and don't come back to ask if you'd like your drink refreshed. Surely they can manage to serve an aperitif first so that passengers can relax while waiting for crew to get the meals ready. For the quick snack before landing we were served a puff pastry roll with some spicy chicken filling. The filling was okay, the pastry, terrible. The standard 3x3x3 seat configuration means that window seat passengers are 2 seats away from the aisle. As a result I was forced to remain in my seat without visiting the rest room for hours as I did not wish to inconvenience the passengers seated beside me until one decided to take a walk, himself. The reason we have so far continued to fly with Qatar Airways is the convenience of flying direct to our end destination without necessitating an overnight hotel stay. "

Originated travel with American Airlines in Washington, ending in Kuwait with Qatar Airways via DOH. Bad weather in PHL led to a ground stop in DCA, delaying departure by about 45 minutes. I eventually arrived in PHL with a full hour before departure of QR728 to DOH. I was concerned about my one piece of checked luggage making the connection from AA to QR in PHL. I was assured at the gate that all luggage had been loaded. Then the gate supervisor boarded the aircraft to inform me that my luggage had not, in fact, been transferred from AA to QR. I thought of deplaning, but as assured that it would be put on another QR flight that evening from JFK, BOS, MIA, IAD or ORD. PHL is only one of two QR flights from the US that departs in the morning. QR had a good 10 hours to figure out how to get my bag to another US departure city for a QR flight to DOH that evening. On arrival in DOH, no one was there to greet me on disembarkation to provide me any information, despite being a platinum member of Privilege Club and a very frequent flyer with a lucrative corporate account. At the first class lounge in DOH prior to my onward flight to KWI, I asked about my bag. The system showed no information. The agent at the reception said she’d phone around to find out where it is. A few minutes later, she located me in the lounge to inform me that my bag was still sitting in PHL and would travel tomorrow on QR728, a full 24 hours later. QR had ample time to get my bag to another US city for a departure on a QR flight to DOH that same evening. I am annoyed and feel that Qatar Airways did not handle this properly and risks losing their high yield customers if this is how they manage things. To add insult to injury, from the first class lounge to gate D1 for the KWI flight is a long walk and one would think that there would be buggies available at the exit from the first class lounge to transport first class passengers to remote gates. Despite assurances in DOH that someone would greet me on arrival in KWI, of course, there was no one there. I waited for nearly an hour in the airport QR office for the staff to come after seeing off the flight that I came in on."

Clean comfortable passenger cabins with some of the best leg-room and seat-room I've experienced in tourist class, plus decent food and drinks, and very friendly and responsive staff who really proved their mettle on the last of the four flights I took (Doha - Washington Dulles). It was a full flight with many elderly passengers (apparently travelling as a group), some two dozen of whom required wheelchairs, and departure was delayed somewhat, but through boarding and the flight itself the cabin crew proved more than equal to the challenge, with requests handled quickly (even a couple of toilet-roll-outage situations were remedied promptly once passengers made crew members aware of them) and a friendly, congenial air retained throughout. This is an airline much honoured for the quality of its inflight service, and on the four flights I took they were definitely on 5-star form.

I heard positive reviews about this airline from friends so I thought I'd book my flight to Japan with Qatar Airways. Days before my flight I got the opportunity to upgrade, which I did as I had money to spare and for a long haul I thought this would be perfect. Dressed in a t-shirt, joggers and trainers upon entering the aircraft and presenting my ticket for business class I got a look of disgust - almost as though I didn't and should have been there. How dare someone dressed for eight months worth of travelling be seated in business class right? Offended to say the least. The seats and food was wonderful. Everything you expect from a good airline like Qatar Airways and for business class. It was my first time flying business so I was definitely enjoying it despite the look I received when I arrived onboard. I decided to ignore this although it gets worse. Everybody in the entire cabin got the best of service. Not me! It's almost like they were deliberately not willing to serve me a drink or food etc. I found this service pretty shocking. 11 hours on a plane and served two drinks? Disgusted. I hate complaining and causing drama but personally this goes to show people judge you. I had the money to spend on my flight and therefore I should have received the same service as everyone else in that cabin. I'm pretty let down as this was my first time with Qatar Airways. You should never judge someone by the clothes they're wearing or lack of make up etc. So I didn't look like a business class flyer but I'm a nice person who wanted to enjoy me flight and ended up feeling tense thanks to the staff onboard my flight. Will make me think twice about upgrading with them or even flying with them. Next time I'll stick with economy class where aparently I belong. I'll be sure to share this experience with friends and family. "

Shortly after the start, my entertainment system broke down completely out of the blue. As some rows in front of me, a passenger seemed to have a medical problem, the steward was not able to look after such a minor problem as mine. So I was not even able to enjoy all the reworked blurred-skin-sequences that made my husband laugh, as I sat on the other side of the aisle and could not watch his screen either. By chance, I had a good book, and after an hour or so, I fell asleep. As I had another problem with my entertainment computer on the outflight, too, I think Qatar should check their IFE more regularly."

We understood that Qatar could not fly us to Brussels. They forced us to choose a European airport that Qatar Airways flies to. Paris, Madrid, London or Frankfurt. If we did not choose we would not be allowed to travel to Doha, where we should have had a stopover. We chose Frankfurt as it is reasonably close to Brussels. However we were very surprised and furious when Qatar Airways ground staff told us we would be on our own in Frankfurt. You have to find the rest of the way yourself. Other airlines had ground transportation available to get the passengers to Brussels. We had to spend a lot of money to finally get to Brussels. We will not fly Qatar again."

Fly to London, Edinburgh or Birmingham (and many other places in Europe) and you get the lovely new flat beds which are considerably better. But to Manchester the now tired inclined seats and average tv monitors are used. Food still good though. Clearly there are some economies being made with cheaper champagne and they used to feed you twice, second time with a lovely afternoon tea. Now it's a main meal then ""snacks on request"". I upgraded from economy to business using QCredits that are given to frequent fliers. Not sure I'd do it again for the MAN flight. Flew back to Doha from Paris on the A380, a much better experience."

But when things go wrong they go very wrong. Recent trip DXB to SYD, we missed our connection in Doha as we were late to the gate and got lost changing gates. We were informed we would need to pay a very large sum of money to move to the next flight although we are premium and the class ticket was the exact same. It was this or cancel the holiday and pay for a flight back to Dubai until then they refused to release our bags - we paid the large amount and paid for hotels. On the return leg I requested the cabin crew to make the bed, I had my phone charging in the side panel. I slept and on awaking I went to take my phone to find it down the side of the bed. To my horror it was crushed to peices, I can only assume that when making the bed it was moved and the seat moved to create the bed so crushing it, the seat was not moved in any way before or after. CSD apologised prefusily, gave me her bosses email. Arrived in Doha, and connection missed to DWC as flight was late and parked on remote stand, told another 8 hours wait. I am told not their fault, well whose is it then? I followed up these issues with emails and received two emails from a customer care rep saying we are sorry blah blah, no offer to replace the phone at least, it is not their fault, no offer to look into fight connections issues, no reply from any of the exec team. I will never set foot on them again. The customer care is appaling and reply with copy and paste answers so do not waste your time. In the air fantastic, on the ground words escape me. "

However, never before did anything go wrong. Business class trip to Oman, and on departure from Heathrow they held the plane for an hour and a half for late arriving passengers (so announced the pilot to the passengers). Didn't make any time up in the air, and on landing at Doha it meant half the plane missed our connections, including me, which meant being stranded in Qatar for a night. Qatar Airways insisted I stay in the airline-owned hotel a shuttle bus ride away from the airport, despite my request to stay in the airport hotel. I got no sleep due to the noise and 4am wake up call, and they charged me USD$21 for an hour of Internet access. Missed my morning of meetings in Oman due to the rescheduled flight. The shocking thing is that on return no one cared an ounce about the fact their decision to hold the plane in London - not weather or mechanical. I asked for compensation for the $21 I had to spend on their hotel's Internet and was refused. True customer service shows through when things go badly and Qatar failed in this case. In short, inflight service is definitely one of the best airlines in the world. But if anything goes wrong with your trip, you do not want to be flying Qatar."

Needless to say we arrived at the airport when check-in had closed and was informed that we could not board our flight. Our travel agent was unreachable to find an alternate flight and all other airlines were closed or not going to Doha where we were to make our connecting flight. Our hearts sank, thinking that we would not get to reunite with our family for Easter. Then my husband received a call from Qatar Airways help desk where one of the staff who had heard our case somehow found a way to get us onto the flight. She went beyond her duty to help us and for that we are grateful. We will definitely fly Qatar again. The rest of the trip including the return went off hitch free."

I was told that it would be open but I asked what would happen if it was not open and I was informed that passengers would be put on flights to Amsterdam, Paris or Dusseldorf. I therefore printed off our boarding passes to Brussels two days before the flight as requested. When we arrived at Cape Town airport 3.5 hours before the flight, we were told that our flights had been cancelled and we would have to rebook. At the booking office, we were told that there were no seats available on flights to Amsterdam, Paris, Dusseldorf or London Heathrow and all they could offer us were flights to Birmingham. If Qatar had sent us an email to inform us that our flights had been cancelled, we might have been able to find much more suitable alternatives in time. We accepted very reluctantly to fly to Birmingham, as this was extremely inconvenient, only to be told that the airline would not organise or pay for onward travel from Birmingham to Brussels. We also faced a wait of 7 hours at Doha airport instead of the previously scheduled 2 hours. We asked if there was a possibility of an upgrade or a place in the Business lounge but we were told that it was not company policy. At Doha airport, we tried to book train tickets from Birmingham to London and from London to Brussels on the Eurostar but there were no printing facilities we could find. It was also cold and extremely noisy, with the children's play area right next to the quiet room .Our train tickets cost us £33 each and Eurostar tickets 382 euros, out of our own pocket. We finally arrived at Birmingham airport to discover there were no trains that day to London, due to overhead cables being down. We finally arrived in Brussels at 11.30pm, having been due to arrive originally at 7.25am. An email of complaint to Qatar Airways was met with the inflexibility we had encountered from the supervisor at Cape Town airport. This was the first time we had travelled with this airline and it will be the last."

This family also had a child, that was screaming for nine hours. The child is not to blame - the parents did not pack single toy or drawing book etc.  Original ticket had a layover in Doha of more than 8 hours that with complimentary hotel. Qatar changed the times which resulted in the cancellation of this hotel booking. I was assured by there are ample sleeping opportunities in the Business lounge in Doha but do not bet on this. Lounge was cold and too noisy for sleeping. Quiet zone was occupied  so you are waiting there for your next flight until the next morning. Next shorter flight in bad business seat in A320 and I could not sleep properly. Will not book again if they have a layover of less than 8 hours."

Amsterdam - Doha leg was the Boeing 787-800. Fortunatly the ground staff at Amsterdam Airport assigned me to an exit row seat, which gave me more legroom. This worked out well for me, since the normal seats on the B787 are too small and only have 31 inch pitch.  Avoid the Boeing 787 at all costs. On arrival in Doha we were transported by busses to the terminal and welcomed by a long queue for a security check. It took quite some time as they had only 2 or 3 stations open, with several international flights arriving at the same time. With the new departure time from Amsterdam (18.15 instead of 14.40) you may have only minutes to transfer (depending where you're flying next of course) and that might turn out to be too short. Hamad Airport wasn't quite what I had hoped for. One positive note; Doha is not as busy as Dubai. Doha to Bangkok was on the fantastic A380. This flight was very good and I was lucky again and given a seat on the upper deck economy section (seat 25b). The seat was in front of the bulkhead and offered me extra legroom ones again. Smooth flight (or rather a nice inflight sleep). The return flight from Bangkok to Doha was an A380 again and was uneventfull. At Suvarnabhumi it took the ground staff quite some time to realise that their check at boarding wasn't going to work with only 1 staff member checking passports and boarding cards. After some time another staff member came and checks went quicker and the flight could depart on time. On arrival in Doha no security check, off the airplane into the terminal. The flight from Doha to Amsterdam was now on a new Boeing 777 with 10 seat abreast. Still not bad and I was happy I didn't have to sit on that awful 787. Nice flight and another fine crew. On all flights the crew was nice, and they worked hard, always smiling, always happy to help.  Transfer time in Doha only 50 minutes, which is a recipe for disaster and that is a dealbreaker for me.

This was a fantastic business class experience and I understand now the recognition QR get for their product. From ground to air, they are streets ahead of most airlines. The 1-2-1 seating on the Boeing 787 is amazing, comfortable and provides an intimate and private space on a long flight - even the 2-2-2 seating on the Boeing 777 was a very respectable product. The catering is fantastic, on all flights the quality was high and beautifully presented. The Barramundi in Saffron sauce I was served on the way back from Melbourne, was something I would be very happy with at a high end restaurant! There biggest asset is their staff who provide consistent and warm hospitality. I was greeted by name on boarding on several flights, including with 'salaam' which was a nice touch. The lounge staff were friendly without being overbearing and the guy manning the showers outbound deserves a massive pat on the back as he went out of his way to ensure I had everything I needed to get refreshed. Outbound on my flight DOH-MEL I was unwell so unfortunately didn't get to enjoy the catering (which looked amazing from the menu) or bar but was well looked after by staff onboard the flight including the CSD who checked up on me throughout the flight. Inbound on the last leg to CPH, my seat area hadn't been cleaned properly due to late landing and turnaround of the plane. This was unacceptable but once crew was informed she was embarrassed and tried her best to rectify the problem and tried to more make up for it through the rest of the flight.

I had a Single seat at a window, very comfortable in each position. Fully flat it gets a good bed, but not the best in the industry. Storage for hand luggage is limited when you travel with carry-on only, passengers seating in the middle row put theirs in your compartment as well. The food is really excellent (some of the dishes came close to food quality on Swiss First!) The crew were young and very different from one flight to the other, but in general friendly and efficient. I reckon Qatar Airways crew is better in most ways then their competitors from the Middle East. Ii wonder what is all the fuss about air quality or bigger windows on Boeing 787 : I could not realize that the air would be better than other aircraft, I could not tell that the windows are bigger then on other planes."

Seats were comfortable and service was good. However experience at Doha Airport was not good. Connecting flight to Muscat was missed due to delay in arriving flight. At the airport the best airline staff could do was to hand over the boarding pass for the next available flight which was after 7 hours and show the way towards the terminal which was disappointing.

I found the legroom was not enough. The cabin crew don't do any kind of beverage service, you kind of have to get their attention to get a drink.  As for the in-seat entertainment although there is a good choice of stuff to watch, the screens use a touch-screen control which doesn't seem very sensitive, meaning you get people tapping the back of your seat with a great deal of force  - not great if you want to sleep. The screens are actually a bit too big, meaning if the seat in front goes back it's so much in your face it's not pleasant."

The food was served quickly when asked for as they offer serve on demand which is ideal when having two flights within a very short time, in fact the food was too plentiful on the first flight from BKK that after picking up our flight to Manchester we couldn't manage any more. Great airline, will certainly use again on my next flight."

However, the Boeing 787 between Stockholm and Doha had less leg room and width then the A380 between Doha and BKK. Other than that the overall service was better on A380.

Entertaiment system was better on A380. Qatar is a great airline. However, if the 787 is not comfortable enough for long-haul flights. "

Clean, spacious seating and friendly service of the crew, the attention to detail was stand out. I had many worried when the plane takes off since my mother was sick. My mother got sick from the claustrophobia and fear of heights for a long time flight But I told this fact to crew, she asked to the passengers the excuse and she took a step for my mother can lie down. In addition, she frequently checked my mother’s condition, and she asked if my mother needs. It might be small kindness because of her duty, but for my family, it was really impressive service. Although the many time goes by, I’d like to compliment the crew at the time. "

The crews were very helpful and friendly (in the A380 bar they really excelled), food and wine so enjoyable that seconds were offered if available! If there was any downside it was the Boeing 787 - after the space of the A380 it felt noisy, the blinds didn't keep the setting sun out, and something of a throwback to narrow bodied longhaul aircraft but without the romance - I am old enough to remember 707s and the DC8s.

I was told its because they needed to block off for another parent but there is only space for one bassinet!  The sitting arrangements were 2x4x2 and we had the 2 seats by the window.  I felt it would have been much more helpful if the airline allowed families to book seats together from the start instead of trying to sort it out onboard or at the gate. Food was nice but stewardess doesnt seem so attentive. Leg room space seem good, the 30kg luggage allowance is generous, but our baby pram seem to have got lost on our return journey - we got it back 1 day later. In flight movies seem limited and difficult to browse through, and no free complimentary wifi on board.

I could sleep very well without sliding down. Food and beverages were of excellent quality throughout, including in the new very large business lounge in DOH.

I enjoyed the meals I chose and had no problem obtaining my first choices on any of the flights, although on the second leg on both flights I only wanted breakfast. However, my husband was disappointed the vegetarian meals he had pre-ordered. Onboard the staff didn't acknowledge he had ordered a special meal, he was just handed the standard business class menu and had to point out his pre-order to the attendant. If a special meal is ordered it seems only the main course is changed. He had to have the Arabian mezze as a starter. The first vegetarian main course he was served (Madrid-Doha) was a disaster. It was described as Asian vegetarian  and was just vegetables and rice and had to be sent back for reheating. On the return journey he abandoned special meal orders and chose the vegetarian option from the main menu instead which were much better. Lounges at Madrid, Bangkok and especially Doha were good, and I was able to take a shower in the very nice private bathrooms in the Al Mourjan lounge in both directions, much appreciated to freshen up between flights."

Around 1.5 hours into your journey you get the meal service. This wasn't preceded with a drinks service, the drink was served with the meal, and service was incredibly slow. After the trays were collected, cabin lights are dimmed, and turned back on two hours before landing where you are given a snack (on the 6 hour leg from LHR to DOH this meant no more than two hours between meals). The snack is cleared but there was still 1.5 hours of the flight remaining - this second service could take place a little later into the flight. Cabin staff should bring a tray of drinks around occasionally but on my flight having a chat in the galley seemed to take priority. If laptops should be turned off during landing / take off the staff should enforce this rule, not just leave it as they do the cabin check. Blankets and headsets should be collected before landing in my opinion. I have recommended this airline but it was a border line decision (swayed by good prices and on time performance)."

They still were out of champagne on the Bangkok to Doha leg (rose only) but the food and service were great. Being my first time on an A380 with bar, after dinner we spent a short time there and the staff were absolutely delightful (and they found some white Krug champagne too). The space on both the A380 and Boeing 787 was almost identical and very comfortable. My only gripe is that on the morning flight from Doha to Edinburgh we were hungry and had breakfast shortly after take off on a 7.5 hour flight. By 5 hours into the flight all we had been offered was drinks, tea and coffee. After mentioning I was peckish, I was given a packet of chocolate cookies. About an hour out of Edinburgh, the cabin crew discreetly asked the few passengers who looked hungry if they wanted a snack and brought out some bits and pieces (I had ravioli and someone else a cheeseboard). I got the feeling this was leftovers rather than an actual snack service since they kept running out of dishes and not everyone received something. Maybe a little self-help sandwich bar would work on this flight?"

However, when things go wrong it was different. The BKK-DOH flight was ready to leave when they decided to take 2 people off (no idea why) and whilst their luggage was being removed the gurney hit the side of the plane and caused some damage. Not the fault of the airline, this stuff happens.  After 2+ hours on the plane with no information we disembarked. After getting breakfast, I noticed there was a new gate on the departures board. Arriving at the gate, there were around 300 people crowded round a desk with 2 computers and 5 staff, who were apparently trying to get people on different flights. After 3 hours without any discernable progress someone came and told us to move to a lounge. Staff disappeared for 5 hours. Eventually we were told we were moving to a hotel. Having been rushed through customs, our guide ran off leaving me to go downstairs to the Qatar office to find the bus. We were given contradictory information or none at all and the management of the problem was lamentable. Eventually got on a KLM flight 36 hours later (having been told the previous evening that they couldn't book me on another airline). A dreaful experience and I would be reluctant to fly with them again."

I understand these things can happen, but the treatment was the worst I experienced. I was sitting in the lounge and noticed a Qatar Airways staff walking around with a sign saying Singapore. He told me the flight had cancelled but I had an option to take the flight to Kuala Lumpur and then another flight to Singapore, and assured me I would be in Singapore by 11pm. He disappeared for around 45 minutes and then came back to collect me at 7.20am. But as the flight was due to depart at 7.40am we had to run to the other side of the airport.  At the gate he gave the boarding card for the connecting flight then rushed us onto the aircraft. Only when the plane was taxiing did we discover the boarding card was for a flight that didn't land until 00.15am! He hadn't the courtesy to tell us we were on a different connecting flight. We were met at KL and given paper to put our details as the luggage had not made the flight, but would be couriered to us. 24 hours after landing the luggage hadn't arrived. I contacted Changi Airport to find out Qatar Airways hadn't passed my address and contact details to them. In terms of seat comfort and service does not compare favorably to Singapore Airlines."

Check in at Shanghai was smooth and got my pre-selected seat 6K. Was spending time with my partner who sent me off so didn't go to the lounge. The first leg left Shanghai on time and reached Doha 20 mins early. Cabin crew was professional and cheery, refilled my wines and offered me to try their other wines which I thought was a nice touch. Qatar Airways offer Dine on demand for premium cabin passengers. As this was a late night flight only light meals and breakfast were served but they were reasonably nice. Transfer at Doha was seamless and the lounge was huge and airy, quite crowded but had quiet corners to rest alone. The second leg departing Doha was not as good as the first leg. Boarding chaotic, service was still fair but cabin crew seemed robotic and a little disinterested.  I ordered lamb as main and it was a little overcooked. Arrived Montreal on time. The seat was very spacious and easy to sleep in, but 2-2-2 seating meant that passengers in window seat had to cross over their neighbors to get out. So for me one of the minddle pair of seats would be your choice. IFE was limited for East Asain people but was reasonable considering their main destinations are within Western.

Leg room was very acceptable especially as my husband is over 6 feet tall. Entertainment offered was the same on all 4 flights, but was varied and there was plenty to choose from. The airport at Doha was beautiful and its' structure was much admired by my consultant structural engineer husband. On the return flight we had an 8 hour layover at Doha so decided to book the Airport Hotel for 5-8 hour slot. A little pricey but well worth having a rest and a swim for nearly an hour in a stunning pool on the 4th floor overlooking the concourse. I think the staff were somewhat surprised to find a middle aged couple so keen on a swim so early in the morning! So thank you Qatar Airways, you made a long journey more than bearable."

I thought it was going to be impossible to make it onto my connecting flight to Cleveland, but the flight attendants were amazing. They ensured I was the first to get off the plane (even before first class passengers). They had called ahead to ground staff members and there was someone waiting for me as I exited the aircraft, with a bright orange sign that allowed me to cut to the front of every line (immigration, security check, etc).

The seat is very good although the legroom in sleeping position (under the stowing room of the seat in front) could be better, especially if you turn your body when sleeping. The much advertised mattresses are no longer in use. Food is good to very good considered plane conditions. Unfortunately my order (given directly after take off) on the first leg could not be delivered exactly, as they gave away my first course and also the Gewürztraminer wine was no longer available. The IFE comes with a very nice 17"" screen (not stowable). Movie selection could be better for new releases.

This time I travelled in First Class from Doha to Bangkok and return, and it was outstanding in every way! Discreet, personal,  professional and comfortable all the way! Qatar Airways have their service up to the highest standards possible. It was lovely to see caviar in First Class and a superb selection of wines and champagnes. Entertainment, amenities, sleeper suits and slippers all of great quality and I was able to fully enjoy and fully rest both ways. Their ground service match the inflight services with superb lounges in both London and Doha.

I arrived at Tokyo Haneda 6 hours prior to departure due to a domestic flight, but I couldn't check my bags in until 2 hours prior. Japan Airlines handle Qatar Airways at HND, and their check in desks are always open, so I don't know why they can't take their partners bags early. It was also disappointing that Premium Class pax can't use the fast rack security lanes here. But you do get access to Japan Airlines First/Premium Sakura lounge, which has all the facilities you need. Boeing 787 left a few mins late, and once airborne I was asleep on the very comfortable lie flat seat. When I woke up I dined (on demand) on good quality Japanese and Western food, and then rested for the rest of this 12 hour sector. Transfer at DOH was slightly less chaotic than outbound, but it is noticeable that the volume of transfer pax has not been well planned for and security is somewhat lax to get pax through quickly. Signage in DOH is poor, and I struggled to find my way to the Business lounge. Boarding the A380 was a treat (my first time) - we were warmly welcomed by a charming FA who took our coats and offered us a drink. I cannot believe how quiet the A380 is, especially on take-off. We had a great flight, enjoying the lounge bar for a cocktail before lunch, having a nap in the great seats (same as 787) and watching the IFE, A top class journey! But I could not connect to the internet, as it was very slow. So in my free 15 mins worth I didn't download a single page."

My flight from Alexandria wasn't very enjoyable. We did not have personal IFE, but the food was excellent. The seats were average A320 seats. On arrival to Doha we were brought to the terminal with buses - if you travel in the morning and noon, the airport is really empty at these hours. We arrived in Doha around 5pm. Hamad International Airport in Doha is huge, but its extremely easy to navigate through. We had a 3 hour layover but had to time to eat and buy some souvenirs. Our flight to Kuwait was short, but the Boeing 787 seats are crammed, and I did not like the food. It was a kind of pastry with either chicken or lamb and my pastry wasn't baked properly. On flights under than 1 hour earphones won't be given out. The cabin was clean, but the 3x3x3 configuration wasn't what I was hoping for. On my flight back to Doha, the same pastry was offered and I declined. I don't like the dimmable window shade that Boeing 787 aircraft have - extremely annoying to people trying to sleep at day-time. The flight attendants were grumpy on Kuwait flights. Our layover in Doha wasn't as long as on our inbound trip, but we still had time to grab a burger before proceeding to our gate. The airport was empty (it was noon) but be aware that you have to walk a lot (our gate was C13). On the flight back to Alexandria I had lamb and maybe the chicken option would have been better. On both my flights from and to Alexandria the food included fried vegetables, chicken/lamb, a small salad, and a piece of cake. In March I'm flying with Qatar Airways from Cairo to Oman, and I'm looking forward to their 777 cabin layout. I do suggest that people fly on Qatar Airways, it is much more enjoyable than Turkish Airlines for example."

The meals were okay, some of the side dishes had tastes I was not accustomed to. On my trip home from London to Singapore via Doha, the plane from London arrived at Doha late by about half an hour. Because the transit time was only 45 minutes, we missed the connecting flight back to Singapore and the way they handled this could have been improved. Before we started running to the connecting gate, someone could have informed us that there was no point doing so and bring us to the customer service for alternative flights. When a large group of us approached the customer service, some staff seemed flustered and annoyed instead of calming down the passengers politely. When we asked for an alternative flight, they gave us one which leaves Doha 12 hours later. They should not sell connecting flights with such short times."

All flights were on time, the planes spotlessly clean, IFE was fully functioning throughout. I was personally greeted as a frequent flier on each leg, and for the vast majority who use economy, Qatar Airways Boeing 777 remains the best in class for long haul comfort. Alas, hot towels are long gone; boiled sweets prior to take off disappeared, and compared to my previous flight in July, chocolate bars are not distributed during the night, metal cutlery replaced by plastic. The flight from Doha to Abu Dhabi was covered by an A320 operated by Qatar's putative (defunct?) Saudi Arabian budget airline, Al Maha. The lack of facilities onboard was not a major issue for a 40 minute flight, though annoying if you'd paid for first class, but rather symptomatic of an airline that no longer seems to go the extra mile for quality."

L Aritonang",A350 / Boeing 787,30th December 2015,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,SIN to LHR via DOH,December 2015,3.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3,no,5,"Economy class from Singapore to London via Doha. The food was dull, and A350 from Singapore is not impressive, there was a leak from the WC in one of the toilet. The FAs were quite courteous, but were not much better than their competitors. One thing that is quite annoying is that they use a different lounge for One World premium members. They have their own lounge for business class passengers, but lounge in Doha airport that I used as BA gold member is pretty much useless. I would probably recommend Qatar Airways if you can get good price."

Richard Mortara",A330 / A350 / Boeing 787,28th December 2015,Solo Leisure,Business Class,LHR to SIN via DOH,December 2015,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4,yes,8,"London to Singapore via Doha with Qatar Airways. All flights on time except SIN-DOH which arrived 20 mins late. Seating on A330 is 2x2x2 which is a problem, but 1x2x1 seating on the other aircraft means greater privacy. Seats are fine and comfortable enough to sleep. Food was good and available on demand, but on the flight from London the English breakfast had run out by the time my order was taken (row 4). If you choose to eat later in the the flight, there may be little chance of your first or second choices being available. Not a good point for business class. My bland meals to/from Singapore were ok, but the salads were poor and one of the soups was anything but bland it seemed to me. AVOD fine with the greatest choice available on the A350, including a tail mounted camera which gives an amazing perspective of flying at high altitude. All crew good, friendly, efficient and welcoming. Certainly the service is up there with some of the best but they should look at improving quantities of certain dishes which are bound to be popular on certain sectors."

Business class does not get better than this with regard to service, food, cabin layout and ambiance. The seat was magnificent with controls that got you into the seat or lying position of your choice. I connected with Aer Lingus from Dublin bypassing the more direct option using either Etihad or Emirates. Smart move. I have used both of these airlines in business on a few occasions and although good in themselves come nowhere near the Qatar Airways product for its elegance, comfort and consistency. Being part of the one world alliance is also an added bonus. Rightly the number one airline offering a lounge in Doha that is just unbeatable. I look forward to their arrival some day into the Irish market. "

The A380 on the DOH-BKK sector, is an experience in itself. Excellent IFE, 3D touch screen TV, 15 mins free wifi and on air network service is a top quality product. QR deserves the 5 star ranking and it will be my only choise for my middle and far east flights."

Arrived punctually at Doha, where I had a 2hr 30min connection for the next flight to Singapore. Next segment was in an A350 : a very new aircraft, very nice decoration and design of the business class cabin (no first class). Service onboard also excellent, nice crew, always ready to help and to offer you what you want. No complains and deserves the 5 stars."

The flights were on time and check in staff very welcoming and efficient. The food was average, service was okay, my headset was broken on one leg and I didn't get a replacement. My main issue was even though at check in I was in an aisle seat, for the longer leg this was changed at the gate and they would not move me again - even though this had happened on my outbound as well within less than a week. I explained my circumstances but the gate person was not interested and was told it was because I was travelling alone."

I got an exit seat where two families with small kids were sitting. All night long these kids have cried. So I experienced uncomfortable flight. But nothing the airline can do. Seat pitch was good because of an emergency exit. Very attentive and friendly cabin crew. IFE contained many new movies, musics and games. My flight experience was nice. Would fly with them again."

As usual it was a pleasure to fly with Qatar Airways, but not perfect. The Business product on the 777 is not the latest, but it is very spacious and so much better than other carriers. Seat was a little hard. My first experience of the Boeing 787 product, which I thought was great, even though at first sight it appears more cramped (I did graze my shin on the TV shelf when trying to get back onto bed). I liked the lav location in the cabin vice galley area. I was surprised that transfer at DOH was worse than at the old airport; bus to and from aircraft and a ridiculously long walk to gate D24 to get bus. Terminal was crowded and confusing; not enough staff or signs to help. My biggest negative is that Qatar Airways has decreased quality and quantity of onboard catering since my last flight. Cheaper Champagne, less choice of food, no celeb chef dishes. Full cabins on both sectors meant my choices had gone by the time I wanted to eat. All I got was a bowl of muesli 1 hr from DOH and 6 pieces of sushi 2 hrs before HND, not good for 13 hours in Business class."

This was my first long haul flight in a few years, we arrived very late at the airport and only had a few minutes until check in closed. The Qatar Airways staff were waiting for us as we were the last passengers to check in, we were very short on time and the staff escorted us to the security check and managed to get us fast tracked through security so we didn't miss our flight. We boarded the plane and were greeted by the nicest crew I have encountered on a flight. Our first leg of our flight was roughly 7 hours to Doha. The plane was clean and very stylish throughout each seating class. Shortly after take off we were served breakfast which consisted the most amazing meal on an airline. We were served Waffles with strawberries and cream, We also received a hot bread roll, fruit salad, yogurt, water and fresh juice and coffee. After we were served our meal, the cabin was cleared of the breakfast and we could sit back and relax. The inflight entertainment system was great and had hundreds of movies, TV Shows, music, games to keep you happy for the long flight. A few hours into the flight we were served lunch. The food on this airline is some of best. We landed in Doha with a short 4 hour layover which was just enough to explore Qatar Airways hub airport which is a fantastic place. The flight from Doha to Kuala Lumpur was to the same high standards and we arrived in Kuala Lumpur feeling relaxed and refreshed. The seat pitch was very good and seats were wide, aircraft was clean and all staff were excellent. The best flight I have ever taken."

Tedious announcements and commercials onboard disturbs the experience. Food and drink service was less, options, smaller portions, less meals (no servings before landing in BKK on this flight).

Food portions diminishing, but 3 still options for dinner/lunch on economy remain. Wines have now been reduced from four choices a month ago till now only two, red or white - both are mediocre though of Chilean provenances. The most annoying are the lengthy bus cattle-transfers at Doha (yes! They are still ongoing as the jet-bridges are far from sufficient). Secondly, endless announcements, advertisements, and even Qatar charity requests on passengers (""Educate a child"", ""support etc.."") disturbs the IFE systems to the extent of it becoming annoying and useless despite the good movies."

Comfortable and supportive seats and even at 1.84m enough space and so quiet. Service very attentive and polite, all on time and minimal time queuing to board aircraft. Entertainment system, again especially on A380, was excellent. Only great weakness was food - even by airline standards I found it terrible on all four flights - fatty meat, almost nothing green, frequently a stodgy pasty with paste inside referred to as chicken sandwich : not nutritious. Juices also terrible (processed juice drinks); didn't try wines. Such a shame given the service and aircraft quality. "

The ground service in KL was not good. Kuala Lumpur to Doha was on A330. Since the seat arrangement is 2-4-2, it's no problem for me as I was traveling with my sister. The journey was long but the service was excellent. The cabin crew were really attentive and polite, attending to our needs. On the next flight from Doha to Edinburgh, we boarded the Boeing 787 . The seating arrangement is 3-3-3 so this means we're seated with a stranger. But no matter, we had a good time. The cabin crew for this flight (7+ hours) were even better than the first. Our return flights were smoother, however, the flight crew from Doha to Kuala Lumpur were less friendly, loud, and noisy in the cabin.  The food were excellent especially the breakfast and lunch. The snacks though could be improved. I'd rather have a sandwich than the pastry (thick dough) sandwich. Overall, I had a wonderful experience flying with Qatar Airways."

The seats were comfortable, got a packet with tooth brush, tooth paste and an eye mask. I also got a blanket and pillow. There was enough room for me to stretch my legs out. Good choice of movies and shows. I was disappointed with food, not much of a choice on the menu and didn't have enough for 11 hour flight. One point they were handing out chicken sandwiches but turned out to be a pastry filled with mush. Staff were okay, they weren't smiling. At least 8 hours into the flight, they eventually handed out small bottles of water. But flight was good, no turbulence, smooth landing in Doha. I was looking forward to a flight on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner but they changed it to a Boeing 777-300er. London to Doha I flew the A380. Great aircraft, good legroom for economy, food was sort of the same, except they handed out a decent chocolate bar. Entertainment systems newer than the 777. They were great, I watched a few movies and slept most of the time. Then another smooth landing at Doha. I was impressed of the A380. Another Boeing 777-300ER from Doha to Perth.  A kid in front of me pushed his seat back on boarding and cabin crew walked by and did nothing until takeoff. Once we took off, the seat came down again for the whole flight. It was difficult to eat food and watch Tv. This plane, my entertainment system would not respond, couldn't press anything without it glitching."

Excellent flights and lounge at Doha. Boeing 787 and A380 seats are the same. But strangely the IFE on the Boeing was nowhere near as extensive as the A380. My wife ordered a veggie meal and the first flight she asked if she could choose something from the regular menu, as the flight was full the answer was no. No problem - but she only received three courses instead of five. Second sector on A380 she could choose anything. The return sector she cancelled the special meal and it was much more enjoyable. On board champagne has changed since I flew QR back in the Spring. Jaquart was offered in the Business cabin, it was okay but the Taittinger Comtres de Chanpagne in the A380 lounge was much nicer. Aspire lounge used at Amsterdam was okay and better than the BA lounge next door. Overall besides Singapore Airlines, I have yet to experience a better Business class flight. Lesson learnt by my wife, don't order a special meal - plenty of veggie choices on the regular menu."

Flight to KUL was full but still very comfortable. Operated by a Boeing 777-200LR (A7-BBF) which again was in great condition and very clean. Flew back from Singapore on the A350 (A7-ALE). Didn't find the seats as comfortable as those on the A380 or Boeing 777 to be honest but was great to be on the A350 regardless. Final flight back to London on a Boeing 777-300ER. Had to move from my initial seat (26C) as the entertainment screen was not working. However the reassigned 36C meant I had the whole row to myself. Overall great crews and ground staff.

On the B787 there are IFE boxes underneath the seats reducing footspace quite a bit. The climate inside the aircrafts was most comfortable on the B787 where the air was not as dry.

Kathmandu to London Heathrow via Doha leaving KTM on October 30th. The original flight was at 1230 from KTM with connecting flight at 1720 out of DOH to LHR. Whilst trekking in Nepal, the daily flights were consolidated due to fuel problems at KTM with the new flight now at 1610. We were unaware of this and went to check-in at 0930 (along with others who were unaware of the change). Qatar Airways had staff in position, re-booked the whole journey efficiently and found seats on the DOH to LHR flight at 0630 next day - the young man stated that accommodation etc would be supplied at DOH and lunch was also given to us at KTM. All in all a generally pleasant wait ensued. Upon arrival at DOH , the QR transfer/hotel desk needed firm handling as they denied that a hotel was needed, a voucher for a pizza or similar was acceptable and a wait of 11 hours at the airport was ok etc - after meaningful discussions, hotel and dinner was supplied for a number of pax on the consolidated flight and everything was deemed satisfactory. What a shame that QR wasted so much time with tired and fractious pax denying accommodation and food - Kathmandu staff acknowledged the problem and handled the matter with speed, courtesy and efficiency only to have DOH staff cause stress. Well handled by Kathmandu, let down by Doha."

The seat configuration on this flight was 2x2 in business class and there were 12 business class seats on A321 aircraft. My headset was dysfunctional. After a mundane meal service, I dozed off. We got to Hamad International Airport and proceeded to the Al Mourjan Lounge. The lounge was pretty packed, we were lucky enough to find a table at the restaurant and ordered the fillet steak, disappointing that the steak was overdone. Service was great in the Al Mourjan Lounge.  We transferred to the area near the family rooms to take a shower. The lounge staff informed us it was the final call for boarding at our gate so we rushed to find out that boarding haven't commenced yet and there was no separate boarding area for business class. Right after take off, I fell into a slumber. Three hours later, a female cabin crew approached us and asked for our meal preference. I have to commend her for attentively paying attention to what we needed. She was at our beck and call so for that, she deserves proper credits. Cabin crew service was exceptionally five star class. Despite that, they need to step it up when it comes to food selection and quality at lounges and boarding service. "

Our seats were in row 6 in front of the lavatories. The aircraft departed with a slight delay at Doha and arrived at Frankfurt ahead of the scheduled arrivak time. The seat comfort of Qatar Airways lie flat seats is very comfortable. The aircraft looked and is of course pretty new. The flight attendants worked professionally. Food and beverages were great and meals were served at the time the passenger prefers. Overnight kits from Armani and complimentary pyjamas were provided.

We had a confirmed seat reservation in row 82 which was changed by the ground staff to row 32 on the upper deck of the 380. The seat comfort is a bit worse in comparision of the previous flight on an A350, but it was still good. The onboard service and food and beverage were good as well, and so was the onboard entertainment system. The aircraft was fully booked with only a few seats left vacant. The lavatories and the interieur of the A380 were clean and pretty new."

The inflight entertainment remote control on one seat didn't work properly at the beginning but the flight attendants got it fixed. The business class was fully booked. Every passenger was asked by the crewmembers at the end of flight about their impressions or if they would like to complain.

Three of the longer flight sectors were on the new A380. I prebooked a seat in the upstairs economy zone on all flights, which proved to be a good choice. This zone was small but quiet and very spacious. I thought the seating was one of the best I have been on in Economy class. The staff, food and entertainment were all top notch. Its also a plus to fly via the new airport in Doha, very easy to navigate unlike Dubai."

Doha to Bangkok I got other seats. It was not possible to receive my wheelchair in Doha. I had to use an airport wheelchair which was too small. The transfer to my seat was also not very professional with their right equipment. On the way back in BKK I didn't get the confirmed seat. I got a seat (43D A380) with unmoveable armrests and it was difficult to sit down. The food was on both legs the same and the bar service was good.

Very impressed with the economy service and product offering on Qatar Airways on their brand new A380 and A350 aircraft. Aircraft spotlessly clean on both legs. Seating the same on both aircraft, very comfortable with good legroom and reasonable seat width. Felt more cramped on the A350. Crew professional and friendly on both legs. Good meal services on both flights, although I note on daylight flights in this case London to Doha the meal service and offering is much more extensive than on the early morning flights 0230am from Doha to Singapore. Inflight entertainment good and extensive choice not just of Western movies/tv but content from around the world. The Oryx IFE system they use is not that user friendly and can be clumsy. 15 minutes free wifi offered on both flights, but no point in using as the system times out constantly. Bathrooms kept clean throughout both flights. Only real negatives about experience, very long and drawn out safety announcements done in both Arabic and English but not simultaneously, way too much advertising of Qatar Airways, Qatar banks etc. Inflight entertainment interrupted too many times with charity videos and arrival videos for Doha. The new Doha airport for economy class passengers very bland, very poor food outlet choices, expensive shops, but lack of sitting area, shower and rest facilities for such a major global hub."

Excellent service at check-in in Noi Bai International Airport. NIA Business Lounge in T2 is very good and spacious. Onboard proactive FAs provide a good mood and proper care. The product has changed slightly in recent months in economy class with smaller food portions though 3 options are offered on menu card. Champagne is not served in economy class but an amenity kit is still provided. Excellent language skills among the crew. All flights on time. Reliability and precision of the airline high. FAs are professional, fresh, and often in a sparkling mood. I never had experienced a significant delay with Qatar Airways, but am annoyed by eternal bus-transfers in Doha. HIA was supposed to have this improved but I do not see much change nor direct gate access. Onboard the worst part is the the slow safety video, lengthy, numerous commercials (esp. on tourism, banking, and HIA glamourisation). Even worse are QR charity initiatives which are imposed on all passengers. Drink rounds have been less on my flights and are no separate round offered prior to meals - which can be delayed for 1-2 hours into the flight"

This is the first time for us to fly Qatar Airways since we've been flying Cathay Pacific for such a long time. There was barely a queue on business class. I approached a QR staff and asked if she could resolve my FFP issue. She was able to encode CX on the system. At least I was happy that my mileage earnings would be credited to my Marco Polo Account. We were then given our boarding pass and lounge access. We queued for the Immigration Checks, and that took us an hour for us to get through. When we get to the line for one particular immigration officer, there were like 6 people ahead of us and it took her forever to deal with each one of them. When it was our turn, it took less than 5 minutes.  We walked like a couple of minutes to get to the PAGS Lounge and it appeared like the old Cathay Pacific Lounge - I was then told learned this was the old CX Lounge which needs a serious revamp! We were welcomed onboard warmly, although disappointed to see the seat configuration was 2-2-2. I was hoping that it was 1-2-1. Service was impeccable - simply impeccable.  We preferred to have dinner an hour after take off. And when the meal service was on, I got so delighted with the breads. The Arabian Mezze was spot on and I got the second glass of Australian Shiraz. Unfortunately, the entrée was mundane.  I would prefer a third glass of Shiraz and nuts over the main. Dessert was available, but I opted to get the cheese platter to pair with my Shiraz and it was divine. We touched down at Hamad International Airport at 9.30 in the evening. Deplaned and worked through to the transfer desk for the in-city accommodation which was provided by Qatar Airways. We checked in and were given a room at the top floor, the accommodation was decent. The toiletries were L'Occitane. After a quick shower, we dozed off as the wake up call is at 4am. At 4am, we got the wake up call and checked out. The airport transfer chauffeur took us back to the airport and it was like a breeze going through immigration and security checks. We tried the Qatar Airways Al Mourjan Lounge. When I entered, I got astounded with the sheer opulent details. The high ceiling, the furnishings and all that. Basing everything on In-Flight Service not the seat configuration and design and the whole experience, I would fly Qatar Airways Business class on my next long-haul flight."

Very pleasant flights helped by being able to have three seats to myself on both flights. Staff pleasant if not overly friendly. Food okay on Perth to Doha segment. Breakfast on leaving Doha much better but pastry and savoury snack before landing in Edinburgh not great. Doha Airport good on quiet midweek morning but quite expensive for food and drinks. Onward connection from Edinburgh to Belfast straightforward as bags checked all the way through and just needed to pick up boarding pass from flybe staff. Overall a very easy way to connect to Northern Ireland from Australia."

The business class product is still excellent, and the crew was friendly and attentive as usual. Small things are cut back, the amuse bouche from Oslo, drink after takeoff, amenity kit. Still value for money. One thing that annoys is the IFE remote which is sluggish and unresponsive, unless you by chance touch it with your elbow - not very smart placement in the seat. DOH to BKK they do a full dinner menu, very slow on a flight that leaves after midnight. I gave up and went to sleep. Tried the on board lounge for canapés, but they only had nuts. "

We are Oneworld Ruby card holders so from the time of booking got access to reserving seats which was great. Our first flight was on the A380 so we got seats reserved in the small cabin at the back of the upper deck (only 7 or 8 rows). When we checked our bags we were able to use Business class check in (Oneworld benefit was honoured! However the seats we had chosen months ago were changed when we tried online check in and I could not change them. Frustrating that the agent at the desk could not change this back and we were referred to another desk to the flight supervisor who to be fair despite arguing with me about ""accepting"" those seats when I checked in online, did change them to our original preference. I was grateful for this and thanked her. Onboard the seat on the A380 is really good. Thin seat, but comfortable and plenty of personal space including legroom. The recline is very good, but thankfully for me no one in front other wise it would have been in my face. There's a decent sized IFE screen and a reasonable choice of movies. Despite this cabin only being half full it took about 90 mins before we were offered any service which was lunch. Nice enough, but the entree portion was small, and drinks were offered with the meal almost like an afterthought. Throughout the flight the crew were friendly and responsive if you asked for more drinks, but not proactive. Close to arrival we were served a wrap and muffin which were nice. Transferring at Hamad international was a breeze, you literally walk through a supervised glass door straight back into the departure lounge (it is different on your return). Really nice modern and relatively quiet airport at 7pm local time. For westerners there is nice French themed bar and restaurant that serves alcohol in the departure lounge. The second leg to Abu Dhabi was less than an hour in duration. The seat comfort was fine on the Boeing 777-300 and it had IFE if you wanted it. The crew served a savoury pastry and cake with a cuplet of orange juice.  Overall the experience felt good value for money, albeit I wasn't bowled over given the 5 star experience I was expecting. I just think they could have made a massive impact if they'd provided a more proactive service on the upper deck economy section of the A380"

First flight on Al Maha branded A320. Check in was fine and like our outbound flights our Oneworld ruby status was honoured and despite travelling in economy we checked in at the business class desk. On board this aircraft the legroom was really tight and I'm glad we only had less than a one hour flight. This Al Maha configuration has no seat back IFE, but this was not a problem as the flight was so short. We were served a savoury pastry and cake and a cuplet of orange juice. We arrived at Hamad International a few minutes early and the transfer process was quick and slick. Handbaggage X-Ray and personal metal detector screening. Relaxing time back in the departure lounge. Boarding was stress free as they do it by seating zone for economy. The seat was comfortable on the Boeing 777-300 and legroom more than adequate for a 7 hour flight. In common with my outbound flight the service was slow, over an hour before any service (we were in the third row of economy cabin). Dinner was nice, but entree portions are small. Drinks only served with dinner. After this you could get more drinks if you asked but the crew were not proactive offering anything other than occasional glasses of water or orange juice. Close to arrival a savoury pastry and cake accompanied by orange juice were served. I'd fly Qatar Airways again at the right price point, but I'm struggling to see why they are rated 5-star."

First flight on Boeing 777, Doha to Bangkok on the A380. Both flights with excellent service and food. Seating on Boeing 777 okay, terrible on A380. My review concerns the latter part of the trip. We were late arriving at DOH - no explanation or apology. So we were then late at the departure gate, where our boarding passes were checked 4 times - with the staff standing in sight of each other - crazy. The seats on the A380 lower deck were cramped and legroom was short. At least one person had their dinner tipped in their lap from inconsiderate 'seat recliners' in front. When the pax in front of me reclined their seat, I couldn't watch my screen. I wear glasses, and with the screen so close to my face I couldn't focus. Sleeping was not comfortable, with my knees jammed against the seat in front (I'm average build, 5'10 height). When are airlines in cramped economy class, going to restrict the amount seats recline?"

Upon arrival at Doha we whisked into the Lovely Business class lounge and had enough time for a cup of Dilmah tea (Ceylon) before boarding the A340 to Colombo. This second plane was spacious and very comfortable. The new configuration and seats are excellent with lovely flat beds and plenty of room. Staff were outstanding as was service, food and beverages. Our return to London was on another A340 followed by an A380. Both flights also had excellent, attentive staff. Qatar Airways were extremely helpful, polite and accessible at all times.

Check in at Manchester business desk took only a few minutes then on to the Escape lounge which was quite full, perhaps one day Qatar will have their own lounge in Manchester and maybe a complimentary Chauffeur service. Boarded and a member of cabin crew asked about drinks while others introduced themselves, always a nice touch, took off virtually on time. A330 is a nice aircraft, small business class section with comfortable seats, decent selection of movies, food very good as usual on Qatar. Arrived Hamad International a few minutes ahead of time and disembarked into airport, no bus. As I had a few hours to spare went to the Al Mourjan lounge until gate for Bangkok advised. Bangkok flight on the A380, some of the departure gates designed with this aircraft in mind as separate business class gate and upstairs lounge to board direct to upper section. Much bigger business section with 48 seats, very comfortable but strange seats no arm rest of the left hand side until you reclined the seat. Good flight, again managed to sleep for a short time before arriving at Bangkok. Return flights just as good despite an 8 hours transit in Doha (more about that in the lounge review) I always get messed up with the different Airbus A330 models but the one from Doha to Manchester was different from the first flight, looked a little older and smaller. I can’t praise the Qatar crews on all four flights enough, brilliant service with maybe the best food on any airline. The only thing that spoilt a perfect trip was that between Bangkok and Manchester my case was damaged in three different areas, it looked like to main damage was done by the wheels of another case."

Qatar Airways 1x2x1 business class layout on the A380 top deck means every seat has aisle access. They are angled away from the aisle to make them more private, have lots of storage space (plus big overhead bins) and are very comfortable. There are two toilets at the front and two at the back and the lounge area (which surprisingly didn't seem to be used much) makes the whole area feel spacious. Passengers in the small economy section at the rear of the top deck are entirely separate and not allowed to use the lounge or wander through the business area. The cabin service and food was faultless. Qatar Airways cabin staff are specifically trained for the A380 and it certainly shows. A nice touch is that each passenger has a designated crew member who introduces him/herself before take off and says goodbye before landing. The A320 has old style business class seats but these were fine for relatively short flights."

Check in at Schiphol was quick and polite directed to the Aspire lounge - a 3rd party lounge which is fine although busy. Boarding on time by class, once onboard the service was 2nd to none! The seat on the Boeing 787 (2A) was comfortable a great environment. The crew on this flight I could not fault and neither could I fault the food which was presented well and tasted great.

The standard of cuisine and other catering was very high, but they did seem to run out of things early in each flight. Maybe they shouldn't over play dining options and (wonderful) spirit and wine choices. The rose champagne was finished before take off in AMS. Being patriotic I ordered a Glenfiddich as my post departure drink from SGN and there wasn't any. The Meursault wine was finished after one glass out of AMS and SGN. On each occasion I was told they would try to get me my dining options subject to what their colleague had been asked for in the other aisle. I formed the impression that there was calculated stocking of food and using up depleted stocks of their excellent drinks cellar. I spoke to the cabin director on one matter. The business class seat layout of the Boeing 787 is 1x2x1. My wife and I sat in the middle with the children on either side. It was clear we were travelling together but they could not comprehend that my wife and I would want to dine together and insisted that we take service at different times from different crew.

Always fly Qatar and would suggest to anyone to fly them and join privilege club frequent flyer program, as got an upgrade to business for the flights for having enough qmiles."

At Narita, Qatar Airways  ground service is operated by partner Japan Airlines, quick and efficient for check in and luggage. Lounge is comfortable and quiet but food offer is rather poor as often in Japan. Long walk to the gate but we had been warned it would take 10 minutes. Easy boarding, on a Boeing 777, nice welcome by a crew member who showed us to our seats. Same comfort and lie flat bed as on the outward flight. I chose more international food, it was a light dinner due to late departure (10pm), nothing fantastic but good and nice presentation, all dishes brought to your seat, no trolley up and down the aisle. I watched two films. Could sleep well and had ordered a light breakfast which was served 90 mins before landing. Arriving at Doha at 4am, access by jetway but long way to walk, time to walk to the lounge, hardly anybody there, it was 0430 - went upstaors to restaurant which starts at 5am. Could get some tea at once then chose the buffet which I found more attractive than a la carte menu. I had a nice full breakfast out of a large choice of western and oriental style products. Then a shower, no waiting, though lounge was getting more crowded with several flights arriving. 4hr layover went as a breeze, with waiting time in a quiet and comfortable place, with good wifi connection and power socket to charge iphone and ipad. I got boarding information by SMS than on the airport screen so started to move to gate on time as it was very far, 15 minutes walk including moving sidewalks to get there. Boarding by bus, one reserved to business class passengers. Same welcome on board Boeing 787. Crew took orders for meal - chose an arabic breakfast as it was 9am and some extra things such as french pastries. I don't drink alcool and did not watch IFE except the flight route. Twice crew asked if I wanted extra drinks or food. Landing at Stockholm, some walk thru immigration to reach luggage delivery, our cases arrived on belt less than 5 minutes after we had been there. Both flights, as both outbound flights were exactly on time. I was a bit worried with the luggage after reading some comments, but this service deserves full marks - except lounge of airline partners in NRT and ARN. I certainly fly Qatar Airways again."

I usually fly Air France but got bored with low quality and tried QR because of special business class offer for flights from Europe. Only negative point was lounge in Stockholm that is small, not that comfortable with very basic food offer. All the rest was great. A brand new Boeing 787 from Stockholm to Doha, day flight, lovely food, nice crew. Arrived in Doha around 5pm, bus transfer, special bus for business, transfer to terminal building took just a few minutes. Doha Airport is huge and we missed direction to the lounge but very helpful staff to show the way. The lounge in Doha was comfortable with large offer for food either downstairs or at restaurant upstairs, lounge was busy, we had 8 hours layover but we found a comfortable place to sit, and rest with excellent wifi connection. Could have a shower without having to wait, nice dinner in restaurant before boarding for Tokyo NRT around 1am. Boeing 777 from DOH to NRT, not so sophisticated seat than on Boeing 787 but somehow more roomy and very comfortable. Both flights with full flat bed. Food on board second flight was great, possible to order anything from the menu anytime. I just had a light treat after take off and chose the Japanese meal before arriving in Tokyo, great Japanese Kaiseki food. Gangway to reach the terminal, some walk , no waiting at immigration, and luggage arrived 5 minutes after we had reached the delivery hall. We could be in the Narita express to Tokyo 45 minutes. I won't comment wines and alcohol either onboard or at the lounge as I do not drink any, and no comment on IFE as I prefer to read or sleep, but their flight info and maps are very sophisticated and I left it on all the way thru. Great company and great value for price."

I'm 5'10"" tall but could not reach the air vents. The flight passed reasonably well until meal time. I was treated to their cooked breakfast on the sector from Doha to London. It might almost have been palatable (ignoring the dreaded chicken sausage), were it not for the fact that I had had that same breakfast on the flight from Bangkok to Doha.  They offer snacks on their flights, in this case a Mars bar and crisps, which I found greasy. I was offered a choice of sandwiches : lamb or chicken, but instead found heated pastry parcels containing minced who-knows-what. "

I usually fly Business and or First class but on this occasion I had decided to travel to Thailand at extremely short notice (roughly 3 hours), so therefore my business partner accidentally booked tickets in economy. Which is not usually my preference when taking a flight. Yet I could not find fault with the level of service I received on each flight and in particular the flight QR9 from Doha to London, was simply exceptional. I cannot thank the cabin crew of Qatar Airways enough for making what could have easily been a set of nightmare journeys for myself. In the end, amazing. If you are considering booking with Qatar Airways and find yourself somewhat hesitant due to having read some of the bad reviews, I would ask you to consider the fact that when It comes to reviews of anything you can be almost certain that they tend to be completely polarised viewpoints. And as such you should treat them with a pinch of salt. Go with an open mind, you'll probably find your flight just fine. Or allow yourself to enjoy it despite little problems and you might, like me feel the need to write a review because it was such a great experience."

IFE System was the new Oryx which had every movie one would like. They even featured cartoons and TV serials for kids in all languages with subtitles.

My expectations were high after all their ads about 5 stars airline etc, and I'm glad to say we would agree with most of that. Boeing 777 was comfortable and clean, and surprisingly the lavs were clean the 2 times I used them. A full meal and snack served, which was more than enough for what was not a very long flight. Inflight entertainment was great, but when will airlines stop the dreadful ads that they inject every time you stop, start etc. Doha airport was big, but found it quite easy to make our transfer, and enjoyed some great coffee there while waiting - it was busy though! Cabin crew were a mixed bunch of nationalities and types, but generally we found them friendly and obliging, and efficient - reminded me a bit of the Lufthansa no-nonsense efficiency.

We were delayed 2 hours because a passenger onboard wasn't feeling well as the plane was taxiing out. Instead of offloading this passenger, the captain decided to wait for a doctor to treat them. The passenger was found to be fit to travel and we departed 2 hours late. This meant we missed our connecting flight at Doha for the onward leg to the Maldives. What made us angry was that our connecting flight was still on the ground at Doha when we landed, but couldn't be held for a short time to allow connecting passengers to board. On arrival we were presented with transfer and hotel vouchers as we disembarked at Doha at 7.30am. We were not allowed to retrieve luggage and were taken by minibus to a hotel on the outskirts of Doha (the Golden Ocean), which seemed like a 2 star hotel. We tried to sleep but this proved impossible as the hotel is situated next to a building site - there was constant drilling and hammering all day long.  Not having access to any of our luggage compounded the misery, as we couldn't change into clean clothes. We were collected at 10pm for the flight to the Maldives which departed at 1am. No member of staff apologised at any time - we felt abandoned. We missed 2 nights sleep in a row and arrived at our holiday destination shattered.  We spent the holiday fretting about the return journey, as the connection time was a mere 55 minutes, and we dreaded missing it. The final insult was being told our flight from Doha back to London was departing late because it was waiting for some passengers coming in on a delayed flight. "

The prices in Doha Duty Free often substantially higher than shops in many countries. QR lounges outside of Doha are substandard. There is only one lounge in DOH so if you are flying from a remote gate you have miles to walk. The downstairs gate I used (E26-30 I think) is like a zoo and they expect you to sit and wait till the flight has boarded before putting you on the business class bus.

Food is served, but without wine at the same time. When I requested a glass it never arrived. I consequently left my main course untouched. Although my partner's meal service was better on his side of the aisle, he only received his glass of wine after he had finished eating lunch.  Arrival in DOH allowed for sufficient time to shower and have a drink and snacks in the Business Class lounge.

It is Doha to Bangkok, the Boeing 777-300ER which has a 2x2x2 seat configuration in Business Class. My seat was 2A which is a window seat. The is plenty of room in these seats. They have lie flat seats, tons of leg room, storage in front of you, large overhead compartments, cheerful flight attendants, great service. The seat has a large TV monitor where you can watch all kinds of first run movies - over 50 choices. Games, music, plenty to entertain you if you don't want to sleep. It is a night flight, quiet and dark, so easy to sleep. The amenity kit is excellent. They serve a snack and 6 hours later breakfast. The food was ok, beverages the usual, including alcohol. The plane was fairly clean, pillows and blankets are comfortable. The seats have a small, flexible reading light. I don't remember if they have plugs for your phone/computer, but I think they do. All in all, it was very comfortable for a semi-long flight - it is only a little over 6 hours. The best part of being in Business class is when you get off in Bangkok, you get to go through priority immigration and visa! I sped right through. I would definitely recommend Business Class, you get what you pay for."

J Singh",Boeing 777-300 / A330 / A321,4th September 2015,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Melbourne to Athens via DOH,August 2015,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,4,yes,9,"Qatar Airways evening departure from Melbourne to Doha was on time and hassle free. Boeing 777 cabin very spacious, clean and quiet. Service attentive and friendly without being fawning. Great to have pyjamas and a lie flat bed. Doha Airport has bus transfers to terminal upon arrival, which is mildly annoying. It was a very quick transit time, so got a 20 minute refesh in the lounge, which looked great and was well staffed and serviced. Doha to Athens on an A330. Out of the four legs I had, it was the newest plane, but my least favorite - seating is tight and cabin crowded. Return to Doha from Athens on an A321, which had only angled seats but was more comfortable than A330. Being a 4-hour day flight also helped. Dinner was superb on this leg. Return to Melbourne was on time, and with comfortable lie flat Boeing 777 seats, I got a good nights rest. IFE in general was a bit hit and miss and the Boeing 777 screens were not the best. Overall though, Qatar Airways experience as good as any I have had."

On the route from Doha to Madrid in Boeing 787, noteworthy is the wonderful work of the hostesses. Unbeatable, great care about the menu, the atmosphere in the cabin. Also perfect flight sector on July 31 from Madrid to Doha.

The food was good, seats were as expected, but flights to and from Manchester were full of children (as well as the short Riyadh flights), and sleep was impossible. They use an electronic menu, for which they interrupted the IFE for 30 minutes. Toilets were a mess."

I wanted a bit of comfort during the flight and I was surprised to see Qatar Airways was the cheapest 1 stop option. The food and beverage selections from Copenhagen to Doha was excellent in a nicely equipped Boeing 787. Crew could have ben a bit more friendly at times. The exact opposite was the case from Doha to Seoul, where the food could have been better, but the crew were excellent and helpful. Seats and legspace were what you would expect from economy, but not too bad either as there was a free seat in our middle row in both legs of the flight. I did not check the Wifi connectivity as I did not want to pay for it. Overall a very pleasant experience."

This gave me problems at Zagreb, because I was not allowed to collect my bag and check them to Sarajevo, since I did not have a Shengen Visa. Qatar Airways onboard service was good. The flight attendants were pleasant and I had a smooth transfer in Doha."

Lee Hitchens",,30th August 2015,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Phuket to Manchester via Doha,August 2015,3.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,,3,no,5,"I am travelling back from a month vacation in Phuket with my wife and two children.  When we travelled to Phuket in July we found our six year old daughter had no child meals booked. I had booked this online but it failed to register. The staff were apologetic on the plane and said they would sort the issue for when we returned in four weeks. When we arrived in Phuket we found one of our cases had not arrived. This delayed us at the airport while we had to sort this issue. On checking in online for the return journey we find our family split, with my son 20 rows back from the rest of us on the last sector. The check in staff tried to adjust this but could do nothing better than move him slightly closer.  We found our daughter had no child menu on the plane and appeared to be the only one that failed to get a child gift when they were handed out. We asked later and were told all gifts had been handed out. In Doha the airport doesn't have a Priority pass lounge. I know things happen in isolation and cannot be helped, but good customer services should do their best to make it up to their customers by making them feel wanted and needed. "

The great option with Qatar Airways is that they fly from DWC not DXB which is a superb option. Small airport, you are through from check in to the gate in literally 5 minutes same on the return airside to landside taxi rank. I find Qatar Airways a quality consistent airline, this trip was no different, flights on time, in all directions. DWC to KTM via Doha, staff all pleasant this was a red eye, so sleep was the main requirement but unfortunetly with the aircraft used was not an option. A320 on a 4.5 hour night flight with non flat seats does not make for a comfortable sleep zone. So this was a negative. Crew onboard generally are polite, efficient but have a feeling of being robotic, they don't know how to be personable with passengers. On all sectors there was no priority business check in or priority boarding, all aircraft were at remote stands. Food and beverage good - but fail to understand why Mezze and lamb are on every menu! Overall good but could do better."

There was no priority boarding for business class from Cairo. The flight attendants were perfunctory with me (a single female student traveling), but lavished attention on the male travelers.  When the IFE malfunctioned before takeoff, I was tersely instructed not to touch the remote for 15 minutes, as if it were my fault. Thankfully, the excellent food and drink made up for the service. On arrival in Doha, everything improved. There was a separate waiting area to board the plane to Paris, my flight attendant was amazingly attentive and detail oriented - putting away my carry-on for me, explaining the menu and the seat, and asking me when I wanted to dine, and introducing herself to me by name. When I had my pre-landing meal, another flight attendant observed that I enjoyed my smoothie, and offered me another one, even though he wasn't my assigned flight attendant. That was the service I was expecting when I booked Qatar Airways. The seat and IFE on the A380 was better than any airline I've flown before. All of the Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings movies, and new releases were loaded, in addition to European, Indian, Asian, and Arab film selections."

All very good flights, except narrow seats (I was in 10 row, so no problem with seat pitch, but even in window seat - slightly wider than middle - was narrow) in B787 (in B777 much, much better, even A320 was better) and the same children meals both ways from Doha (omelette with some sausage). Normal meal good (especially pancakes). This time no problem with IFE, but on B787 much fewer options than on B777. Very nice Cabin Staff on all 4 flights. Unfortunately in Doha 3 times there was bus to/from airplane but although B777 boarding take long time all flights was almost (one flight was 15 minutes late) on time. Good price. Really recommended."

Staff are very friendly, drinks are high quality wines and champagnes. Connection time is very good, boarding is taken care of very well. New Airport is also good and the lounge is first class. The only negative I can add is that Qatar should offer complimentary internet in Business Class."

Qatar Airways A350 business class is top-notch. A wonderful, quiet and nicely decorated plane. Windows seem to be larger than other aircraft. The seat is maybe a bit narrow but I got the single one which means a lot of privacy for some good rest and sleep. Cabin crew was excellent and so was the food. Restrooms are very nice and were kept clean throughout the entire flight. Have not given a try to onboard WiFi. Anyway, in my opinion this WiFi service should be free of charge for business class passengers. Doha to Venice onboard an older A330-200, but the service and food were just as great as the previous segment. The more I transit through Hamad airport in Doha the more I appreciate its modernity and huge business class lounge."

The cabin crew members were friendly and offered great service. The seating was comfortable and I was able sleep with no problems. The vegetarian meal was okay.

We are five - myself, husband plus three little ones, aged from 2 to 9 years old. My biggest concern would be to manage the demands of the kids during the long haul flights. To my surprise, not only have I enjoyed the hospitality and services provided by Qatar Airways, but also have my three kids. The entertainment system was great and kept them entertained for long periods of time. Child meal was excellent. And sleeping time was perfect for us, with horizontal reclining seats, operated by the kids themselves. I was able to read a whole book, enjoyed my meals at time of my convenience.  My husband enjoyed the trip as much as I did. I would like to register my high appreciation for such friendly cabin crew and ground staff - second to none. Hamad Airport in Doha is a must go one day during anyone's life."

Check-in at Frankfurt Airport was smooth and the Qatar Airways staff were friendly. I had chosen 29A for myself, which was extremely convenient. The cabin was airy and chilly (the way I like!), middle seat was vacant which gave me extra room to enjoy the collection of movies and music on the IFE. A good collection of Hollywood as well as Bollywood movies, and songs encompassing all genres was a treat. The seats looked new and the cabin was very clean. I had ordered a Hindu non-vegetarian meal for myself, which was surprisingly palatable, especially the chicken curry with the coconut base. Service fantastic, I was in the mood for some Ginger Ale, and the stewardess was extremely polite and kind enough to serve it to me within no time. I highly recommend the A350 flight on the FRA-DOH route"

Service, seats and punctuality outstanding. The new Hamad Airport in Doha is by far the best in the Middle East. Return flight was a different story; last minute change to an aging A330-300, flight was overbooked and due to the different seating configuration, lots of dramas at the gate because seating allocation had to change for almost everyone. Due to the chaos, flight departed late, and I almost missed my connecting flight from Doha to Abu Dhabi. Overall a good product, well superior over Etihad Airways, who charges a premium for very mediocre seats and services."

They start with the first meal 2 hours after take-off and the second meal 2.5 hours before landing!  I enjoyed the generous luggage allowance and good work of ground service. Not a 5-star experience. There was inconsistency between the flights. DOH-SIN had a paper menu, WAW-DOH an electronic one which was displayed after crew started serving food.

As we had pre-booked a safari and in order to connect to a flight from Doha to Kili, we were compelled to change our arrival time to 22nd July resulting in two additional nights at our expense. The flight was good. Plenty of leg space on the aircraft (economy) and very friendly and helpful staff. Excellent food (unlike Qantas where food served to Economy Class passengers on Qantas has been reduced).

Massive queues breaching out of the entrance with staff not having a clue who is coming and going. The security queues are worse and a bigger joke (being business class I avoided them through FastTrack). Once making my way to the Qatar counter, it was fantastic from there onwards. Check-in of our luggage was smooth, the aircraft departed on time. Seats in the Boeing 787 are at a funny angle but very comfortable and true lie-flat. Meals were well presented and not stodgy. IFE was excellent, perhaps not as good as Emirates. The cabin crew were excellent with attention to detail and sometimes a bit too nice. The Doha business lounge is very good. Not busy and a decent selection of food (although some of it was pretty lukewarm). Boarding onwards to the Singapore flight (again the Boeing 787) was seamless and the FA were again fantastic and dished out pyjamas to sleep in.

What a difference in two weeks. The A340-600 is not a comfortable plane in business, but the food was outstanding, more like a Michelin Restaurant than a plane. The plane A7-AGC, was a little tired, IFE a bit hit and miss. The A330-200 from Clark to Doha had the new business class seats, fully flat unlike the outward journey. The food was excellent again. Has Qatar changed its chefs in the last two weeks. All journeys were on time and both arrived early. The lounge in Doha was fairly quiet, but again great service."

Check-in opens quite late, then, having purchased my ticket by Credit Card, an extremely long procedure for verifying the same is initiated, requiring my card and my passport to be taken to the office, while we wait at check-in.  Business Class lounge at the airport is quite modest - not at Qatar Airways level. On the plane, everything is positive, from the quality of the seat to the attentive, omnipresent service, to the dinner and breakfast served. Flight on their 787 is exceptionally smooth, one almost regrets that the flight is too short (around 8 hrs). "

Now that they fly from Edinburgh, I decided to give them another try, and I wasn't disappointed. From the minute we arrived at check-in, we were made to feel welcome. Similarly at boarding, the staff were attentive and wishing people a pleasant flight. On board the Dreamliner, the business cabin is superb. Each lie-flat seat is positioned so that it's like a little personal oasis, and is comfortable, fully adjustable, and with lots of little cubby-holes for your bits and pieces. You're also supplied with rather good noise-cancelling headphones, and an Armani amenity kit. These are waiting for you when you arrive, and they have different packs for male and female passengers. Pre take-off drinks are also served. The service on-board is impeccable - there's one flight attendant for four passengers, and the food is excellent. The menu is extensive and you can choose any items, as and when you please. The plane itself was smooth and quiet, and the attendants ensured that the toilets were always clean and well stocked. Despite a short 45 minute connection time, I was impressed by the new Hamad International airport, where we were whisked through security for our ongoing connection. I would thoroughly recommend Qatar Airways and it will be my airline of choice for future trips, even though Glasgow airport is more convenient for me."

Used the BA lounge in PHL which is underwhelming. Quick boarding and attendant was pleasant and proactive in our cabin. Served a chilled drink and towel and orders taken for lunch. They emphasise the fact that the meals are a la carte which means you can choose when you want to eat. The food was well presented visually but lacked flavour and I had to send back an over cooked chicken dish. There is a good wine selection. The seats on the 772 are spacious and are laid out in a 2-2-2 fashion. IFE was just okay, nothing special. They supply you with pyjamas, slippers, amenity kits and a thin 'mattress', duvet and pillow. I can't fault the service but the planes need a remodel in terms of the seat and configuration. The downside is the washrooms which in my opinion are no different from J class washrooms. The next sector was on an A332. Terrible seats, limited storage areas and no USB port! Again food was well presented but underwhelming in terms of what you pay for. All planes left on time. I would recommend this airline if the price is good for a C class cabin but interiors need upgrading."

Qatar Airways made us quite at home for our 20 hour flight. Food was plentiful, even to the point of over eating. We had a delay out of Philly due to rain, and with a short layover in Doha, we did not know if we'd make our connecting flight. Immigration was super fast, and they held the plane for us, though we literally got to the gate with 0 seconds to spare. All but 1 leg of our trip was about sold out, but the flight was not unbearable. We are in the process of booking our return to Phuket for 2016, and Qatar Airways is the airline of choice!"

Service and food was poor out of Manila Clark, but DOH-LHR route food was significantly better. Only issue is that the A330-300 seats are not flat bed like the Boeing 777, very difficult to sleep without feeling you are sliding off. Ground staff were good in Clark and solved a connection issue.

Having decided which movie to watch after lunch, not one of the new movies had been loaded onto the 787's IFE system - even 8 days after the start of the month. I then looked at the classical selection of the music channels. These are distinctly second rate in terms of choice - and not all are classical. IFE is one area where QR can definitely improve. Prior to take off on the second flight from Doha to BKK the FA asked about meal choices, reminding me the meal would served on demand as is QR's custom. I made it very clear I wished to sleep as long as possible on the 6 hour flight requesting merely orange juice, coffee and a croissant just prior to descent. We agreed this would be served one hour prior to landing. I was then awakened, raised my chair, threw my eye mask and ear plugs into the side bin as my orange juice was served only to realise there were in fact 2 hours of the flight remaining. The first comment was ""we are arriving early!"" which was not true. The second was that it was assumed I would need time to freshen up! Both inexcusable! On going to the aft toilet to change, the basin was clogged with filthy water and unusable. Then on asking for the complex landing cards required in Bangkok, I was informed they had not been loaded at Doha since they had had no stock for a week. Yet with 4 daily flights to/from BKK, surely the world's best airline could figure out a way to get a stack of them back to Doha!"

The first leg was on their 777-300 which after flying out on the 787 and A380 could not be as good, how wrong. The cabin is very spacious and like First class on other airlines. The seat arrangement is 2-2-2 with massive seats, about a metre of leg room/standing space and wide aisles. The seats are much more comfortable, especially in lie-flat than the new seats on the 787, A380 proving that older can be better. The service was excellent and all the staff new our names. There's a free Armani gift for male and female which are placed on the right seats before boarding, a nice touch. The food and drink options are not too impressive but I was quick to order as they ran out of some choices on our outbound flights. The second leg was on the new 787 Dreamliner. The seat arrangement is 1-2-1 but there's not as much room as on the 777 and not as comfortable as I discovered when I tried to sleep, this was an overnight leg. They provide a very thin mattress, a very comfy pillow and a nice blanket if you want to sleep, plus eye cover and earplugs are in your Armani gift set. I skipped the main meal as I'd just eaten in the lounge but I had the breakfast which was nice, with real cappuccino and fresh orange juice. All 4 legs (including my outbound) were on time with good service, overall a good first impression of Qatar after flying several times on Emirates."

In flight service was immaculate, superb dinner and wines (3 white and 3 red) served as and when requested, pajamas handed out and flat bed seats as comfortable as any in the air. Doha is a joy for transit passengers who do not have to bother with yet another security check. Lounge is huge with extensive facilities. The second flight was my first on a 787 and I was surprised - I found the experience less enjoyable that the 777. The herring-bone flat bed seat 1-2-1 layout seemed more cramped and I found no advantage in all the hyped up Dreamliner benefits. Still I slept much of the way. Arrived on time! For price, comfort, connections and the joy of not having to cope with Heathrow, Qatar Airways is almost impossible to beat"

Rob Bowden",Boeing 787,6th July 2015,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Brussels to Bangkok via Doha,June 2015,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,5,yes,8,"I recently flew to Bangkok from Brussels via Doha with Qatar in Business class. The main reason was price as they had a genuine buy one get one free companion sale and it was only £925 each when it was over £1800 from London. Check in was good but they share the British Airways Lounge, I've seen a lot of 1 out of 10's for British Airways on this site so enough said. The first leg was on the Qatar Airways 787 Dreamliner, the seat arrangement is 1-2-1 with only 5 rows so quite exclusive. The seats are cocoon, lie-flat bed style, fully remote controlled, with a big TV, desk, pull-out table, pillow etc and a nice welcome pack of eye cover, ear plugs, lip balm and some nice Armani products. The staff are excellent as to be expected from Qatar Airways but the menu and drinks options were not too impressive. However my wife enjoyed the pink champagne and I enjoyed their signature lime and mint juice pre-flight drinks. The inflight drinks options were limited unless you like wine, lots of wine choice. They don't carry enough of each meal so my wife and I did not get our first choice as we were sat in the back row of 5 they'd ran out! The second leg was on their brand new A380 with business class on the top deck. The seats and arrangement is the same as the 787 just more rows. The icing on the cake and by far the best selling point is the bar. The hostess on bar duty was lovely and made everyone welcome. There was a good choice of drinks and bar snacks, especially the individual carrot cakes. You get a fast pass before landing to avoid the hour long queue at passport control but no free chauffeur service, come on Qatar. Your bags get priority so they're on the carousel before you get there. Overall a good first impression although I was on their newest aircraft, can't wait to fly the new A350."

Cabin crew attentive and friendly. Very limited legroom, making the flight really uncomfortable when the flight is full as was the case on the BCN-DOH leg. I am a regular flyer and have found the legroom on all four flights to be exceptionally limited compared to other airlines. Serving of meals on the first two legs seemed disorganized. I was served my meal only two hours after the meal service started. On the second leg I received my meal relatively quickly, but the passengers sitting five rows ahead of me were only served about an hour later. I could not figure out the logic. Serving of meals on the return flights were well organized though."

Al Mourjan Lounge offered an a la carte options as well as buffet. However, all the menus were based on egg options during the breakfast. It was below what I expected. Qatar should have provided extensive options to their premium passengers based on the fact that these are passengers who are transitting through Doha and have travelled from all over the world within a 24hrs time zone. On baord service was excellent. You can choose your own time to be served. Compliments to the crew and purser who addressed every single customer by name. The seats lacked privacy and were not comfortable for sleeping. It was very narrow and my knees kept hitting the tray table everytime I tried to move to a different position. The same type of seats are also offered on their B787 and A350 aircarft. It was fine for a day flight, and also for lounging and working, but I would avoid this type of seats for a night flight. I had the best sleeping experience on their B777 aircarft. IFE system was ok. Menu options were limited and the quantity are so small. Onboard lounge served Krug Champagne even for JC passengers. However, things which are lacking on Qatar Airways for their FC and JC passengers are, the free limousine, free wifi on A380, and the extensive menu options both at their Al Mourjan Lounge and on board the aircarft compare to their comppetitor, Emirates. However, I would still choose to fly on Qatar Airways since they are a member of One World Alliance and based on their on board service experienced."

The food and drinks on the flights were excellent, the crew could not do enough for me. I only had a very brief visit to their lounge in Doha, but what I saw was very good, my only gripe was that they used buses to and from the planes on both flights in Doha. Qatar Airways London assured that airbridges would be used, especially as they now had a brand new airport, so it looks as if they haven't been informed about them still using buses or they don't want to tell you. As I am 82 years old I find it difficult walking up and down those stairs carrying two cases. Hopefully on my return flight in September, they will use airbridges , I'll have to wait and see. Except for that minor thing, I would have given them 10/10, but I can only give them a 8/10"

Qatar's pricing is a major draw-card, they were significantly cheaper than Emirates. The trip out of JNB to DOH was great, the plane was not full and a lot of passengers had spare seats around them. Not sure that it would have been as pleasant with a full plane. Having heard so much about the Boeing 787, I was expecting it to be state-of-the-art flying, but I can't say that was the case. The seats are as hard  and very cramped - these seats rate very poorly against the Boeing 777, and the only way I could grab any sleep was by sleeping against the window. The food was really good, and I love the containers they use - much better than any other airline I have flown with recently. Entertainment is great - the range is not quite as extensive as Emirates or BA, but streets ahead of Turkish Airlines. One gripe is that the crew would only serve one drink with dinner, I couldn't have a pre-dinner drink and a glass of wine. Thought that was rather mean. The flight between Doha and Istanbul was also good, despite it being a full flight on a narrow body aircraft. Return flight was great too, my only gripe is that every leg of the journey entailed a bus to get to the terminal building, and another back out. That would be okay if you weren't left in the 38 degree heat. Other than that, I can't fault Qatar."

Qatar Airways provides a good service in economy, all flights were on time and the transit at the new Doha airport was painless. They have to work on their inflight entertainment system though, as it is a rather clumsy and unresponsive design. That was really the only issue, for the rest inflight service was good. Some reviewers complain about the limited legroom and uncomfortable seats on the dreamliner but I found both to be adequate. As long as Qatar Airways offer competitive fares they will be on my shortlist for trips to Asia."

Enjoyable flight on Qatar Airways, friendly staff and good service. A drink not long after departure, drink with the meal and a post dinner drink (including good quality Armagnac) plus drinks on request. Champagne was offered in economy - not the most common offering and a welcome change from other airlines who often only offer red/white wine and beer for economy passengers. Comfortable seats with a good range of English, International, Arabic programmes meant the flight was more than tolerable. Food a little highly salted - offerings were chicken/beef with rice/potatoes, nothing ground breaking but nothing to complain about either. Only negative was that like most Gulf airlines it's lacks character - something I enjoy when flying with flag carriers."

Keeping in mind that Qatar Airways has been voted #1 in the world it is hard to find fault with anything. My only comment would be that over 5 hours is a long way to fly in a narrow body jet. Transiting Doha is now much better with the new terminal. And even better if you have a silver card as you get access to a lounge in Entebbe and Doha. And for most sectors out of Entebbe (Uganda) Qatar offer the best price, which makes them unbeatable really unless you want a direct flight to Western Europe."

What a difference this time! The B787 seats are not as good as A380, but okay for the shorter flight to Doha. The window shades in this 787 aircraft are rubbish, and they do not block out the sun as was promised when Boeing were advertising the benefits of the plane. The A380 was so much better, nice and spacious and seats very comfortable. IFE is not very different to Emirates or Singapore Airlines that I flew last time, don't understand why everyone raves about Emirates because they just have a huge library of ancient, 2nd rate films. Food was good, not the best but certainly good for Economy cabin trip. Cabin staff were great on both flights, better for DOH-BKK where they were chatty and friendly.

The Boeing 787 seats appear good for children and small females but an adult male will be uncomfortable. The first thing to do is relocate the Media box away from the under seat area. Having my one foot out in the isle was not only a safety hazard but not fun to be kicked and bumped into because I could not move my feet if placed under the seat. I was sitting next to a larger man who encroached into my seat space. I believe the seat is about 17"" across. Seat pitch minimal but no different to other airlines. Service was very friendly, top notch. Noticeably better than US airlines. Food was disappointing.  While the airline does offer superb service, I recommend against flying them in coach due to seat restrictions. "

Catering was on demand and staff were warmer this time around and did their job splendidly, although they should chill champagne and white wine properly. The attendant laid out the flat bed on the 772 and provided all passengers with PJ's, a comfy pillow and a duvet. On all flights, the toilets were kept clean, food was served warm, good brewed coffee served and the in flight entertainment was adequate. Great multinational crew which is a plus with this airline. I would highly recommend this airline."

TIF-DOH First class. I told the flight attendant what I wanted to eat from the menu where items required a choice, assuming that the rest of the menu would follow but all I got was I had selected from that section none of the other items came. The lounge in Doha is large and somewhat impersonal but excellent nevertheless. DOH-BKK Business Class, the crew apart seemed disinterested. Some passengers had finished their meal before others had started.  I guess what niggled me not being on the receiving end of top priority as I usually am. All in all OK service and flight. But Qatar normally is above OK and exceptional. I put it down to a bad day for both them and me. "

The seats are very comfortable with plenty of space and storage space. The TV was big and HD. The choice of films, TV, games and music is very good. The food choice and quality was really good.

From Athens to Doha my husbands screen didn't work and only towards the end of flight did the air hostess offer for him to change seats. She kept on forgetting to help and by then he had cut losses and tried to sleep. We also had a 10 hour stopover. All my family who have had long stopovers had been given complimentary hotel rooms. For this reason we decided to book on Qatar. As the time got closer I mailed to ask about this, the staff replies were short, rude and unhelpful. The told me all the places we could pay to stay at, which we had not budgeted for. So we had a horrid stopover at airport. Second time using Qatar and this will be my last. With that said their South African office was friendly and nice."

HAN-BKK in B777-200. BKK-DOH in A380. DOH-CPH in B787. Excellent experience throughout. All flights on time. Staff alert, attentive and productive. Service and drinks world top class. Food amount and quality is significantly slipping but still acceptable. Because QR has recently done a lot of promotional sales, business class cabins are now full or almost full. However, service was still exhibited well and focused. I rate the B777-200 business class seat and cabin comfort high. However, the best seat and cabin among the 3 aircrafts tried was the A380: almost noiseless and with the luxury bar on the upper deck. FA tend not to chat with each other and keep themselves busy making a true effort comforting the pax – they are friendly and talk positively with most passengers. That’s the way! Of all sectors above only the DOH-CPH was in economy, of course a different ballgame with a slimmer hardware and software - but altogether the rating became equally high. Worst on the 787 is the extreme compacted seating which must be among the heaviest packed economy in the world – not much dreaming on that part of the Dreamliner, now I understand the nickname “Nightmare-liner”: If the person in front of you reclines you are forced to do the same unless you close your tray-table! In contrast, the following sector back from CPH-DOH was in the Dreamliner aircraft’s business class which offered a superb odysse, but still a bit below that of QR’s A380. Business class full but staff managed very well, high degree of attention and service. Al Mourjan lounge in DOH clearly 5 star, though too big to my taste. Lots of food in either buffets, a la carte. The bar on 1st floor offered 3 different, prestigious champagnes (I just checked and saw the bottles). From DOH-BKK in A380: faultless, quiet, lots of service and talkative FA’s. I could have all 3 options of hot meals, but limited myself to vegetarian and chicken. Quality of food deteriorates a bit. Slept well. Ground-staff assisted me catching my next flight on a difficult time-constrained connection by a Low Cost Carrier, though actually not QR’s problem. Thanks, QR!"

R Clarke",,16th June 2015,Business,Business Class,MEL-DOH-BAH,June 2015,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,,,3,no,1,"MEL-DOH-BAH. The journey back to Bahrain from Melbourne was an awful experience. Flight QR905, June 6th was delayed 45 mins. Ground staff at the gate were not sure what was going on and it seemed organized chaos as a lot of passengers were complaining quite profusely. There was no specific lane for business class passengers to board,
something that was quite obvious on my trip through Hamad Airport going to Melbourne on QA904 on the 21st May. Problems start on QA905, once in the air on a 14 hr flight you want to relax and have creature comforts. It involves the inflight entertainment system. I started watching a movie once we had taken off after the 45min
delay. A passengers IFE was not working so the chief steward was trying to help fix it but sadly he did not inform others that he was going to shut down the IFE for a reboot. My screen suddenly went off as it did for a number of other passengers. This rebooting was tried 3 times then the chief steward just said we can’t fix the problem. This is unacceptable in my book, no portable DVD players were available like you have on Gulf Air, Singapore Airlines and Silk Air as a back up. The system is very fragile indeed and many headphones were not working or only working in one ear. I had to change out 2 headphones to get to hear proper sounds. The next flight 7th June, Doha - Bahrain on QR1121 was just as bad. 55 minutes delay and gate C-28 was just utter chaos. Appalling organization by Qatar ground staff at this gate who again were not that customer friendly. The special lane for business class passengers was not even open and we were lumped in with everyone else. The next time I travel to Melbourne I shall not be using Qatar."

Had to run miles with inaccurate information on airport departure boards indicating flight was boarding when in fact it was delayed. Seat pitch seemed tight. No hot towels or menu cards, although the menu was shown onscreen through the inflight entertainment system. Meal was tasty enough but small portion sizes.

Our flight Zagreb left on time, arrived Doha early and we left to Dubai just on time too! On our flight to Dubai the boarding was quick and easy. Flight was comfortable and food on board was yummy. The only downside to this was that, for our flight from Doha to Dubai, we weren't given any headsets for the inflight entertainment. I assume this could be due to the short flight duration. "

Check-in chaotic after a big storm in Washington which flooded the airports internal train and tunnel system, so all passengers for all flights put on Dulles' dreaded 'people movers'. Flight had 60 wheelchair passengers comprised mostly of those who think they get through security faster if being pushed around. FAs call these ones the 'miracle passengers' who then gamely run off the plane on arrival to get through immigration and customs. Other airlines that have started charging for wheelchair use without a medical certificate find that requests for wheelchairs drops about 90 percent. Full business cabin. Service and
catering excellent. Made up time en route for late departure and landed in DOH almost on schedule.  "

Check-in excellent at IAD, followed-by the use of the Virgin Clubhouse. Virgin reception staff rather uptight, but the dining area staff was outstanding. All four flight segments were not full, so I had an empty seat next to me at all times. This is a huge benefit, as although the
seat has an outstanding pitch, is wide and very comfortable, it dates back to business class seating of a decade ago, with zero privacy between seats if you are travelling alone. A small bottle of water and a nice Georgio Amani amenity kit was awaiting my arrival, with a blanket, pillow and noise-cancelling headphones. Pyjamas and slippers were given out later on the segments to/from IAD. Staff service was very good on all segments and dine when you want service was good, though cutbacks are very evident in their menus. Of the four flight segments, QR 707 from DOH to IAD on 01 June had excellent crew serving the rear business class cabin where I was. Transit time was short at DOH, but the airport does not function logically, despite its showy architecture. Certainly no match for SIN and HKG. Check-in at CMB was efficient, and I used the UL Serendib Lounge due to my OW Emerald Tier status. Mid-week QR fare was very competitive, and provided very good value for money. Baggage delivery at IAD was much delayed, though probably not QR's fault. Will definitely use them again, especially as they are a OW member airline."

Very claustrophobic, tiny seats, the service took forever. Flight left at 2130, it was nearly 3 hours later that I finally got a drink and something to eat. The meal was cold and when I pressed the call bell to try and get someone to heat my meal, I was ignored. Cannot believe on this evidence they are a 5 star airline. However coming back on QR5, it was like flying a completely different airline - friendly cabin crew, nice food, good service. Maybe it helped that the flight was half empty but what a difference. A330 a much nicer experience than the Dreamliner, wider seats, more legroom and just more comfortable. Doha airport in the afternoon was practically deserted, this is obviously a good time to depart."

The dine anytime service is much appreciated. The seat, especially on the B777, is comfy.
Very good amenity kit from Armani, the best noise cancelling headphones I have experienced on a plane. Entertainment system is good, even tho the choice of movies on the Milan-Doha segment was maybe too limited. What makes QR a 5-star airline is the cabin crew: extremely polite, friendly, smiling, very well groomed. As a Privilege club member, I was recognized by name on both sectors. Hamad International airport business lounge, huge but still crowded, is quite impressive. I do look forward to flying the A350 business product on my way back."

As others have commented, the B787 as fitted by QR is a major problem because of hard, narrow and just plain uncomfortable seats, which really is unacceptable for flights of seven to eight hours. This is such an issue as to overshadow other generally satisfactory aspects. I might fly QR again but not on their 787s."

Qantas lounge in Melbourne is a dark dungeon and not particularly worth the visit. Boarding was pain free although cabin crew were not well versed when it came to assisting parents with two young children. In most cases on all flights I found all cabin crew friendly but unable to take the initiative to offer services. in most cases if you wanted something you had to ask instead of being offered. These were not lazy crew, they worked hard but they were just not polished crew used to premium service. First of the two business class cabins is the better of the cabins as it feels more spacious and open. Seats are lay flat and comfortable. Inflight entertainment is lacking with random titles from the 80's and not much more if you select the Hollywood option. Hamad Intl is great and the lounge is huge and fantastic. No one explains the options available to you and your left wondering what's on offer. Great flights and great lounges in Doha and London. Food is exceptional bit staff need more training though not because they disgruntled. One incident did concern me though. The A380 has a inflight bar which on one flight was serving up excessive amounts of alcohol to two passengers who subsequently were almost restrained in their seats by crew. Cabin crew really should have stopped serving the two passengers hours before. The only major issue on an otherwise great trip. "

B Johnson",,13th June 2015,Business,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,"For someone who has become used to the standard European business class long haul (BA/Lufthansa etc), these middle eastern airlines are quite a revelation.  Much like the Cathay Pacific's of the worlds, these guys put the staid overpriced tiredness of the European airlines in perspective.  Business class on Qatar is, for example,
certainly more than the equivalence of BA's first class. And at significant cost reductions. Part of it is the staff, you just don't get the level of service orientation on European airlines like BA and Lufthansa.  Its like there is no motivation to go beyond the standard, drummed in training they've done a hundred times. You know those adverts where you see the service crew gently put a blanket on a sleeping guest?  I had assumed that was rubbish, it had never happened to me.  Well it did with Qatar!  One of the staff even made a personal plan to get an out of stock duty free item to me!  Unreal stuff.  Or maybe this is how it should be?  And long  may it last, I hope these guys continue to put pressure on the old hens of the sky like BA and Lufthansa - the competition can only be good for the passengers.  Now if the transit times weren't there these guys would be the only ones I'd fly."

W Woon",,7th June 2015,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,,5,yes,7,"4 flight sectors altogether: SIN-DOH-LHR on 5 May CDG-DOH-SIN on 21/22 May. SIN-DOH-SIN were on 787 DOH-LHR and CDG-DOH were on A380. A journey of contrasts between the excellent A380 and nightmare 787 which led to an average rating. For all 4 flights the in-flight entertainment were new advanced and top-notch though slightly laggy. USB ports were available for charging of equipment. The food was decent though the main meal servings were small. For snacks what they called sandwiches were actually (very oily) wraps with a small slice of cake. Service was also average (not as friendly as I'd expect though I must pity them because they sometimes had to deal with a tough crowd of fliers) and can be inconsistent across flights and even within a flight. For instance different kinds of snacks served sometimes a paper menu is used while other times it isn't. That said I appreciate the free amenity kit for the red-eye flights. The booking website was also a pain to use sometimes with outdated information or links that failed to work. New Doha airport which serves as QR's hub - looks new but unfortunately isn't customer-oriented. Now to the specific flight sectors / planes. The A380 is newer and very spacious with comfortable seat pitch and seat width. I will definitely fly their A380 again. The 787 ""Dreamliner however belies its ""dream"" qualities: I did not feel the narrower seat width until I had a man next to me poke his elbows into my ribs for hours while using a laptop on the DOH-SIN leg. I never felt this uncomfortable on a long-haul flight before. For the DOH-LHR leg I was ""upgraded"" to upper deck economy class due to a full flight and as I was a (rival) BA Avios member. Such seats are unavailable for normal reservation except for QR FFP members. That said I was a little unhappy with being ""upgraded"" to a seat without a window which I had originally reserved and requested. Overall I might fly QR again if the price and timing is right for in general they have performed above-average. Potential deterrent factors would include their 787 their buggy website and Doha airport (woe betide anyone with a long layover)."

Will keep this simple and say the 4 flights we had with Qatar Airways last week were the best 4 I've had or at least right near the very top (the first one LHR-DOH was unquestionably our best). All 4 flights left on time on the 2 long ones we got constant service on drinks and as well as the meal got 3 other food portions all of which were very nice. On the short 45 mins flight from Doha to Dubai we got a nice sandwich and cake with drinks was very satisfactory and wouldn't have wanted more. The service from the staff was excellent not just on the plane but at the airport all of them were very polite. The inflight entertainment was brilliant with a huge choice of recent releases TV shows etc. The toilets were clean and well kept. The only bug bear would probably be the box below the window seat which limits legroom I had no problem with it but I would imagine that some people might. Overall I enjoyed all the flights and would opt to choose them again next time.

Flights between DOH - CPT and return on new 787's I found the 787 noisy and not as comfortable as the A380 both flights on time again pretty good service from nice crews although food not that good.

The new Business Class Lounge in Noi Bai T2 is new friendly and bright and provides an excellent view of lanes and planes. Several hot dishes presented I preferred the marinated fried fish and the beef stew. New cozy spacious shower rooms offered. A couple of small wild birds made the visit memorable and pleasurable they seem to have not only been bewildered into the airport but obviously settled there as I saw also 1-2 birds there a 2 months earlier. Business Class almost fully lie flat. Service on board top notch though food options limited on this short sector. They ran out of prawn salad when they came to my seat and option was only a hot snack plate nothing top brawl about. I could have as many as I wanted however. Denied my so much wanted cheese plate as this is not offered for short sectors (likewise no amenity kit). FA's were in a sparkling mood lifting the whole thing. Drink service quick and fairly frequent. Many drink options inc. three different champagnes and pre-take-off drinks offered. Economy class on way back was also about as good as it gets. Champagne provided on request. Staff in Economy are quite impersonal but do the job. In Bangkok QR uses Thai Airways lounges which are good but somehow I prefer the new Business Class lounge in Hanoi operated by NASCO. None of them have sparkling wine and Hanoi lounge offers only local wine.

Just did Perth to Doha in business on a 777 and then Doha to Paris economy on the 380 and return the same way. All trips on time. We had a look at business class on the 380 but prefer the layout on the 777. Economy upstairs on the 380 was fine for the shorter journey. What was excellent was the service. Consistently very high standard from FA's. As Qantas gold members we chose Qatar over Emirates because there was several thousand dollars difference in cost for our package and Qatar still gave us One World benefits. Would not hesitate to choose them again. We used Qantas lounge in Perth which is not bad Air France premium lounge at CDG which has all the amenities of the QF lounge at Karratha and the Qatar lounge it Doha which is simply superb.

Rohnny Bergers",,20th May 2015,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,Flight MXP to BKK in November 2014. Both flights on schedule. The A330 from MXP to DOH was rather old and very few leg space. The B777 from DOH to BKK was rather ok but still I had the feeling that they reduced in this aircraft as well the leg space. Honestly I can't complain because I paid a very low rate. On the MXP-DOH flight staff made a mess with the meal requests I made during my booking. While serving food they told me the low fat meal wasn't available and they served me the normal meal. After 40 minutes an other hostess passed by to serve me the low fat meal. On the DOH-BKK flight everything was ok.

D Lee",,20th May 2015,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,Economy SIN-DOH-ATH 9 May and VIE-DOH-SIN 16 May. Boarding at Singapore on time and flight departed slightly behind schedule. The seats on the B787 were a bit cramped and not the most comfortable. Entertainment system was good and meal service was prompt. Very good snack sandwiches and main meals. Transfer at Doha was seamless - upon disembarking I could clear the transit security within 10 minutes. Flight to Athens on an older A330-300 entertainment system a bit dated food was good and service was ok. Seat was very good though. Departed Doha behind schedule and arrived in Athens around 10 minutes late but bags were on the belt within 20 minutes of disembarking the aircraft. Return from Vienna was good - check-in was fast and boarding took around 20 minutes although it was a bit disorganised. Vienna-Doha flight was operated by the B787 once again seats and entertainment was ok. The veg meal I got on this flight was pretty good and crew were very professional. Had the privilege to fly on the A350 from Doha to Singapore and the aircraft was a step up from the B787. Seats had more pitch/width and the earphone and USB ports are now integrated into the screen the entertainment system worked perfectly. Flight on this sector was not full but the service was the best of the lot. Cabin crew went around on several drink and snack services and the main breakfast meal on this sector was good. Arrival in Singapore on time and bags were on the belt within 20 minutes. It was a good experience with Qatar Airways and I look forward to flying more of the A350 in future.

G Palmer",,18th May 2015,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,"Flew LHR to BKK and back a few weeks ago final destination Siem Reap in Cambodia. Picked my flights based on trying out the A380 for one leg and then other three sectors on the 777-300ER which I'd read reviews were the most comfortable. Funnily enough found the A380 segment the most enjoyable and comfortable - both hard and soft product just seemed a little bit more ""all there"" and I could swear there was more legroom in the A380 than on the 777 despite the official figures saying otherwise - Maybe seat thickness and how it's sculptured? Food is average but edible - Oh and there's no timing advantage to pre-ordering a special meal it gets loaded in the trolley and served alongside everybody else's. On the way back journey originated in Siem Reap in Cambodia on Bangkok Airways - Because they code share w QR I managed to get my luggage checked through to LHR even got boarding passes issued all the way too!"

James Choochot",,16th May 2015,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,MAN to BKK economy via Doha. Both legs delayed by at least an hour though boarding on-time. Was worried about connection at Doha but assured nothing to worry about as we had made up the lost hour. At Doha circled for over 30 mins before landing. Airport (state of the art new Hamad hub airport) in chaos due to smog. Face masks required all though airport! I have never experienced this in my life time. In-flight entertainment system excellent as are food and drinks services. This is an airline where staff appear happy in their jobs. On both legs one cooked meal (delicious) then one snack ( a wrap or a pasty) handed out. During flight soft drinks and snacks available. Good choice of free alcoholic drinks too including champagne by request. I don't usually travel economy class for long haul flights but it is well worth it with Qatar.

K Seweryn",,16th May 2015,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,NRT-WAW end of March and WAW-NRT week later. Family with small (5 and 7) children. 1 hour late departure to Warsaw rest on time. Very good seat on NRT-DOH (and DOH-NRT) flight (772) really no problem with space for big person (185cm/110kg). On DOH-WAW much smaller (320)  but still OK for 6 hours. From Warsaw IFE wasn't working at all for one seat (have to reseat) and also was very difficult to use it on another. Overhead lights wasn't working at all for 3 seats. Small amenity kit even in economy! Food good and plenty children food in really nice box. Cabin crew not attentive but also not bad. Very recommended (especially for the price that I've paid).

D Leston",,12th May 2015,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,,,4,yes,8,LHR-DOH-BKK-DOH-LHR. It's been a few years since I last flew QR so I was interested in seeing whether they'd kept their standards as high as I remembered. Largely I wasn't disappointed and having flown on 777/A330/A340/A380 I got to try out most of their LH types. Cabin crew are still as good aircraft interiors are still pristine (especially on the A380 although understandable as only 6 months old). Hamad International is a great improvement on the old Doha airport for transit. If I were to criticise anything it would be the food. This definitely seems to have deteriorated a bit. Two meals were absolutely inedible which was really surprising.

M LaPrairie",,11th May 2015,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,DOH-DFW business class on QR733 using 777-300 (changed equipment from 777-200). According to Wikipedia the 19th longest scheduled flight in the world (16h5m). Had seat 1A with no one beside me. Usual obliging service on board from a very courteous and professional crew. Have just got onto an American Airlines flight in first where I basically had my dinner tossed at me - what a difference from QR! Flight left DOH about an hour late due to an equipment change. Nice seat good food. I have no complaints about QR. For this trip I joined their mileage program. Before I was collecting miles on QR flights using my BA account but not getting much in terms of bonus miles or progress toward higher tier status. Decided to switch over to QR's program as I have a lot of travel with QR coming up.

Harold Bush",,11th May 2015,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,yes,6,A day before my return to LHR from BKK I received an email from Qatar offering me a good deal for an upgrade to Business Class which I took up. They were meant to start check-in process at BKK airport at 5 pm but did not do so till 5.20. Check in staff was excellent and efficient. I was offered a drink after boarding but not a hot or cold towel. The person next to me was offered both. I opted for a middle seat in order to have aisle access; configuration of 777 is 2-2-2. The seats are indeed very comfortable but there is not much privacy. I was rather disappointed again with the food. I was expecting a lot more. It was all nicely presented and the FAs do go out of their way to make one's journey enjoyable but I do not think the food was as good as people claim and I have had much better food on Cathay and BA in Business. The food from Doha to LHR was even less interesting. And on this leg on an A340-600 the seat was much smaller and with even less privacy. The person next to me almost damaged my glasses which I had put on the little shared area between the seats. The business lounge at Doha is superb but again the food was a let down. My option salmon was not available from the a la carte menu. I had a lamb which was hard and very salty. The buffet stuff looked like something from my local Waitrose and was simple. The snack area was far more interesting. They prepare whatever you want. Lovely. There are many areas in the lounge including a large business room next to which there is an area hardly anyone uses. The so-called 'quiet area' was anything but quiet: people snoring breaking winds pulling trolleys talking etc. The seats are extremely uncomfortable and in no way one can have a good nap there. I do not understand why they cannot put stuff like in the BA's cabanas at T5 with blankets. My verdict is that Qatar Business is good but definitely not well above that of Cathay or BA as people claim.

A Praszek",,11th May 2015,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,3,no,4,Recently flew LHR-AUH-LHR with a stopover in Doha. It wasn't my first time that I used QA but I sincerely hoped that their service will improve. I was wrong! Ground staff during the check-in at LHR was not nice. People you need to start smiling! Airbus A340 was spacious so there were no problems with a legroom. Inflight entertainment was ok. Cabin crew was inattentive sometimes not polite. I have asked for a glass of water before they started serving the meal but didn't get any Crew member looked unsatisfied when I interrupted her with a glass of water request. I also had to remind them about the bland meal that I've pre-ordered. Return flight from Abu Dhabi to Doha had 1 hour delay. It was a miracle that I've managed to catch a LHR flight which also arrived in London with a 20-minute delay. Despite their cheap fares I'm not going to fly with Qatar Airways anymore. I'll better pay more for a flight with a competitor airline.

R Mehta",,30th April 2015,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,Recently flew from LHR to AUH via DOH. First leg was supposed to be an A380 which I specifically booked changed to a 777 which was annoying but nonetheless very comfortable. A comfortable 3-3-3 configuration on 777 unlike other Gulf carriers which opt for a cramped 3-4-3. Transit at Hamad international was very simple a very clean and not too large airport. Lots of food given and even champagne served in economy! A320 DOH-AUH and back decent snack provided good for a short-haul. Again easy transit and onto a very new A330 back to LHR service fantastic but seats were noticeably smaller in width compared to 777 but a very new IFE. On departing LHR I arrived late at the airport but the Qatar ground staff were very reassuring and helpful making sure I caught the flight.

H Mythenmetz",,28th April 2015,,Business Class,,,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,,3,no,4,At the end of March and again the beginning of April we travelled from TXL to DOH in an A330-200 business class. The total impression of the interior was not positive but rather rundown. The cabin staff on the other hand â€“ were very polite and helpful making the flight really agreeable. The electronic seat adjustment device of a great number of seats did not really work so you had to put up with some awkward seating positions. The most unusual sight was a passenger nearly lying flat on the seat during landing after several staff tried in vain to put the seat in an upright position. Another highlight were the attempts of several cabin staff members to unlock dining tables with spoons. In the end they succeeded. The meals did not really offer inflight dining experience it was more business as usual - nothing worth mentioning. On the whole we had the impression that for this unimportant route written off aircraft's are used whose cabin maintenance leaves a lot to be desired. On our return flight there were no technical problems worth mentioning except that now the cabin crew members were more interested in chatting with each other than serving meals and drinks.

Ali Soufan",,27th April 2015,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,,,4,no,4,LHR-DXB via DOH. Both legs of the flights were operated by an aged A340-600. I think Qatar should start thinking of not sending these aircraft's to such long haul routes. Aircraft was very tired from inside and the leg room was awful - so tight. Your flight would be ruined if the person in front reclines their seat as there will no room for you to move or watch. Food was of a very low standard. Coming back again aircraft was an A330-200/300 leg. Frankly speaking the leg room was much better on this aircraft however again old and tired from inside with cabin crew not being attentive to passengers.

Harold Bush",,27th April 2015,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,LHR-DOH-BKK in economy all the way on their brand new A380. Two great trips. Only problem is that the food is terrible and portions extremely small. Why do they bother? Best take your own. I had a rubbery chicken which tasted like something else. Space in economy seats on the A380 is extremely generous equivalent to BA WT+. Very impressive. Connection at Doha was very easy: off the plane and straight into departure area for connecting passengers no security check there. I am a BA Gold card EC so am allowed to use First check in First lounges and priority boarding. However Qatar is so fussy about its premium passengers I was not allowed to board via priority First class boarding even though I was in small economy cabin at the back of the upper deck where First and Business are located. I had to board and disembark via usual channels via lower cabin which means if you are in economy in the upper deck you will be last to disembark. Cosy small cabin though. Is this in breach of Oneworld rules regarding perks of being Emerald? The word that first came to my mind is segregation. They take incredible measures to protect their premium passengers from any contact with the rest of us ordinary mortals. I have never seen anything like this in my many years of continuos travelling in First Business and economy. Staff are professional. I had access to First class lounge at Doha which is gigantic nice but mayhem at peak hours. Amazing service though. The good thing about it is that there are several areas one could choose from. I went for the one adjacent to the business centre which was very quiet indeed. Both flight were not full. LHR to DOH was almost empty. A good experience I am happy to repeat especially when the price for tickets was one of the best I have seen in years to get from LHR to BKK.

Nice ambience and facilities though it is already started showing its age. Toilets were not clean enough. I think QR has a good investment in hardware but its software - i.e. the crew are not as attentive as other airlines that I've travelled on before. eCheck in at ZRH was a breeze attentive ground staff by SWISSPORT. Service started from pre-meal drinks meal snack another round of pre-landing pre-pour drink which was good enough for a 5-hour flight the IFE was good but not user-friendly as you need to key in the movie number for the specific movie.

What was supposed to be a pleasant and enjoyable flight actually has been a nightmare from the beginning to the end. Check-in at Sharjah was chaotic  a ground staff member belonging to Air Arabia opened the counter 30 minutes late and were needing 15 to 20 minutes to treat every passenger even in the priority lane. My request for an emergency exit for a wider pitch was ignored. Had to ask 3 times for the Business Class lounge invitation card and the female agent even forgot to give my passport to me after (finally) printing my tickets. Police controls were crowded the time spent at the VIP lounge was the only enjoyable moment. QR Chef d'Escale was very friendly and helpful. No special welcome for Privilege club old A320 aircraft snack served was awful and nothing other than water available. Transit time at Doha was the worst: despite QR sales office promise of hotel accommodation being provided for more than an 8 hour transit I discovered that passengers coming from/going to Sharjah were excluded of this courtesy. I had to stay overnight in the Oryx Lounge which was crowded. No earplugs nor eye mask available. At least showers were very clean and comfortable. Food offer was ridiculous coffee machine was not working. DOH-NBO morning flight was miserable: old tired A320 no IFE for a 5 hours flight seats cramped no special welcome for Privilege Club and no geovision. The same can be said about the return flight with the same issue at Doha regarding transit. My last time with Qatar Airways.

The only criticism is that the films/music etc is a little outdated and the films are quite old.

In general very good service friendly staff and transit in DOH without any problem. I would recommend QR except for this seat problem on the B777.

Certainly spacious but does not feel as opulent as Emirates A380. Second leg was an A340 which was fine. Service really wasn't great. Whilst staff are smiley it does feel very forced now and I can see the change over the last few years. Food again was average. Whilst not directly related to Qatar - The New Hamad Airport has a lack of signage and direction and the lack of air bridges and speed of connections is appalling for what is supposed to be a new state of the art airport. On the way back Qatar had a sand storm the terminal building was filled with sand and people were really suffering. Whilst I understand this is an act of nature I would like to think if you operate in a region that has extreme weather conditions then you accommodate accordingly.

M Azam",,10th April 2015,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,,5,no,5,LHR-DOH-HKT 19/3/2015. First leg was the ageing A340 which I must add was a superb aircraft very comfortable. Second leg was a A330-300 not so great seats felt worn out. Service wise I have found having travelled with Qatar that it would appear they put their 'best' staff on the Heathrow route and other routes such as Phuket tend to get staff with lower ability. Overall having been a loyal customer of Qatar over the years I am not sure I will be in the future. I agree with other comments that Qatar are riding on past reputations. Food is average at best. Inflight service is now lip service and crew tend to walk past whilst offering teas and coffees without actually making eye contact. And entering and leaving the aircraft they might as well have no one on the doors. They did however provide bassinets for my kids (although on the Phuket flight crew never assembled it correctly). Whilst not directly related to Qatar - The New Hamad Airport is a joke lack of signage and direction and the lack of air bridges and speed of connections is appalling for what is supposed to be a new state of the art airport.

What a nice experience-even quieter than the giant A380 this is a lovely plane and very nice interior that whilst is very similar to the 787 is another level up in terms of classiness-next flight was on a 787 from Doha-Singapore. Looking forward to our return journey on the A350. Also worth noting that routing FRA-SIN was so much cheaper than LHR-SIN - but more hassle to get a connecting BA flight from LhR to FRA but for the 3 of us it saved several thousand pounds!

A Coldrey",,6th April 2015,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,,2,no,1,I will never fly Qatar Airways again flying Manchester-Doha-Johannesburg and return. Outbound flight good friendly check in assistant who allocated me an emergency exit seat with extra leg room because of my disability. Worst problem was the 7 hour wait in Doha which we were aware of. However on the return flight unfriendly and unwilling to assist at check in even though I am registered on their site as disabled and therefore not able to check in online no assistance given. We were given our tickets and thankfully I checked our connection from Doha to Manchester and it had been changed and we were not informed. This resulted in a six hour wait in Doha instead of an hour and half. No assistance given on either leg of journey to allocate me extra legroom and only when we were about to board the flight from Doha to Manchester we then discovered we were in separate rows but I had been allocated a middle seat which with my disability makes it worse. We managed to change seats on the airplane thanks to a helpful fellow traveler but with no assistance from the airline crew. Also found the seats very uncomfortable and had a sore back for days after returning home. Never again!

T Fosgate",,30th March 2015,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,,3,no,3,"There are two reasons why I would never fly with Qatar airways again: 1) Their apparent policy regarding delayed flights. I spent 13 hours at Kathmandu airport this weekend waiting for a flight back to London via Doha. Weather may be beyond their control but how they respond to it is not. They were the last of the airlines to be able to land and filled the first flights in with passengers on later scheduled flights in priority to ourselves who had waited the longest. Consequently our 12.30pm flight finally got away at 9.30pm when they appeared to find an extra plane under the sofa . Not a great disaster in the scheme of things but if I have a choice of an airline that makes an attempt to get those who have waited the longest away first then I will take it. 2) Comfort: The seats appear to be ergonomically designed for maximum discomfort. I am a 5ft 5"" guy who weights 8 stone and I had problems I can't imagine what it must be like if you are taller and wider. After about 2 hours in to a 7 hours flight I was really struggling. That said I can't fault the service-the cabin crew were efficient friendly and attentive. Shame then about 1 and 2."

Lounge in Singapore was better than I expected after reading reviews small selection of hot and cold food and small drinks selection but it was cool and fairly quiet. Good priority boarding at Singapore and bus transfer at Doha - separate bus exclusively for business class. On both legs we were welcomed on board by name and shown to our seats and given pre takeoff drink and the offer of a newspaper and amenity bag provided. Pyjamas were only provided on the Singapore-Doha leg. At all times we were referred to by name and after takeoff CSD introduced themselves staff checked that we knew how all the controls worked on the seat and IFE I witnessed them showing great patience helping an elderly gentleman get to grips with the IFE. We were provided with a wine and food menu and it was explained that we could dine as and when we wanted. The food and wine selection was very good and the food was presented very well. The cabin crew were continuously walking the cabin quietly offering service when it was required. Found the seat very comfortable in all positions and managed to sleep for around 4-5 hours on each leg. The toilets were spacious and were kept in a spotless condition Our first experience of Qatar and I can guarantee that it won't be our last. A world apart from our outward trip on BA. Totally recommend Qatar Airways.

Anders Pedersen",,30th March 2015,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,Flew HAN-BKK-DOH-DWC (Dubai “World) and return to Hanoi in March 2015 in economy (HAN-BKK-HAN on B777-3) business (BKK-DOH on A380 and DOH-BKK on B777) and first (DOH-DWC-DOH on A320) respectively. Fantastic airline in all classes. Except for “First” within middle East which is not “real” First on a A320 as the seats are only typical old style bz/class seats. But as for the A380 the bz class gives a sublime experience almost to perfection. The bar onboard offers intelligently other brands of drinks as those on the menu card served while seated. I like the herring bone seat layout and found the trip cozy and staff caring. Ate at demand. Sophisticated drink lists with many expensive items offered like several wines one normally does not access easily. As usual poor on beer options. Only small portions of food offered as compared to earlier business class experiences with QR. Staff alert and professional and truly caring. A great experience. All flights on time except one which caused a missing connection however QR instantly rebooked to my satisfaction and eventually I arrived on time to final destinations. They have a tendency to close servicing passengers on board far too early before landing (approx. 40 minutes) which is disappointing and unnecessary annoying.

K Coutinho",,28th March 2015,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,9,Flew LHR-DOH on the A380 Lounge access at LHR was great - really personalised service. Felt like being in a swanky hotel rather than a lounge. On-board the seats were fine not as nice as Emirates but for sure a comfy space. Great food and beverage service little tip they leave the Krug at the bar worth the walk over! IFE was a bit skippy. DOH-RHY on 787 they used Business but rebrand it as first Short trip so fine - not a major fan of the 787. The lounge in Riyadh is abysmal but it's shared. Spent time in duty free to avoid this lounge. Doha terminal nice easy to have a long layover especially here with the family rooms available for a sleep and Krug on Tap. Don't recommend the 45 min transfer the terminal is big and there is no help on connections to get you there on time - at least they let business out as priority so I had a chance and the run woke me up a little bit. DOH-LHR was on the Business One A319 aircraft. Comfortable Seats IFE didn't work properly (kept skipping again but more frequently) but as they handed out PJ's it encouraged everyone to go to sleep. Service on both legs excellent.

Solomon Roma",,28th March 2015,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,7,Qatar Airways has been a long time favourite as the service is extremely good. On the flight QR564 from Doha to Delhi on 19 March I had very severe earache and I must say that the chief steward really went the extra mile providing me with a hot honey and lemon drink - mush appreciated and really unexpected for an economy class passenger! However the boarding at Delhi on 8th March was a terrible experience - standing in 5 queues for an hour and a half at dawn is not funny especially for a senior citizen. Also there was no in-flight entertainment on the flight from Doha to Nairobi nor on the one from Dar es Salaam to Doha. Plus the meal served on the Doha Delhi flight was really substandard - some kind of chicken korma!

S Kalter",,28th March 2015,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,Nice cabin on newish 777 Dreamliners PHL-Doha-Colombo. Improved legroom in coach good entertainment and food. Cabin crew well above par. One small complaint: The free Doha city tour (layover of five hrs) a great idea and heavily hyped on their site and inflight magazine can only accommodate twenty people at a time and I believe only goes out every two hours. It's a joke as thousands are connecting through at any given time. (if you haven't guessed we were bumped and somewhat casually by the ground staff in Doha who were more interested in returning to their chat than apologizing or explaining the situation).

Younas Safyana",,23rd March 2015,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,9,Travelled over the Christmas period 24/12/14 to 12/1/15 to Singapore Changi. Was hesitant after having read some of the reviews. It had been a couple of years since I had travelled with them last. Was traveling with family so 3 adults and 3 children aged 6 2 and 1. Overall experience was excellent and would travel with them again. The planes were fairly new. Plus points-Qatar staff at all airports from Manchester to return from Changi were great with children which was our biggest worry. Also were very helpful during all flights. Food and drink were served frequently through all flights. Only some minor negatives the entertainment for children was very basic - checked prior to flight and a lot of the programmes that had been mentioned were not available on flight which was disappointing. Also pre-ordered my mothers food who eats Asian non veg food but not beef. Requested the Hindu non- veg meal thinking they will most likely serve Chicken or Lamb for this request but to my mothers disappointment they served prawns (very lovely indeed from my point of view) so if anyone like my mother you may have to request specifically what you want prior as a special request. Would travel with them again.

A Arman",,20th March 2015,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,4,no,7,Trip was Stockholm to Dubai via Doha (Economy class). Flow with the new 787 Dreamliner and as many have written here the seats are quite bad. Really disappointing since I had higher expectations on Qatar Airways. The seats are small legroom is tight and the IFE-box takes up to much space. The entertainment-system is good food and service is also good. Also flew with their A330 which is more comfortable but the entertainment system is really old now. Their best airplanes are without doubt the Boeing 777 which is both comfortable and modern. That's the plane I recommend if you travel with Qatar Airways. But for me I will choose another carrier next time.

Service comfort and food all several grades better than BA as well. Well worth the extra 6 hours journey time and change in Doha for the better comfort and service alone. Change at Doha with 2 hour window was easy and actually broke the journey nicely. Will do again.

All the airlines use it but it is more of a cupboard behind a restaurant. The flight to Doha is on an A321 and is fine. Its not lie flat or anything but its a very short flight. On the return leg we flew on the new A380 from Doha to London. That was a horrible experience and I will avoid this aircraft like the plague. The service is terrible you have to wait ages for anyone to attend to you. I think its because there are too many people. Stick with the 777 if you can. The IFE keeps hanging or the controls fail. I gave up after the 3rd attempt and went and sat in the bar with my wife which is quite pleasant.

We flew on the A340-600 which is quite old and is not lie flat but its decent enough. The lounge in Doha is horrible especially compared to the old one. Its huge impersonal and it feels like most of the airport is in there with you rather than being a quiet sanctuary. More like a school canteen than a business lounge. The flight to Ahmedabad is on an A321 and is fine. Its not lie flat or anything but its a very short flight.

P Herrmann",,17th March 2015,,Business Class,,,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,,5,no,5,"I flew BRU-DOH-DXB and back. Even though the leg DOH-DXB is rated as first class I sub-summarize it as a business class trip because the cabin product is the same. The cabin and the seat are very comfortable nothing to complain. But the service level in general is very low. Starting by the performance of the cabin crew in business class: very hectic not really attentive. They don't use trolleys in business class they serve every guest individually from the galley. This leads to a very hectic atmosphere in the cabin because the crew has to walk a lot. They miss having any grace whilst serving it seems the invention of a service tray has been totally ignored. They bring your plate with bare hands from the galley when they realised that they forgot a spoon and knife they came back holding the spoon in one hand and the knife in the other instead of putting in on a tray and serving it nicely. On the short trip from Doha to Dubai this one-after-another type of service lead to the fact that the last business class row was served only 5 minutes prior to the start of the descent so the poor people could not even finish their meal. But the worst I had to experience was the check-in in Dubai: there was one counter for first and business class passengers and one counter for status members. Both lines totally overcrowded and the check-in procedure went on really slow. After waiting for more than 30 min. some of the first class passengers tried to move to the so called ""help desk"" to ask for check-in there. Suddenly a Qatar airways representative appeared and yelled at them they should go back to their line. I waited more than 50 minutes until I could check- in. The ""first-class"" lounge of Qatar airways is very small and old and was totally overcrowded. Not the way I want to be treated as a first or business class passenger. I think they have to do first a lot of improvement in their service level until they can compete with airlines such as Singapore Airlines."

Early check in at Heathrow and returning at Kathmandu meant we had extra leg room seats on all sectors there and back. Drinks service was wonderful and you can have what you want I was allowed to have champagne with my dinner. The food choice was lovely and tasty. The staff could not do enough for the passengers I have to say I would recommend and definitely fly with Qatar again. If I had any advice I would say they needed another set of toilets on the planes and I found the seats a little tight although I am a large man and I had extra legroom so it did not matter.

Good entertainment system high resolution screen but slow response in the touch and a lack of music and TV-series. The seat config is not good however the leg-room is a bit disappointing. Otherwise the Dreamliner is a nice airplane. On the way back it was with the A330 which is getting old and they should really change the entertainment system onboard. It didn't even work so the flight back was quite boring. Had a short flight with their B777 also from Doha to Dubai which is probably the best airplane Qatar has got right now. More legroom good entertainment system and so on.

J Fairclough",,17th March 2015,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,7,BCN to KUL via DOH. All flights on A-330 200 . The seatmaps for this type of plane are a little misleading. They all show the 4 rows of Biz Class in one large block but the reality is rows 1-3 are in the forward cabin and strangely row 4 only is on its own in a very small section between the Galley and Econ section. My wife and I were seated in seats 4 J+K. It does feel pretty private but of course you are more prone to any noise from kids etc behind in Econ. I guess you pays your money and takes your choice! Food copious and excellent quality on all flights but they can be a bit slow in refilling wine glasses. Even these refurbished A330's are beginning to show their age and frankly the seats are rather lumpy and not all that comfortable even when fully flat. Whilst the boarding at both KL and Barcelona was fine I have to say I was disappointed with that at Doha. 3 out of the 4 flights to or from there were from outlying stands  not jetways. I really find it hard to see how with a brand new airport that trumpets itself as one of the world's best that so many flights involve a long trek followed by being herded onto a bus and having to climb steep steps to board . That sort of thing may have been OK on a charter flight to Majorca from Luton in the '80s but really does not cut the mustard in 2015 on a Business class ticket on a supposedly 5* airline! But overall for the price it is a good product.

Two days before the flight plane was swapped to an A330 with ski slope beds. This is the third time I have had an aircraft substitution to an inferior product with Qatar. Until they can standardise their Business Class product to that of their 787's/A380's I would not recommend them as what product you receive on the day you fly seems a total lottery. If a flat bed and sleep is a priority for you avoid.

These seats are a total disaster with a major design flaw. For sitting and lounging they are OK. When going flat however the footrest goes DOWN despite plenty of space and the midsection goes up. This gets you in a totally unnatural position. Their product on 380 and 777 is better but avoid the 330 at any cost. Just buy and economy seat or fly another airline who better understood the needs of BC travellers.

D Singer",,9th March 2015,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,5,yes,8,LHR-DOH-DXB and back. On London to Doha QF seems to use a mix of aircraft for their many daily flights I experienced the A340-300 both there and back. The aircraft is starting to show its age the seats are uncomfortable and the picture / sound quality on the video on demand sets poor compared to what you get on more modern aircraft these days. However the legroom seemed generous compared to BA Virgin et al. Service was good though on the way back they switched on the lights on a night flight while still over Romania so a good two and a half hours from Heathrow to serve breakfast. Doha's new Hamed International Airport is brand new and a pleasant place to transit through and from Doha to Dubai Qatar used a Dreamliner for what's only a 45 min flight. Despite small issues here and there I'd definitely take them again. They were the cheapest on the route and the experience is still better than what you get on most European (let alone N American) carriers long haul. QF and the other Middle Eastern airlines also haven't introduced the practice of making you pay to choose your seat and if you use the app you can change it as many times as you want (in my case I managed to get a free seat next to me on each stretch) pre check in.

The flight was virtually empty so I just got up and opened up all the blinds that the cabin crew had shut so that I could see out and enjoy the spectacular views of Mt Ararat amongst other things. I too wondered why on earth the cabin staff were making us think we were flying at night and I found it very irritating sufficiently so that I would hesitate to fly this airline again notably as neither the seat comfort not the staff service nor the food nor the inflight entertainment were particularly noteworthy.

Dubai-Doha airbus 330 once again great legroom and service. After the ""spacious"" seating on the short flights the seating felt even more cramped on the longer flight between Doha and Copenhagen.

M LaPrairie",,4th March 2015,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,7,QR1360 JNB-DOH. Seat 4A. After an on-time departure from JNB the bell went off to signal to the cabin crew that they could leave their jump seats to start their work in the cabin. Several passengers in the business class cabin took this as an indication that they could leave their seats even though the seat belt sign was still illuminated. A woman in the row ahead of me got up to use the lavatory. I told her that the seat belt sign was still on so she returned to her seat. Another passenger from row 1 started making his way down the aisle to the lavatory so the woman in front of me said “why don't you tell him”. So I also told him that the seat belt sign was still on and he returned to his seat. When the sign was eventually turned off about ten minutes later the woman in front of me while going to the lavatory stopped at my seat and said “do I have your permission to go to the washroom?” Honestly the crew should be paying more attention not leaving it to passengers to tell other passengers when it is safe to move around the cabin. A tense atmosphere on board could and should have been avoided by the crew doing their job which lets not forget is first and foremost about safety not service.

The connection at Doha was very tight at 45 mins but I assumed that Qatar had it sorted for a quick transit. QR 002 arrived in Doha 10 minutes behind schedule so not an ideal start. It took ground staff almost 15 mins to get the first passengers off. Absolutely no help from ground personnel to fast track to connection. Despite dashing through security and arriving at the gate I was refused boarding and told that the plane had left. I know for a fact that this flight arrives in Phuket most days almost an hour ahead of schedule so why not wait for the dozen affected passengers. I booked my ticket direct with Qatar so would have expected them to assist me to make a tight connection that they sold me.

First leg to Doha on A330-200 not fully booked I had aisle seat plenty of room for my legs (I'm six foot). My entertainment system froze halfway through the film I was watching so I ended up watching the screen on the next (empty) seat. Shiny screens so your reflection dominates a lot of what you watch. Food reasonable service seemed a little slow but overall a good first leg of the trip. There's only a 45 minute layover in Doha but they are well geared up for this and no trouble with missing luggage despite the gates being at opposite ends of the airport. Second leg to Melbourne on a 777-300ER almost full seats nowhere near as comfortable far less leg room. Better entertainment system than the Airbus matt screen so no reflection problems. Food probably slightly better but again seems to be a slow process. Overall however I arrived in Melbourne feeling fit and refreshed and would definitely take the same route again. Here's hoping for Airbus on the return journey.

And if you are above 5'10 you will struggle to squeeze in. Food portions were very small plastic fork and spoons mediocre and slow service. On a 8+ hour flight only served drinks once. Flights on all sectors were on time. Ran out of non-veg food on two sectors. Crew seemed amateur and clumsy. Except on the Jo'burg-Doha sector which was a daytime flight where the crew were cheerful and friendly they were grumpy on all other sectors. In between meals snacks were just a small packet of chips or chocolate. Snack with drinks only given on the Jo'burg-Doha sector were tasteless small bread sticks with a horrible salsa. Nuts would have been a 100 times better. Old hindi movies and very limited choice on TV channels. Never again on QR.

Alan Wan",,24th February 2015,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,Flew LHR-DOH-DAC. The trip started at the Qatar Business lounge at T4. I thought the lounge was excellent. Food service comfort all first rate. The first flight was on an A319 all business class. The plane feels very exclusive and the level of service and attention was superb. However as a solo traveller I would opt for a different aircraft if possible which allows every passenger direct aisle access. Saying that I sat on the aisle and my neighbour sitting at the window never woke me up getting to the loo. The food was the best I have experienced on a flight. The food I had particularly the main course - lamb with couscous were superb. The flight departed and arrived an hour late but on this occasion this was no problem as I had quite a long layover at Doha. The plane parked on a remote stand and we were bussed on a limo-coach type of coach. It was equipped with 12 spacious sofas. There was no queue at the transit security they x-rayed our bags and I was through to the Al Mourjan lounge within minutes. The lounge is huge with plenty of space to sit I found a sofa to lie down for a few hours before taking a shower and having lunch at the upstairs restaurant. This was a buffet affair rather than cook to order at LHR. Overall I cant knock the lounge it was lovely but I much preferred the LHR lounge it felt more exclusive and the food offering was much better. Unfortunately my flight was delayed by +2 hours and ended up eating again at the lounge. I tried the downstairs restaurant but it only served cold food so returned to the upstairs restaurant. I departed from gate A8 which took about 10 minutes to get to. Amazingly I was the only passenger in Business Class there are 30 seats in the Business cabin of the A330-300 and it was weird having 29 empty seats and 5 FAs to look after me. I had a glass of excellent Billicart Salmon Brut champagne as a pre-flight drink then a fabulous St Clair Sav Blanc with my meal. I chose the mushroom and basil oil soup followed by a rump of lamb. I was too full for a any dessert The food was not as good as the first flight and as expected for a 4 hour flight it was a three course meal rather than a seven course banquet. We arrived just after 2am and I was through immigration in no time. Mainly as there were so few passengers requiring to complete visa on arrival. The hotel had arranged for a fixer to collect me and deliver me to the car pick up point where the hotel mini-van was there to collect me.

Great food and beverage service. IFE was spot on too. DOH-DAC on A330 They used First Class seating as J seating so I managed to get a flat-bed. Food and beverage on that leg was not great dry possibly due to a delay out of DOH also the IFE has to be reset several times. Return sectors RGN-DOH was on the A330 comfortable seat once again the food from RGN wasn't great but I was hungry so ate it. DOH-LHR was on the Business One A319 aircraft.

Started off well in the lounge with good service but as soon as I stepped onto the plane the AC was not working. The plane set off with a known fault. During the flight my in-flight system was not working and eventually I gave up. Furthermore on landing we were held on the tarmac without any update from the pilot and to compound a totally miserable flight the walkway was unable to be used due to power loss (not the fault of QA but added to the misery with pilots going into radio silence). What saved me from scoring the trip satisfaction as 1/10 was the usual impeccable flight crew service - top class. QA can do much better and on this flight the experience was anything but a 5* standard.

Bob Mitchell",,18th February 2015,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,no,1,"QR836 Doha to Bangkok new Airbus A380 should have been seat 46c economy but moved for no technical reason to a small economy area on the upper deck right at the back of the aircraft. Seat 27G. I chose seat 46c because of its position forward of the leading edge of the wing which on other 380's such as Emirates and Singapore are both relatively quiet and comfortable in turbulence. This new position was noisy (engine) and dreadful in turbulence because you are so close to the tail. I understand airlines cannot guarantee your seat request ""for technical reasons"" but there was nothing wrong with the seat I had chosen. My guess is that as a solo traveller I was probably moved to accommodate a group of two or more travellers that left there checking in and seat reservations until the last minute. I would love to know why people who book flights five or six moths in advance should be penalised for others that either book last minute or don't check in until the last minute. I was told by the cabin purser that the ground staff had moved many people and that that many passengers had complained."

Aircraft on all flights equipped with PTVs and a great variety of entertainment features good food unlimited drinks including champagne whisky and cognac. Staff very nice and helpful composed of staff from around the globe speaking very good English. DOH-BKK-DOH onboard brand new A380 - the most comfortable flight I've flown. Plenty of legroom very wide PTVs and comfy seats. Now it's hard to change QR for anything else.

C Meier",,12th February 2015,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,8,4 flights 3 of them were a very nice experience. New planes on time and very fast good service. Flight nr. 4 (7h) was with a older A330 and the crew was not so motivated or a bit disorganised. Very slow service. They skipped the first run with drinks and snack and start to serve with the dinner after a while. It took more than 90 minutes to get the first drinks and some food. That flight was a very different experience and not what you expect from a 5 star airline. The new economy seats at the 787 are not very comfortable. hard narrow and a metal box under the seat.

J Stonfer",,12th February 2015,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,3,no,2,"Flew on 787 Dreamliner from Doha to Singapore. Must say I was so close to my neighbor that I was afraid we would amalgamate into one! All the other amenities and food experience went right out of the window. Anyway all the other things like food entertainment crew were good. But none of it matters when a 6"" slightly heavy guy sits in the plane. Qatar Airways might be doing a great job in the Premium Class but since majority of the people travel by economy it should rethink its strategy. Chances of me travelling on Qatar are very small."

R Johnston",,12th February 2015,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,,4,yes,8,I had the pleasure of flying with Qatar from NZ to Brazil return and I found there level of service and food superb the only thing they need to look at is their entertainment system it is not reliable at all I spent 28 hours over two flights going there and 23 hours coming back and over the 4 flights in each case I found when you plug your head phones into the socket it was loose and gave a distorted sound. Really annoying when your in a airplane for 14 hours straight. I encourage them to check their systems.

B Ghannadian",,12th February 2015,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,,,4,yes,6,I flew Qatar last month multiple times DFW-DOH-IKA-DOH-MED JED-DOH-IKA-DOH-DFW. Have to say I agree with one of the previous reviews regarding staff behavior change as soon as they see a business or first class ticket. Had to change my boarding pass in Dallas while staying in the line the staff were really inattentive and not caring. As soon as I handed over my boarding pass all of the sudden the attitude changed and maybe apologized 4-5 times for making me wait in the line! Flight attendants are nice. Very polite some happier than others but overall very attentive. The food selection was not appealing to my taste but good specially if you are a fan of middle eastern and Indian types of food. Drink selections were really good. The meals are served a la cart. Has its own cons and pros. It is good to have the option of having what you want when you want. However can be bothersome in a sense specially when the cabin lights are turned off and are trying to get some sleep and the passenger next to you is trying to eat. Overall more satisfied with the short haul business class flights compare to long haul. Seats are very comfortable and wide. Plenty of legroom. I would be happy if the seat had a little separator/divider to give a little more privacy while sleeping specially if the passenger next to you chooses to read watch TV or eat. Doha airport is huge. Not the best airport for short layovers. Make sure you have at lease 90 minutes between two flight. I had 50 minutes and missed my flight. If everything goes well and right on schedule 50 minutes would have been enough but can be too short if your flight is delayed even 5 minutes and plane is not parked at a jetway and passengers are taken to the airport by the bus and so on. Airport staff are nice. Some are really helpful some not much I guess like anywhere else. The lounge is huge. Very contemporary decor. Not many food or drink options in the main sitting area. Two restaurants which can be very over crowded. Restrooms are very insufficient.

M LaPrairie",,6th February 2015,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,JNB-DOH-KWI business class. Seat 4K on JNB-DOH on Dreamliner. On boarding went to lavatory to put on sweat pants and a tee-shirt and was offered on the way in a clothes hanger by the purser for the clothes I was changing out of. Nice touch. He came around and introduced himself to each biz passenger. One arm rest wouldn't move with the electronic function. Next thing I knew there was an engineer member of the ground staff lying in the aisle looking under my seat with a flashlight. Couldn't fix the problem but he sure tried. Food and service during the flight were excellent. Just before arrival in DOH the purser informed me that I would miss my connection to KWI and had been rebooked on a later flight. A member of the ground staff met me on disembarkment in DOH and took me immediately to the gate for my KWI flight which was delayed anyway due to fog in KWI. Lots of good attention from QR on these flights. I like the 1-2-1 seating in biz class on the 787.

M Verri",,6th February 2015,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,Milan to Nairobi via Doha. Both legs on A320 aircraft. The newer aircraft on the first leg provided softer seating and entertainment on demand while the older A320 on the second leg had harder seating and no entertainment. Legroom is an issue because of the entertainment box under the seat in front of you (F seats) but otherwise okay. Recline is generous even though people behind you complain that it invades their space.

Catering however for special diet (gluten free) was awful. Nicely presented but just dry chicken FOUR times over the 2 legs! GF is very easy diet to produce tasty meal. Just had a far better one on Qantas domestic flight in economy! Have flown all major airlines to Oz and this was the worst for me for food.

C McLuckie",,28th January 2015,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,no,4,Flew economy on Boeing 787 Dreamliner from Edinburgh to Bali via Doha. Worst seating I have encountered in economy. Not only are the seats very narrow but some design genius who has never flown economy thought it would be a good feature to locate a large IFE box under the seat so one leg will always be constantly rubbing against it. When the seat in front is reclined there is no room to move so the people in the window or middle seat are trapped. Service was ok but choice of movies not as extensive as Emirates.

The first flight was on an Airbus 330 and the second on an Airbus 340. The cabin attendants were friendly and helpful. A small wet towel to freshen up after wake up would have been nice before we ate breakfast. Both flights were punctual. Food was as good as can be expected on a flight. The new Hamad Airport in Doha can only be described as superb in every way. My next journey will be on 3rd February LHR-DOH-KTM and two further round trips expected this year. I will continue to use Qatar Airways.

I would not hesitate in recommending them. I believe this is the best economy class flight I have been on. Spacious seating tasty food and friendly attentive staff. I have experience of long haul flights where the cabin crew get the service out of the way as quickly as possible and then disappear behind a curtain for the rest of the flight. This was not like that at all. They were helpful throughout the flight. I was very impressed.

Daniel Ludwig",,28th January 2015,,Business Class,,,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,CMB-FRA business class. I took the night flight and I arrived rested in Germany 30 minutes earlier than expected so I was able to change my connecting flight within Germany and arrived earlier at my final destination in Germany. On my return to CMB in Frankfurt the ground handling staff were very impolite firstly when they didn't know which class I was in suddenly when they saw my ticket a smile appeared this shouldn't be every customer should be treated the same way. The flight from FRA to DOH had a delay therefore the connecting time to DOH to CMB was only 30 minutes. As earlier stated in some of the reviews from others some of the planes business class is just a better economic class as you are unable to rest. However I wouldn't mind recommending the airline.

M LaPrairie",,26th January 2015,,Business Class,,,5.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,6,QR708 IAD-DOH. Seat 3K. Not sure what happened to QR this evening but from the start it is not what one expects from this carrier. My last four trips with QR including this one have entailed lengthy business class check-in waits at IAD. Why can't QR at IAD have enough dedicated business class check-in counters to manage the flow of checking-in passengers in a way that prioritizes high yield customers? Waiting 30 minutes to check-in from the business class line while watching economy class passengers who arrived well after me breeze up to the counter is just not acceptable. QR needs to look at this seriously. This isn't the first time I've encountered this while checking in for this flight at IAD. The flight left early. Turbulence early on delayed the dinner service. However once it started the left aisle of the business cabin was on to their second course before passengers on the right aisle even had a drink. The purser should ensure consistency throughout the cabin. The FA working in my aisle asked if she could clear my service items before I'd even been served the main course. I informed her that I hadn't had dinner yet. When ordering appetizers I was told that one of my appetizer selections might not be available as many other passengers had ordered the same thing. Really? The business cabin is not full and I'm in row 3. My main course for the dinner a lamb shank with root vegetables was entirely under-whelming. When put in front of me the sauces were congealed. Once I started to eat it it was only tepidly warm. The purser came around and asked me how my meal was and I told her it was not hot and that it looked like it had been sitting for a while. I got a nice smile and an I'm sorry Sir but no offer to have it re-heated or replaced. What particularly irked me was that just minutes after take-off the purser went around the cabin summarily closing everyone's window shades. A hand appeared from the row behind me to close the window that I was looking out of at that moment admiring the night time view of New York. There's lots of time remaining just after take off on a night-time transatlantic flight for FAs to go around the cabin and discretely close the window shades before sunrise. Believe it or not some passengers may want to see the night-time lights of New York Boston Halifax or St. John's. If they want to close all the shades early on in the flight they can at the least ask passengers if they want their shades drawn rather than just briskly machine-like marching around the cabin closing them. Passengers typically chose window seats for a reason. Sorry QR not one of your better days.

David Gilbert",,21st January 2015,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,"MXP-DOH-INC - PEK-DOH-MXP. 3 flights out of 4 on the 777 1 on the 330. Business seat on the 777 far superior compared to the rather cramped and angled 330. What I liked on the 777 seat is the fact that there is plenty of space and no ""foot box"" so you can sleep in any position and have freedom of movement. The 330 had the ""foot box"" which restricts movement and is quite annoying and doesn't go flat. Service on all sectors was excellent as was food and wines. Couldn't fault the staff at all. Having a 7 hour layover on the outbound trip we went on the free Doha city tour which was well worth it. Back in time to relax for a couple of hours in the enormous lounge. Would recommend Qatar but beware of travelling on the cramped 330 business class which is ok for a day flight but not a night flight."

Elton Chapman",,21st January 2015,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,Outbound LHR-DOH-MEL return MEL-DOH-MAN. 3rd time flying Qatar business class. The Qatar lounge at LHR is incredible. Modern well designed comfortable with great staff and fantastic food and drinks on offer. We had a full breakfast with a couple of glasses of champagne and it was a great way to start our vacation. Our first flight from LHR was on the three class A340-600 and I was impressed. This was our first time on this aircraft type with Qatar and I was surprised how spacious it was. The angled lie flat seat was comfortable enough to get a few hours sleep. The galley is at the rear of business class so the front seats get served last. We had a couple of hours to kill in Doha before our next flight to Melbourne. This was our first time at the new Hamad airport. It was great not to have to do the long bus tour of the airport as you did at the old terminal. The business class lounge is really badly sign-posted but we found it eventually. The lounge was impressive but I think I was expecting more. Table service drinks throughout the lounge apart from one proper bar which is located upstairs. Return flights to Melbourne were on the 2 class 777. The space in business is incredible and the lie flat seats are comfortable. First time we've been given the mattresses which you now get with the usual PJs and slippers but only on night flights. I thought the mattress was a nice touch and added to the overall comfort. Our return flight from Melbourne used the Qantas business lounge which was really poor. Uncomfortable and a very poor selection of food and drink. I was glad to get out of there. Our Melbourne departure was delayed by 45 minutes and we only had a 65 minute transfer time at Doha. From my experience great customer service comes into play when things go wrong (like flight delays) and Qatar handled things superbly. We were met as we left the aircraft with details of our transfer gate and the aircraft was held on stand for us until we arrived. Our luggage was fast tracked and I was amazed to see it on the carousel at Manchester airport. The flight to Manchester was on the smaller A330.200 but again a great aircraft (slightly older) with an angled lie flat seat. Food and beverage on all flights was to a really good standard. But what really makes Qatar stand out though is the consistently high standard of service in business class. I was really impressed with this on all our flights and their five star status really is deserved.

The entertainment system didn't show any flight info or map. Doha to Bangkok - 1.5 hours into the flight they served a small snack - a spinach pie for vegetarians or chicken pie. After some 5 hours they served a small breakfast - nothing special for an 8 hours flight. The plane was an A380 which was the best of the 4 we travelled on during this trip. At least it was clean and comfortable for a long flight. For the SIN-DOH leg they used a B787 which was new but uncomfortable for tall passengers. Once seats recline it's practically impossible to eat or stand up. The breakfast 1 hour before Doha was so bad thst we gave it back untouched. Doha to Athens entertainment system at seat did not work but the A330 was not full so we could change seats. They served the same breakfast as SIN-DOH. The A330 was full of dust - the seat pocket was full of garbage from the last flight.

The service both on land and in flight was exceptional!!!! The food and food presentation was first class! A pure joy in relation to other airlines we have flown. The air stewards were always willing to help well dressed and had a good attitude at all times. There is ample leg room even with the entertainment box if there was one at our feet. If you wish to fly Qatar please take a converter for your personal headphones as theirs is a 2 prong. We had a 24 hour lay over in Doha. Qatar Airways granted us an accommodation and food voucher. Our stay in Doha was wonderful and memorable. It is an easy process at Hamad Airport to get the vouchers and board the shuttle to the relevant hotel. I was anxious about this period but it was an easy stay over. My husband and I highly recommend Qatar Airways.

Overall a very pleasant experience as the flight was clean and new the staff were extremely friendly and I loved the special meal options. We all had our own TV screens as well which was really entertaining. The only negative thing about Qatar Airways is that the legroom is very limited which disappointed me as I really needed some leg room to relax as I am 185 cm tall (a very normal height here in Europe). I hope Qatar Airways will provide some more legroom to its passengers.

B Wijesinghe",,19th January 2015,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,7,"DOH-CMB-DOH. Business Class. QR does not live up to its ""The World's Five Star Airline"" slogan on some routes. It could be three to four star service especially as they have varying business class products (seats IFE etc.) in their fleet. Outbound I carefully selected a B777-300ER when booking but they changed that later to an older A321 that did not have lie-flat sleeper seats on this 4.5 hour night flight that was scheduled to leave DOH at 01:05. It left DOH about an hour late due to the incoming aircraft's delay and failed to make-up the lost time when arriving in CMB. Boarding was very poor in DOH and CMB. The seats more like premium economy products in many airlines' fleets were most uncomfortable and the control buttons didn't respond well to make adjustments. No amenity kit was offered and the food served was slightly above average. It was good that there were only six passengers in the 12-seat cabin on that flight so we could spread out a bit. The two inflight staff members were very good and attentive. On the inbound flight the B777-300ER's seating product was in complete contrast to their A321 though still not on par with the latest offerings of some of their competitors and also their own B787/A380 business class products. The service and food were similar to the outbound flight. This flight was on time. The new QR business class lounge in DOH is outstanding and amazing in terms of design and services available. The new DOH airport itself is not as good as places like Changi in Singapore but a huge improvement over the old one. I would use QR again on this route due to their three daily flights to CMB and their OneWorld membership that allows me to earn Avios and Tier benefits as a Sapphire OneWorld member."

Considering the fact that I have some health issues pertaining to my back I was allotted a bulkhead seat with extra-leg space for the BRU-DOH 8 hour long sector. The welcoming by the cabin crew was very appealing and we were served with fresh towels and candies. The in-flight entertainment was also good since they had movies and other audio-visuals in the most updated forms. The food served was very delicious and was specifically served to me as per my special request for food. All the cabin crew were very pleasant and had a smiling face all the time which was very warming for everyone. The only drawback here was that the cabin crew being English speaking could not communicate with the mostly French and Dutch speaking passengers. Overall I recommend it for further trip. I have my return leg with Qatar Airways and will update you soon about my other experience.

I flew Cathay in First from LAX-HKG R/T just a few days earlier and felt that this experience was on par with CX First and in some areas even better - and that says a lot as CX is world class. In my 15 years of top tier business travel this business class experience stood out as the best. Right from the pre departure drinks service to the excellent restaurant style (and quality) meals to the amenities on board (excellent Ferragamo and Armani kits mattress pads duvets pyjamas superb champagnes) to the crew and the world class new lounge at Hamad - this was an experience! The Business/First lounge at Hamad is huge (not Emirates huge) but manageable. The shower amenities (L'Occitane) and the restaurants in the lounge are excellent (yes Krug is still being served in the business restaurant). The bus transfer (once) was in a bus with 8 lounge style sofa seats. A good way to start the new year!

M Khan",,19th January 2015,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,,,4,yes,8,Manchester-Doha sector.–While boarding had to wait in the walkway leading to the aircraft door as clearing of the aircraft was in final stages of completion unfortunately icy cold gusts of wind were funnelling into the tunnel. However all this discomfort was easily forgotten on seeing the warm and cheerful welcome we received from the two smart cabin attendants at the doorway. As usual Qatar airways aircraft was spotlessly clean. The 2-4-2 seating of the A332 is ideal for couples who wish to have their space remain uncompromised. The seat pitch of ~32” and width of ~18” is better than many other offerings which give a claustrophobic ‘sardine-can’ambience the cushioning is also more comfortable. The IFE has been upgraded to Touch Screen technology and the availability of Wifi is a further value addition. Service by the cabin staff was as good as ever. Flight deck crew also kept passengers updated on relevant flight parameters. Compared to my previous experience the only aspect that has slipped was the catering. On this sector breakfast and a snack were served I had requested a low-salt diet which was complied with in both instances but the quality of the offerings was very average tasteless and just warm the quantity of the serving has also diminished since my last economy class flight. Doha - Islamabad sector. Due to foggy conditions across parts of the North Indian sub-continent the flight was delayed by some 11 hrs. Though the airlines website stipulates that passengers whose transits exceed 8 hrs would be provided hotel accommodation commensurate with their class of travel they were unable to do so in many a case as the airport hotel had been totally booked they did however provide meal vouchers and make the ‘quiet rooms available to the stranded passengers which I feel did alleviate their plight to some degree. The flight left on time according to the new delayed schedule and service on board was as good as always cabin crew were very pleasant and helpful throughout catering quality/quantity somewhat less than previous experiences but quite acceptable. The aircraft was well maintained and the as clean and tidy as I have always experienced with Qatar Airways.

The leg room was very generous the seats extremely comfortable. This airline makes carriers from the USA and even Europe look very bad by comparison.

J Keep",,14th January 2015,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,10,LHR – DOH – MAA return on 21st – 31st December ’14. I flew the same route with Qatar in 2011 and was really impressed with the service at the time so was looking forward to the same thing this time travelling with my wife. On the day of our departure I was somewhat disappointed that due to a change of plane from A340 to A330 on the LHR-DOH leg my reserved seats no longer applied and we were stuck over the wing however we had at least been given seats together. It’s fair to say that our impression of Qatar’s in-flight experience for the whole of the first three legs (that is to Chennai and back to Doha on return) was good. All were on A330s (either -200 or -300s). The planes were comfortable with good leg-room (although beware of the entertainment box which takes up half the foot-space for all window seats) the cabin crew were attentive polite and friendly the food was impressively above average – all the seats seemed to have been refurbished on our planes and were comfortable. As for the new Doha airport even though we only had a 1 hour transit each way it was clearly outstanding with plenty of space to relax use the internet watch TV and many shops albeit expensive ones. Overall the impression was very good though I would have said it had lost that real supreme feel that had so impressed me in 2011. Then on our final leg from Doha – Heathrow I had managed to book this leg on the new A380. Suddenly the wow-factor returned! By some distance the best flight we have ever taken! Our seats had again been changed but boy were we glad! Between booking and flying I'd joined the Qatar Privilege Club and we’d been moved to the small economy section at the back of the top deck which had been fully blocked out when I reserved seats. Instead of 3-4-3 seating it’s 2-4-2 and the experience was great. Comfortable seats lots of legroom big HD quality IFE screens fantastic service from 2 dedicated cabin crew and 2 toilets for just 8 rows of seats storage box next to the window complimentary mini amenity kit for all economy passengers and of course that great feeling of walking up the stairs inside the plane to reach our seats. The fact that its such a small section of economy makes it feel pretty exclusive too. In economy? Fly the A380 if you can!

There seemed to be fewer cabin crew serving our side of the cabin and the guy we encountered most seemed very flustered almost as if it were his first day on the job. The printed menu card was substituted with a photocopied equivalent when our food order was taken and it featured a few changes none of them for the better. They also quickly ran out of rose champagne and one of the white wines. The next sector to EDI was superb particularly the attentive cabin crew.

R Nazmul",,11th January 2015,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,ARN-DOH-DAC and return in economy. ARN-DOH operated by a B787 and DOH-DAC operated by an A333. We had checked in online the night before so no long queues for us! Boarding was fast and efficient at ARN as usual. Was quite excited to fly on the 787 for the first time and I was fairly impressed by the mood lighting in the cabin. However the cabin felt quite cramped in this 9-abreast configuration. The load factor in Y was approximately 80%. The seats were decent the IFE was modern flight attendants were friendly and attentive and the food was great. Overall a great experience on this 6 hour flight. Transfer was smooth in the new Hamad airport. Next flight DOH- DAC on an A333. They changed the operating aircraft to a three class A333. The staff at DOH handled the situation well and new seats were given. My father got seated in business and the rest of us in Y. Flight was 95-100% full in Y. Overall a nice flight with friendly crew decent IFE and decent seats. The only letdown was the food. DAC- DOH operated by an A333 once again the flight was completely packed in business and economy. Boarding was smooth and we were off to DAC. Flight was great as usual with QR nice crew decent IFE and decent seats. The food was quite tasteless and once again the only letdown with this flight. Transfer in Doha was smooth as usual. DOH-ARN operated by A7-BCB I had bought the same plane in 1:200 from DOH. Load factor in Y was about 80-85%. The flight was great as usual except the food arrival at ARN was smooth. I was quite satisfied with QR except on the catering department. We chose QR because of the low fares and I would recommend them if the price is competitive.

These are excellent even if you don't want to sleep but just want to stretch out. The cabin service was the best I have experienced in Business Class. You can have your meals when you want them. The service was always there and always excellent without being obtrusive. We will certainly be flying with Qatar again this year.

Excellent seats on B-777 ER/LR superb food (presented first class style - not a tray in sight) awesome lounge in Doha and service from the crew - best I have experienced (and I fly over 150K miles/year with One World). In fact I was on Cathay First a couple weeks prior from LAX-HKG-LAX and this QR service was as good or better (certainly better food on QR business than CX First). Great seat comfort with mattress toppers and duvets and seat massage function Excellent wines (presented restaurant style) and Champagnes - flawless. My wife and 2 kids felt the same way.

My father was placed in business and the rest of us in economy. Flight was about 95% full. Once again a great experience with friendly flight attendants great IFE and decent legroom. Only one option for the meal which was okay nothing special. Return flight DAC-DOH operated by a two class A333. Fight was 100% full. Friendly and attentive crew as usual boarding was done efficiently. We had a great flight with excellent service as usual however the only let down was the food. Transfer in Doha-Hamad was smooth. Lovely airport. We had a pleasant flight as usual but the food was still quite bad. We were offered with one option which is quite bad IMO. We were able to choose from a handful of options on the outbound flight (ARN-DOH). However I had excellent flights with QR nonetheless and I would gladly choose them again in the future!

B787-800 DOH-CPH-DOH on B787-800 and A330-200 on the DOH-SGN leg. Food good but much less and of slightly deteriorating quality as compared to previous flights. FA’s professional hard working coping and caring despite the flights were full. Economy on 787 is nothing above normal seats are cramped and exit seats cannot always decline. Gold-tier members recognised in economy (2 out of 3 times). Champagne made available on all flights. Bus-transfers in Doha still frequent and tedious and constitute anti-climax on otherwise spotless trips. New Al Mourjan lounge in Doha huge impressive but lacks personality decorations and toilets. Meals on order.

The standard of service in business class on all flights was very good. The best being the Doha - Perth flight were the flight attendants were particularly attentive. All food on all flights was excellent. Again the food on the Perth - Doha flight was particularly good. Found the 787 seats from Joburg to Doha more comfortable than the 777. You did not need a mattress on this flight as the seat in the lie flat position is so well padded. I love the pod with the extra table room and the shoe storage area. Even with the mattress double thick on the 777 you can still not sleep comfortably on your side. Did not have this problem on the 787. All flights were on time or early. Not a huge fan of the new business class lounge at Hamad Int'l. Not as well designed or sign posted inside as it should be. The seating is great but the design does not flow for me. Will continue to fly with Qatar as they offer one of the best business class products in the air.

Very good service from the crew but can be a bit slow in getting drinks and food out. Business cabin is what you would expect from a quality airline like QR very good. IFE is good and food is not bad for airline food. All flights were on time. Business class in the dreamliner is excellent would love to fly a longer route on it. The lounge in DOH is excellent and massive! The Lounge in Phuket is a joke operated by Thai Airways I dont know why QR use it as the lounge beside it which Etihad use is much better. Definitely would fly Qatar again and recommend them.

Two flights from and to KUL was operated by an A330-200 while both the flights to and from CDG was operated by their all new A380. First leg was a night flight and the crew was fantastic! They were friendly smiling all the way and nit showing the rushing face even though it was quite a full flight. Food and beverages good portions not too small and had a wide selections of beverages as for IFE selections was ok for adults but for kids not very much. On all the other 3 legs crews were very robotic but did their job. The A380 was a great plane seats were spacious enough and modern. Noticed food catered from DOH not that good but still edible... Pilots on all flights landed perfectly but they seem to be mumbling all the time. Price of tickets were very reasonable and affordable. Thumbs up for Qatar Airways!

Full flight but cabin crew maintained a good friendly service. Have used Qatar over last few years on this run. Standard of food has gone down quite noticeably and beverage service not as frequent as in past (although a full flight could explain this). IFE very poor and aircraft seemed ""grubby"" (clean but well used). Doha - Man. Airbus 330. Seats tight in width but good IFE aircraft appeared very new. Flight 2/3rds full but cabin service was very poor. Cabin crew sullen only appeared at food serving time and seemed to spend rest of flight sitting on their crew seats looking very unhappy (they did not even appear to chat to each other). Certainly the worst long haul cabin crew i have experienced (the one exception being Iberia on a trip to Argentina). Maybe this was a one off but certainly I will now consider an alternative airline for this run."

The attendants were lovely and the food wasn't bad (it has certainly improved since my first Qatar flight). However the movie selection was dreadful as usual. I do not understand why they can't have a good selection of recent releases as all the general movies they show have been seen 100 times! The flight from Doha to Paris was great - comfortable and I love the new Doha airport. Despite the IFE I would still travel to Paris from Perth on Qatar because they have really great take off and landing times both ways.

Great if US carriers could copy this modely especially for coast-to-coast travel in the US. Service was obliging for this one-hour sector. Connected in DOH to IAD on a 777-300 and was in seat 6K. Overall service was good but somewhat slow due the chief purser having to spend an inordinate amount of time dealing with one selfish and disruptive passenger from Qatar who insisted on bringing his toddler up from economy even though the child not was ticketed in business. He loudly argued with the flight attendants including telling them that he was friends with the Qatar Airways CEO. The chief purser handled the situation admirably and the child was eventually taken back with his nannies in economy. This overly entitled passenger though the plane was his own and that he could do as he liked. Food was good. Call button not always answered very promptly. Washroom kept clean. A great product overall.

Overall OK food was OK options finish quickly and you have to manage with what is available. Leg room was OK restricted due to entertainment box under the seat. Few things that they may need to look into: Check in staff at Dubai yawning at 8am in morning not as welcoming as we expected. Doha-Colombo sector too cold inside the aircraft for many passengers but repeated request by us to make it a little warmer did not yield any result. Aircraft was clean and well maintained good entertainment system and options. This was 1'st Qatar airline experience will fly them again but not worth becoming loyal to them.

First leg on a full to capacity 777. The cabin crew were excellent in dealing with a full aircraft but the IFE was very poor and limited in choice of films. Also I feel that the standard of food served has fallen considerably. The aircraft itself looked ""tired"". The leg Doha to Manchester in an A330 was a contrast. Very nice aircraft with good IFE food still of a very average standard but the real difference was the cabin crew. I got the distinct impression that we were a nuisance and interrupting their rest time. No smiles indeed they were quite sullen and spent most of the flight sat on their seats by the galley not even chatting to each other. I doubt very much that I will use Qatar again."

The flights to London were good and especially the first leg with excellent service from the staff. Good food too. But the return was less good. Especially the final leg Doha to Bangkok. We left Doha around 1am and it would have been nice to get a good meal to settle us down for the 6 hour flight but they just brought us a miserable sandwich. 2 hours before arriving into Bangkok - around 10 am - I expected a nice breakfast - nothing too heavy - but the food options were dinner-based - so beef or chicken with veg etc. I think we just wanted eggs or croissants with coffee. I've flown with Qatar many times and I find the service quite variable. The stop-over in Doha bus connections is now a drag.

L Buttle",,18th December 2014,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,5,yes,6,LHR-DOH-PER-DOH-LHR. Flew the 4 sectors on 777-300 ER recently in Economy. They do a lot of things very well but Seating Inflight Entertainment and Beverages really harm their efforts. Seating is reasonable but what a nonsense on all 4 sectors the recline was! Goes back much too far clears any food and drink off of the table into the lap of the person behind I saw it happen twice and had a very narrow escape myself! When food and drink are not an issue the screen on a fully reclined seat is too much in your face. Drinks were infrequent and if you ordered a Spirit mixer eg. gin & tonic they mixed it for you (in varying strengths) rather than give you the standard small spirit bottle and separate mixer. Small point but again not 5 star standard. Inflight entertainment was good but not great. These are like for like comparisons if the price and schedules are better with Qatar then you may prefer to overlook these issues. Drinks and IFE are small irritations but compared to others they are falling short.

Benjamin Lawrence",,18th December 2014,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,7,Flew NRT-DOH-JNB return. The leg between Tokyo to Doha was on a 777. Quite comfortable. Service was excellent and the staff very attentive. The crew definitely put in the added little extra attention that makes the difference. Aircraft very clean etc. Trip from Doha to South Africa on the 787. While this aircraft is rather impressive I found the entire experience heavily marred by the presence of the entertainment box under the seat in front of you. This can really make it nigh on impossible to get into a comfortable position. I had read the reviews and didn't think it would be such a big deal. At the beginning it isn't but after some hours it starts to become a problem. On the way back I was actually relieved to get off the 787 and onto the 777 for the trip to Tokyo. Having said that the service on the 787 was of the same high standard that made up for the seat discomfort caused by the entertainment box. All in all the airline itself is excellent and the service quality very high. Qatar definitely deserve the 5 star rating that they have. Would definitely fly Qatar again definitely. But would try to avoid the 787.

Qatar is pleasant and reliable food was below average even for Economy cabin was about 80% full so was able to get an open seat next to me. Entertainment is average not as comprehensive or as up to date as Emirates. Staff were ok but somehow seem cool and disengaged or at least not as personable as on other carriers 777 aircraft was fine service was on time new Doha airport is very handsome and much improved with great lounge space accessible to frequent travelers even holding Economy seats. Not clear why Doha sometimes still uses bus connections to remote parking for arriving flights.

Apart from the Doha/Dubai leg the other flights were only half full so people could spread out and have the centre 4 seats to sleep. However I really would not say it is a five star service! The meals were OK nothing special and the portions not that large. The inflight entertainment was very good in my opinion. No amenity kits with socks or eyeshades for a 6 hr flight! On all 4 legs I found the crews very well groomed professional but not exactly warm and friendly.

Robert Szocik",,10th December 2014,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,,5,yes,5,Booked MAN-DOH-HKG return. DOH-HKG operated by CX so this review refers only to the MAN-DOH sectors. Outbound flight in a modernised A330 with a much smaller IFE box under the seat (makes a big difference to leg room) return flight in an older A330 with the much-larger IFE box and the older-style IFE interface. Leg room not an issue as both flights were half-empty so I had the whole row to myself. Seats on both sectors were very uncomfortable: I always found them comfortable before and the seats look quite new so I suspect that cheaper/uncomfortable seats are now being installed. Cost-cutting and deteriorating standards are now evident elsewhere: tray tables not properly cleaned less food than on previous flights (and worse quality) poorly maintained toilet facilities and very unhappy-looking FAs on both flights. Online booking page kept returning server errors - I tried to make changes to my schedule on several occasions back home as well as in Hong Kong with similar errors noted in both countries. I'm hoping that all this was just a one-off or perhaps QR's previously flawless service has led me to expect too much. But for the first time I didn't enjoy the flights that much at all. It won't stop me from booking with them again but if this situation continues I will definitely consider switching to another carrier for my flights to east Asia. However both flights were early and the fares were excellent value even after paying for a change of flights.

Got on board and after an hour informed that the overhead lights don't work and that the crew had informed ground personnel about the problem before push back but that nothing could be done. I would have appreciated being informed by the crew when they introduced themselves that there was a problem with the overhead lights particularly given that it is a daytime 14-hour flights when some passengers may wish to work. Service on board was good. Food was very good well presented and prepared and very tasty. Flight departed on time. Check in easy with lots of staff to greet and provide directions. Overall a good product at a competitive fare for business class from the US to the Gulf States.

A330 not as good as the 777 and feared the angled flat seat and then had the best night's sleep I've had on a plane! Best flight of the lot for service and food. A320 CMB-DOH with a regional business class seat for 5.5 hour flight worst flight of the 4 despite a lovely crew. Just not a suitable seat for that length of flight - the 2 other flights from CMB are A330 and 777 with a ""proper"" business class seat. I wouldn't do this flight again but it did work with the schedule I needed. Delayed and therefore missed my connection in DOH as India closed it's airspace due to a missile test. Not Qatar's fault and very well handled was re-booked before I checked in on to the later LHR flight. A319 all business class. Comfortable seat OK food not a great crew overly attentive again and far too many announcements. Felt claustrophobic in such a small plane for a 8 hour flight. Suggest QR get a widebody on that flight and make some more money with economy passengers and cargo - would be better for everyone! Overall not a bad experience a good price and I would fly QR if the price and schedule worked."

Flight crew promised to ""reset"" my system after completing inflight meal service but never did anything or came back to inform me. After about 2 hours I again informed another flight attendant who ""tried to reset"" with no success.

Selected them solely based on good reviews and 5 star status and wanted to try their new A380 to LHR. CGK-DOH leg was in a B777-300ER quite a new plane great IFE with very big screen on time departure and early arrival in Doha very good inflight service as well. Our flight to LHR was delayed by 2 hours due to aircraft changes. It is no longer A380 but they changed it to an old A340-600 to make the matter worse despite checking in on time and getting our preferred seats (window and middle seat as we are a couple) due to the aircraft changes they put us in the middle seat of 4 between 2 other strangers. The seat layout is 2x4x2 why cant they just put us as a couple in the window/aisle seat? Aircraft is showing its age and entertainment is limited unlike the B777 service was so-so and meals are inedible. Very cramped seats and legroom is not that great compared to B777. They changed the gate twice during the delay and we had to walk from end to end at Hamad International Airport just to find out that our flight was delayed. Not a very good experience especially considering DOH-LHR is one of QR's flagship route.

M LaPrairie",,20th November 2014,,Business Class,,,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,IAD-DOH-KWI business class on Nov 9. At check in IAD I asked the agent if there were any infants seated in the first economy bulkhead as I was in the last row of business class. He said there were two infants booked on the flight but both were located at the back of the aircraft. An infant which screamed for the first two hours of the flight was located right behind me. At check in there was an empty seat in the first business cabin that I would have happily taken had I known an infant was seated behind me. Onboard I called the Chief Purser and complained to her. She agreed that the check-in agent should have told me and was going to follow up. At check in there is no reason why the web-check in baggage drop only counter should be closed before the entire check-in counter closes. I ended up behind a huge family traveling in economy with mountains of bags who checked in at the business counter and haggled endlessly over excess baggage charges causing me to wait about 15 minutes to check in - all the while the web check-in counter was unattended. I had a delicious lamb entree from IAD-DOH although the piece of meat was the size of a silver dollar. New lounge in DOH is pretty nice. I had a shower which was available as soon as I asked. Well equipped lounge with lots of dining options and very spread out. DOH-KWI was on the new 787. The interior of the cabin is cool with great ambient lighting and seat comfortable. I like the sparkling rose before take-off. I wish the sector had been a bit longer to enjoy it more. All flights were spot on time.

P Amit",,12th November 2014,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,Have been a regular on Qatar Airways during last 3 years on Delhi-Doha-Lagos. Travelled in Economy and Business. Experience in economy is mixed. Seating is ok in 2x4x2 configuration but less keen on the 3x3x3 configuration which seems cramped. Staff service can be variable on Doha-Delhi sector - especially with people who are not comfortable speaking English. Business class is quite good. Very comfortable. Cabin crew feed you like crazy. Choice of food and wine is good. Ground handling and luggage service is good.

Zafrullah Hamzah",,12th November 2014,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,,3,yes,7,First time flying Qatar Airways from Paris CDG to Kuala Lumpur via Doha return. First leg unsatisfactory as the 2-2-2 cabin felt quite cramped. Staff forgot my main course but apologised and this was quickly sorted out. At the lounge in Doha there was a wait for the shower but staff were efficient and I got a shower room within 15 minutes. Doha to Kuala Lumpur was excellent. Great service onboard. Return trip KL to Doha similarly good. However food was at best only average on these flights. Doha to Paris was in first class. On arrival in Doha the lounge was the same as the previous - no separate first class lounge. Another wait to have a shower but this was quick and got a shower room in less than 10 minutes. Service onboard the Doha to Paris flight in first class was excellent. The stewardess was attentive and efficient. There were no other passengers in the first class cabin so I felt really pampered. Unfortunately the food was only average and the entertainment channels were not that great. Pity as the service onboard was top class. I also noticed that the advertised chauffeur drive from the terminal to the plane for first class was not made available to me. Overall I find Qatar Airways provide great service onboard but I would have some hesitation flying with them in the future for a few reasons. Firstly I prefer airlines that offer Business Class seats with direct access to the aisle. Secondly the lounge while impressive should have more shower rooms to cope with the volume of passengers. Thirdly Qatar does not provide a limousine service to and from the airport. Finally the food and entertainment onboard should be better. For flights to and from Kuala Lumpur the option of Malaysian dishes should be provided. The choice of music needs to be revamped. I will be comparing prices with other airlines closely before deciding if I would fly Qatar Airways again. I would recommend it for their excellent staff onboard but the service on the ground can be improved.

Tercon Bojan",,11th November 2014,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,10,Finally I get to fly on the Dreamliner! And Qatar Airways made the experience world class. As you board the plane you notice your first difference. The entrance of the 787 is very open and grand. You nearly feel like you're walking into a lobby area. Then you notice the windows which are truly big. Love the expansive feeling you get by being so connected to the outside. When you finally get to the new business class seat which has a very spacious 1-2-1 configuration you realize why Qatar is one of the few 5-star airlines. The reverse herring bone layout has you facing into the large windows and has by far the best design I've ever seen given this configuration even in sleep mode. An excellent dining experience. If there is one slight doubt it's with the new IFE system which takes some time getting used to. It's a complete redesign and not always logical. At least to me. Did I mention the spacious lavatories? Their Dreamliner experience is perfection.

Fro Kalle",,6th November 2014,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,,5,yes,7,Heathrow-Doha-Ho Chi Minh B777-300ER and it was a pleasant and a comfortable journey. Great cabin crew very friendly and polite. The food onboard seems less then last time in 2013 and that was a bit disappointment. Transfer at DOH beautiful new airport great design. Flight from Doha to Ho Chi Minh with the A330. The IFE onboard seems pretty old old seats and no touch screen. Many movies but not so many movies in the action category. SGN-DOH - Pleasant and an enjoyable flight. Landed on time. The problem was that my next flight to Doha- Oslo was leaving 9 hours later so pretty boring to wait so long. Great restaurant and food in the airport. B787 for the next flight. Good flight but I found out that the music didn't work and played different songs to those selected. Food was ok but I wish it was more. I sat on the back and didn't get my choice of food but that was ok. Landed on time at Oslo. I do recommend Qatar Airways.

Dianne Averis",,6th November 2014,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Superb service with Qatar on business class. The only downer is the lounge in Paris which is shared with a few other airlines and offered only packaged snacks and a few sandwiches. Inflight - so nice to be able to choose when we wanted to eat. The food was fresh and delicious and presented to us whenever we wanted. The service could not have been better. Yes and pyjamas and the extras too. Qatar were superb in every way (did I mention the Krug at the lounge in Doha?) If only they flew into Adelaide!

Daniel Sharon",,3rd November 2014,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,,,4,no,6,TBS-DOH-MXP. Both aircraft's seemed relatively new but the heating made it unbearable (especially on the TBS-DOH leg). It felt like a sauna and even the crew agreed but couldn't do anything about it. The vegetarian meals I ordered were not inspiring. The light snacks are a piece of sweet and a piece of savoury. The savoury was just OK the sweet was dry and burned i.e: inedible. On board Staff were miss and go. Most of the crew (Asians and Arabs) were friendly and genuinely eager to please but some of the Eastern European ladies were cold and not very approachable. Doha Airport is new and impressive. My connection was 5 hours long and so I went to the Ortyx Lounge that charges around $40 (140QR). The Lounge was very busy (500+ people) and there is only one shower facility. Luckily I found a slot to shower else the onward flight would have been even more awful than the first. I was happy to got an emergency exit seat (10D) on the DOH - MXP flight to discover this was the worst possible choice of seat. It is on an 'angle' and so it provides even less legroom than the regular seats with people going in and out of toilet and the crew bumping into me non stop.

Peter Lewis",,3rd November 2014,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,LHR-DOH on new A380 service. Interior very similar to Dreamliner - fantastic seat and big personal screen. Additional storage with side bins on the upper deck. Spent much of the flight in the Bar - very cool and whilst perhaps a bit of a gimmick it was very nice and with great service. Toilets were the poshest I have seen. These planes were a long time coming for Qatar but in my view well worth the wait - only trouble is it will make flying anything else (except perhaps their Dreamliner) a bit of a chore!

M R Higgins",,3rd November 2014,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,,,5,yes,9,Manchester - Doha - Bangkok. Check in at Manchester excellent as usual given pass to Escape Lounge which in all MAN-DOH-DPS and BKK-DOH-MAN. Took these flights a couple of weeks ago and on every one of the 4 flights the service and the food were indeed 5 star quality. The service in the business class lounge at Doha was also excellent. The only gripe I would have on the flights is that the choice of movies is very poor - Premieres and recent releases I really don't think so.

Thomas Johnston",,31st October 2014,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,Manchester - Doha - Bangkok. Check in at Manchester excellent as usual given pass to Escape Lounge which in all honesty isn't the best I’ve been in but as it was almost empty its OK to while away an hour or so plus they come and tell you when your gate is open. Unfortunately the usual carryon once in the departure area of people standing directly in front of the doors despite being told to sit down and wait for the announcements a few passengers tried to follow the wheelchairs through the doors. Priority boarding for business class and silver card holder resisted the temptations to smirk at the clowns still blocking the doorway and headed for the business cabin within a few minutes of boarding a flight attendant had already take my order for a drink so settled down and waited for takeoff. Bangkok to Doha is on Airbus 300 which I actually prefer to the Boeing 777 the cabin is smaller and I think more comfortable senior flight attendant introduced herself to all passengers and we then took off on time. Flight was very pleasant little turbulence so managed to consume all meals watch a few video and doze prior to arriving in Doha. The usual excellent Qatar staff advised on leaving the aircraft that you didn't need a pass for the lounge just to show your boarding card but as I was only in transit for 90 minutes I didn't have much time to spend there. Doha to Bangkok is on the 777 were the economy passengers have to troop though business so it seemed to take ages the cabin was hot and I don't usually feel the heat and stunk of perfume changed in the pyjamas (am I the only person who does) and tried to get some sleep prior to arriving Bangkok were the cabin crew handed out fast track passes on departing the aircraft. The return two weeks later was again a fine flight on both legs of the journey the only problem of your outward / return flight being in the same month is you have the same movies so stuck to the TV shows I'd missed spent almost 9 hours in transit in Doha thankfully the new brilliant new business lounge is open. Between Doha and Manchester I got a nose bleed and within minutes a was being tended to by 5 crew members with tissues towels and a bag of ice. Throughout the rest of the flight whichever member of the flight crew that passed checked I was OK or if I needed anything. I've seen some recent comments that Qatars very high standards have slipped quite a lot my experience is the complete opposite I've always believed their product to be vastly superior to their rivals in the gulf and nothing on my trip has changed my opinion that Qatar have by far the best cabin crew and ground staff around. I've already booked another two flights with my favourite airline.

W Coulton",,28th October 2014,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,PER-DOH-FRA with return CDG-DOH-PER. All flights on 777-300ER except DOH-FRA which was an older A330-300. This was our first time with QR (would normally use SQ or CX for this type of trip)and we were quite impressed with the overall economy service. Planes were quite clean and well maintained although the A330 was definitely showing its age. We found all staff to be professional and in general were quite friendly even if smiles were a little limited. The economy food was surprisingly good and varied plus of decent quantity. Alcohol limited without asking but always available. Call buttons seemed to get quick attention from what we observed. All flights on time or early except for one which was only 20 minutes late. I found economy seat comfort and legroom acceptable despite being 192cm tall. Very happy the QR 777 is 9 abreast and not the 10 across that some others try to squeeze in. Connection in DOH was a breeze (we had over 2 hours each way). Based on these 4 flights we are happy to recommend QR and will include them in future considerations.

W Simpson",,28th October 2014,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,Travelled BKK-DOH-EDI on 10 Sep and was impressed with all aspects of QR. Use of THAI lounge at BKK is a real let down. Inflight service excellent. DOH Business Class lounge excellent. Returned EDI-DOH-BKK on 15 Oct. Flight departure delayed by 1 hour which caused some anxiety given a 1.5h stopover. But this was made up so there was a 55 minute stopover allowing us and our luggage to connect successfully. Inflight service on both sectors excellent. Boarding at DOH chaotic with no accessible separate boarding at gate for Business. Food is OK but not exceptional. But any downsides are certainly made up for by service which is above and beyond.

First leg DXB-DOH was ok onboard a new A320 transfer at DOH was smooth and efficient thanks to the excellent PC Gold and Business class lounge. However ground staff was very disorganised looking like headless chickens. Second leg onboard new A330-200 ok but food was just awful. New 330 seats are also quite cramped. Both flights on time. Definitely a right choice.

In-flight services and entertainment were good however food were below average for a premium airline. Seating arrangement on the Dreamliner economy class were 3x3x3 found it inconvenient for couples especially seating by the windows. Seating space were just okay for small built any taller than 1.75m might be a tight squeeze. Our inbound transit at Hamad Doha were from remote parking bay. Although bus shuttle to the terminal were smooth we were quite disappointed that such a premium airline felt very much budget oriented. The only consolation was we got the tickets cheap during promotion. The saving grace was flights were punctual for all 4 sectors which is very important to any traveler.

The first part GRU-DOH we flew out on a 777-200LR it was clean inside and we loved the full flat bed. The other part DOH-SIN on their new 787 a first time for me on the Dreamliner excellent airplane. Very good seat pitch and width. We had a excellent staff service in both parts. Flight attendants readily and frequently serve you drinks or snacks. Food was tasted fresh and the best airline food we have tasted quite frankly.

Hubby and me + 3 kids aged 8 months 5 year-old and 9 year-old. All the crew were really helpful with the kids. They even allowed my baby to sleep on the unused seat. I cannot imagine how tedious it could be travellling with 3 kids but surprisingly everyone in my family was more than comfortable flying Qatar Airways. Will definitely use Qatar Airways again.

Geoff Harris",,13th October 2014,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,,3,no,4,Qatar Airways has really gone downhill at least from the UK. I have flown with them several times to Asia over the last 8 years and it was OK but last week I went to Dubai via Doha. Unless I have got a lot bigger the seats are cramped and uncomfortable and designed so that when the person in front reclines you have hardly any room. The food was average too. Then I had only one hour to change at Doha and had to literally run to get my connecting flight to Dubai as the airport is quite big. Exhausting. On the way back the check in lady at Dubai told me the flight was quiet (it wasn't) and again the seats were really cramped so much so my leg ached. The inflight crew were bossy and you very much were made to feel like a second class citizen in Economy. They couldn't even serve you a cold beer. I will book Emirates next time.

Flight was 20 minutes late being pushed back and then we spent 30 minutes riding round the airfield no announcement why we were delayed. Business class only half full so service was excellent. Food offered was uninspiring but drinks were good and were refilled regularly. No comfort pack supplied on this flight. Seats were very comfortable and the 777 is in my opinion better than the A330.

G Taylor",,13th October 2014,,Business Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,10,Edinburgh-Doha-Male return. Check completed in under five minutes but surprised no fast track through security Qatar use the No 1 traveller lounge adequate but nothing special. Boarding was quick and staff apologised for small delay whilst a family with young children boarded in front of us. We flew the Dreamliner and had chosen window seats specifically with my partner seated directly behind me. Seat was very comfortable and the general cabin ambience was excellent the cabin layout is 1x2x1. Served a very nice rose champagne after boarding food choice of wines and entertainment all very good. Crew excellent and very attentive flight departed on time was a bit concerned as we had a fairly tight connection but we arrived early into Doha - security was a breeze with a dedicated Business class area and we passed through in under 5 minutes. Had time to make a quick visit to the new lounge and very pleasing on the eye. Onward flight was on an A320 with the newly refurbished cabin seat excellent and very comfortable - even managed a few hours sleep. On arrival and departure from Male they now have a fast track desk for Business class passengers. On return through Doha Business class immigration processing took around 20 minutes the queues for Economy were fairly large and doubt those in that queue would clear in anything under an hour. Checking in at Doha on the return was very quick and Hamad Airport pretty special small queue in front of us so asked to take a seat for no more in 2-3 minutes and a staff member came over and assisted us with the bags to check in. Had more time to see the new Al Mourjan Lounge this time it's very large good choice of food and lots of seating although at 06.00 it was very busy. All in all great experience and would have no hesitation flying Qatar on future trips.

Plane was fairly new clean and comfortable a good flight. DOH-LHR was supposed to be a B787 but was changed to an A340 with no notice. Originally selected 2 seats together (window and aisle) these were changed to 1 window and 1 middle row several rows away. Only found out at online check-in. Managed to get 2 seats together with negotiation with other passengers. Cabin staff did not assist. Return LHR-DOH again supposed to be a B787 was changed to a B777ER. Plane still OK but older. Again seats changed (2 together this time) with no notification and further back than originals. Food a little better than average and cabin staff attentive. Seat leg room good but seemed hard. Overall a good airline- Doha airport is big and roomy but few places to get coffee if you have a wait. No alcohol but that is expected.

Business class was full. Took off bang on time and was informed that dine on demand was available. When looking at the menu it seemed that there was only a choice of snacks or omelette and chicken sausage. Companions IFE did not work and had to be reset four times. For a seven hour flight I was very disappointed with the food offered. Flying to Thailand in February 2015 I will not be using Qatar for this journey.

Check-in in Hanoi and Bangkok smooth and excellent. Lounge access without problem (as gold card holder). Lounge in Hanoi suffer from dormant staff busy with own activities but the airport view is gorgeous and food is plenty though mainly industrial. Onboard recognized and nourished as gold member. New wines in economy and for the first time after 50 flights with QR they changed the beer to Foster from the usual Heineken. So a boring brand replaced by an even more boring brand. However hot snacks were tasty service on board excellent and caring. From BKK till Hanoi 3 days later I was upgraded to business class by 8 only Q-credits (from Privilege FF-Program). What a pleasure in the Airport as fast track gives you better service. The Lounge (they use Thai Airways lounges) was very spacious and quiet but no wines nor champagnes were offered. Food displayed nicely but hardly acceptable except for loads of Chinese dishes (all Chinese tend to go to Thailand these days as they are not welcomed in Vietnam). The QR flight (got seat 1K in a 2x2x2 configuration) and service onboard was very very good and matches that of a 5-stars airline as Qatar retains.

New HIA Doha Airport is really efficient and comfortable also new Business Class lounge is really fantastic despite of a poor dining offer.

I have flown Qatar Airways many times already and always have had a good experience. Started of rather good but then the cabin came to take my dinner order. I asked to have red wine with my dinner after take off however nothing came until I had finished my dinner. The cabin crew said that they had been busy. I was not very impressed with the service but it was only on this particular flight and this particular cabin crew that did not know how to provide a proper service to a premium customer. But my flight from Doha to Bangkok everything was excellent. Therefore on this occasion I would only give Qatar Airways 5 stars out of 10 on Trip Satisfaction.

C W Li",,19th September 2014,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,Among world class airlines and its 5-star competitors like Cathay Pacific Qatar definitely holds its own. This past summer I took a trip from Philadelphia US to HK and the overall quality is definitely quite exceptional. The seats were comfortable enough considering the long flight the leg room was decent for economy class and the food was at least a step up from average. What stood out the most was their customer service both onboard and on theground. Flight attendants readily and frequently serve you drinks or snacks. There was a mishap in my journey in which I was stuck in Doha for a day one of the three options I was given. I will never regret it. They provided complimentary stay at a cozy hotel (along with 3 meals!) and I got to see the beautiful city. The only slight drawbacks was the longer-than-required duration of the flight (not direct route and trip from PHL to DOH was an hour late) and the arrival / departure time gap is short enough to cause problems if the first flight is late but how it played out made it worth the while. Overall worthy of being a top international airline and recommended. Will fly (am flying!) with them again.

Boarding was organized with families with kids first and people with special needs. Then Business class and priority customers. The flight originates in Doha so there were people on-board already - they aren't required to disembark on the transit stop. Economy was around 80% full while Business looked 30-40% full. Flight attendants were great! Super friendly - handed out headphones and served a very good meal of either chicken or pasta. AVOD entertainment is fantastic - the 2 1/2 hour flight went by quickly. Bags were unloaded by the time you cleared immigration and I was in a taxi in 20 minutes after disembarking. Always love to travel on Qatar Airways.

R Raj",,14th September 2014,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,no,7,We traveled from Philadelphia to Singapore this summer. Flights were enjoyable both ways. Crew was excellent but at times they get too comfortable and not attend to basics - my little one did not get a toy or anything though the attendant paid much attention to one family with a baby on our flight back from Doha to Philadelphia). The first issue we had was with the transit first leg it was about 19 hours Qatar Airways did not provide transit accommodation. We paid USD 125 each to get the transit accommodation (beware of the limitation of the allowance for Meals even with this paid service ours covered only 2 meals which was not that great in Swiss-belhotel) on the return journey it was an hour and a half with long walk between terminals to security check and back to gate there was no consideration for short transit passengers. Second issue was with food preference we had 2 vegetarian meals ordered which were not offered on way to Singapore though I had talked to Attendants they confirmed our meal preference; but asked me to talk to a Supervisor in one of transit gates who promised it will be corrected in other legs which did not help much. I will consider flying with them again due to convenience flying out from Philadelphia.

J Geno",,10th September 2014,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,Flew IAD-DOH-SHJ (Sharjah outside Dubai) during a promo sale in mid-May. Food quality and entertainment options were phenomenal. Movies were up to date and seat width and legroom was decent. Comfortable cabin atmosphere on the long-haul legs and good cabin service. My requests for snacks and ice cream were honored and added satisfaction to the flight. The repeated on-screen play of the menu was disruptive to IFE though. Appreciated the youth and gentleness of in-flight staff especially on the short-haul flights. Even the short-haul flights had delectable snacks. The only trouble was the since-decommissioned Doha International Airport was not sufficient to handle QR's busy network and operations. Had we not seen monitors in other parts of the airport we would have definitely missed our flights. QR's flights to/from the States tend to be pretty packed because of service to/from South Asia.

Henden Ronald",,6th September 2014,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,Up coming trip. LHR-DPS Booked First 380 Biz 787. Late delivery 380 so changed to 777 no issue but downgraded to Biz. with no communication from Qatar of downgrade. Only found out when I checked reservation online. Speedy refund after contacting reservations. 787 also changed to 330 with the dreaded angled seat. LHR-DOH leg now changed again this time 340 angled seat. Resigned to the fact won't be getting much sleep. Never had problems with Qatar in the past. If I had known 340/330 combo with no flat bed would have booked SQ. My scoring is based on past experiences on 777 only not the older 340 330.

When fillet finally arrived it was tough and chewy and I couldnt eat. I couldnt even cut through. My Inflight Entertainment on one leg was not working. The movies are very old and very few new shows. The staff although very pleasant do not seem to be that helpful. The seats were very comfortable. I had to ask for pyjamas and no-one offered to put my fitted cover over seat. Good quality champagne what a waste. Overall very disappointing.

Although the plane was 11 years old it was new and clean inside. New touchscreen entertainment system many new films and a wide choices of films. Food was excellent however the cabin crew should smile more. DOH-LHR: A 7year old B777-300ER. Flight was delayed by about 30 minutes. Entertainment system was almost the same but it wasn't sensitive. Meal was not bad but the first sector was better. Excellent service the cabin crew smiled a lot. MAD-DOH: A 4 year old B777-300ER. Entertainment system was more sensitive. Excellent service and meal. Seat was comfortable and the legroom is good. Qatar Airways is my first choice when I go to Europe next time because of its 5 star service!

Put on the following day's flight and overnight in a hotel in Doha at no additional cost. Doha's new airport is stunning.

Flights out were on new planes and very comfortable however cabin crew were tiring always fussing; maybe that's 5 star treatment but I don't like it. Flight back was on a not so new plane from Doha to London and not very comfortable I'll stick with BA premium economy out and business back in the future as its cheaper and all in a better experience. My colleague went Emirates business for around the same price as Qatar Airways and reported a very good experience.

For most of the sectors Boeing 787-8 Jet and Boeing 777-300ER Jet were used. Those were superb flights with amazing facilities except QR 0660. Crew and flight attendants also were fairly good. Flight QR0660. It was like an old bus there was no AC when we were on board. One hour was taken to fix the AC. This flight must not be used for international service it should be used for domestic service. I started from North America via Europe Middle East to South Asia. We expect comfortable service throughout all sectors.

IFE system worked properly and crew was welcoming but not very friendly just did their job. Special ordered meals were served but drinks were only served twice! Flight was on time. Second leg QR67 DOH-FRA on Airbus A330-300. Staff was welcoming and helpful. IFE did not work properly (crashed several times). Ordered meals were served but tasted horrible. Moreover the amount was much to less. Again drinks were only served twice (during breakfast and lunch). I felt a bit ignored by the crew when I wanted a third drink which in my opinion should be served on a flight of seven hours. Flight arrived on time in Frankfurt.

New 787 to Doha and found it very comfortable good leg room quiet and spacious overall. Older 340 to London but again comfortable and spacious. Easy transfer at Doha in the new airport.

The seat quality was one of the best I have had. The biggest let down for me and why I will not be using Qatar again was because I am an emerald one world flyer I was greeted by a member of the cabin crew who took my meal order only to find when the meals were served I was asked again as my preference was no longer available. I explained I had made a previous order being an emerald member. This was also the case for the fast track lanes at passport control no fast track passes handed out which it states in the one world privileges. Doha airport is so much improved easy connections and very clean and professional.

T Berri",,11th August 2014,,Business Class,,,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,8,MXP-DOH (A320 business): Flew the refurbished A320 with the new flat-seat beds. Very comfortable to sleep on but the overall lack of space (as this is a narrow-bodied plane) makes you feel very close to your neighbours on either side. Service was rather disorganised with crew going back and forth constantly. Flight attendants were not rude but tended to be mechanical - this was a general impression I had on my other flights with Qatar. DOH- SIN-DOH (787 business): Amazing plane. Occupancy was low for this sector making an already spacious cabin seem more spacious with the seats very private. Lots of space for storage and seat was great for sleeping. Crew this time was better professional but not friendly apart from the cabin director who seemed genuine in welcoming people aboard. This is probably my favourite plane so far (better than the A380). DOH-MXP (A330): old plane with average seats (inclined flat seats not very comfortable for sleeping) washrooms were not very clean - the worst leg of the entire journey. The 'highlight' of this flight was excellent service from one Thai flight attendant: helpful and friendly. Overall: I found Qatar to be a well-priced airline offering good competent service. Food was above average (better than BA worse than SQ/Emirates) but portions were small (and I'm not a big eater). In- flight entertainment was a bit limited and the touch-screen controls were not the most intuitive and responsive. Plus with Qatar part of the Oneworld alliance - there are more opportunities to accrue points. Downsides: the shared Sala Montale lounge at Malpensa is depressing. Furnished well but lacking in refreshment offerings; delays for transfers at DOH. Still will probably fly Qatar again if the opportunity arises.

Khan Munawar",,8th August 2014,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,Flew 2 sectors: Islamabad - Doha QR615 Doha - Manchester QR23. 1st sector on 773 - very clean and well maintained cabin excellent IFE and very welcoming and attentive cabin staff flight very smooth and superb landing at Doha. 2nd sector operated by A333 aircraft cabin clean and well maintained - comfort levels very good for a ~9 year old aircraft A7-EAH IFE acceptable needs upgrading. flight was smooth from take off on schedule to a normal landing before time. Arrival at gate was delayed by ~ 30 min for no fault of the airline rather due to a 'hoax' which was dealt with in an excellent manner by the authorities and exceptional professionalism demonstrated by the flight crew as well as the cabin crew. Only drawback was that the breakfast served on both sectors though well prepared was exactly the same.

Alex Griggs",,6th August 2014,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,,3,no,4,Flew LHR-DOH-RGN HND-DOH-LHR. The LHR-DOH was on a refurbished A330 so the flight was pleasant with a good sized IFE screen and a sufficient selection of films. However the letdown on this flight was the catering which was a running theme throughout all of the flights as well as the attitude of the cabin crew who looked as if they did not want to work. The DOH-RGN flight was good on the small A319 which only had 60 Passengers on board this helped as it meant the crew were more attentive. For the return we tried to upgrade at the Tokyo office offering to pay however we were told that because the DOH-LHR leg was full we could not even pay for the HND-DOH leg meaning the flight would have empty business class seats. The flight however from HND-DOH was very nice as the Tokyo office sent a message to check in stating that we would like extra legroom seats which was a nice touch. The DOH-LHR flight on the other hand was terrible a downgrade from the A380 to the A340 meant that the flight was totally full and the plane was showing its age with broken seats and dirty toilets. The crew also didn't help the flight by not smiling and ignoring the call button for passengers. All in all I was dissatisfied with Qatar Airways.

A Althani",,3rd August 2014,,First Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,DOH-JED-DOH. Qatar Airways offers a Business Class layout as First Class on this route we flew out on a 777 and returned on their new 787-8 a first time for me on the Dreamliner personally I would call my review a mixed review. No one can fault Qatar Airways class of service they are top notch from the moment you enter into the airport to the moment you pick up your luggage and head home my only draw back is surprise surprise the Dreamliner. The way the layout is you always get distracted by the TV screens of other passengers you cannot concentrate on your reading nor can you watch something peacefully. There is plenty of storage room on the seat but the operating system of the entertainment is a little complicated. I hope that Qatar Airways review the layout of their new A350.

Y Areemitr",,3rd August 2014,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,,2,no,4,LHR-DOH-BKK and back. All sectors operated by B777-300ER except DOH-LHR which was an A340 (old plane and really showed its age). QR have serious communication issues when it comes to being delayed and all flights (except the one leaving BKK) were delayed by at least 40 minutes if not more. Hamad international airport was nice and new but unfortunately very chaotic if you have a tight connection. Food was probably the best thing on QR - quite tasty for airline food! FA's really varied on each leg - some were just sitting/standing around chatting amongst themselves and were clearly not interested in customer service whereas others tried their best to deliver. Inflight entertainment was pretty good on 777s. Plenty to choose from but pretty much the same film/TV choices a month later and remote control on A340 stiff and unresponsive. Seats were a little on the uncomfortable side though lots of legroom compared to other carriers. The 2-4-2 config on the A340 definitely suited my companion and I more than the 777's 3-3-3 layout. Overall pretty average.

The first leg of the journey on QR905 was relatively OK but on arriving at Doha with a 2 hour wait for my next flight I went to the business class lounge where I was abruptly turned away as apparently there was no room left. I was left unable to shower or purchase any refreshment and had no option but to wait at the gate for my flight. The flight was delayed due to waiting for other passengers which resulted in a very unpleasant time sat on the aircraft. The service on board was OK but the toilets were not cleaned. My monitor kept sticking and despite being reset would not function properly. I feel very aggrieved that I paid for a business class flight and received economy treatment - I have yet to receive a response to my email from Qatar Airways.

K Chhan",,31st July 2014,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,,,5,yes,6,"My family and I flew PNH-Manchester then CDG-PNH both with technical stops in HCM and transit in DOH. Generally speaking the inflight service was good but the food on all 4 sectors was bad. Passengers on all 4 flights were mostly Westerners and Westernised Asians like my family and yet the food was quite Indian Middle-eastern - oriented relatively spicy. I know that one should not expect too much from airline food but having flown on many airlines around the world I expected more from an airline that positions itself as ""the 5-star airline"". Likewise it's a shame that Qatar has just inaugurated a state-of-the art airport in DOH but Qatar Airways ground staff in DOH failed to implement universal policies that are clearly advertised in their Website e.g. to give priority boarding to passengers accompanied by young children."

Louise De Villiers",,29th July 2014,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,,5,yes,7,Three of us flew between Cape Town and Casablanca via Doha in July 2014. The ticket price was very good. The leg from Cape Town and Doha on a new Boeing Dreamliner was excellent. The airport in Doha is brand new and there are excellent facilities for transit passengers. The flight from Doha to Casablanca was problematic. There was a 3.5 hour delay due to a faulty AV system on a rather old Airbus aircraft and the passengers had to endure a fair amount of discomfort as a result of this. The return flight from Doha to Cape Town on the Dreamliner was also delayed due to late arrival of the incoming aircraft and an electrical problem on the aircraft. The latter surfaced when the aircraft dropped passengers off in Johannesburg and had to depart to Cape Town. The food was average. Especially the light snacks were unsatisfactory. The crew members were very helpful and professional.

Last week I took Qatar Airways for the first time Madrid to Bangkok via Doha. The experience was the best business class experience I have had. The seats are very comfortable and the space between seats the largest I have seen in a business class cabin. It is true that the layout does not give you much privacy if you are traveling alone. The service and the food were excellent especially on the Doha to Bangkok flight. The only downturn was the Doha airport lounges were not available. We were given 300 Qr vouchers for food and shopping which was quite nice. Overall excellent experience."

Firstly the positives both flights were fine although at Doha on the BKK sector flight we waited on the aircraft for more than an hour without the APU running so very hot. HBE to DOHA half empty DOHA to BKK very full. There were lots of free upgrades in Business can tell by the yellow luggage tag. Qatar should vet upgrades carefully as these people walked around without shoes and were generally noisy. Doha Lounges are a total mess that is an understatement. No room poor food service very poor. No pre boarding for Business class just get with the rest attitude. I would not use Qatar again until they sort out the new airport.

QR837 BKK-DOH overnight. Business cabin half full yet call button repeatedly went unanswered. FA screwed up my breakfast (so I got none). Flat bed seat seemed to curve downward at both ends and had lots of hard metalic edges which required an additional blanket to soften. Meals were minuscule. I understand small portions on an overnight flight but if you are hungry you are out of luck. I'd heard so much about the fabulous first and business class lounge in DOH. I must be in the wrong place (even though I have been told by two staff that this is the only QR lounge in the airport). What a disappointment. No particularly comfortable seating very little privacy meagre drink and food offerings no organized system for getting a shower - seems to be catch-as-catch- can. I wonder if their famous premier lounge I'd heard so much about is under renovation or something. I expected much more than this.

First the flights between HYD-DOH are single aisle on A321 feels cramped IFE is just passable but food was a big let down. We arrived at the brand new Hamad International airport so the airport experience was excellent although very quiet. On flights between DOH and LHR (on A340-600) and FCO-DOH (on A330-300) there was a problem with the air conditioning at DOH so it was like an oven until the flight took off to LHR. In FCO the flight was parked in the middle of nowhere so the boarding experience was terrible. IFE was a shocker - no touchscreens and an inspiring collection of movies and shows. The food was terrible. On the bright side cabin crew were friendly the seat configuration and space factor was really comfortable. Again on the down side: no mood lighting no hot towel no menu card and plastic spoons and forks is not what I expect from a five-star airline.

H Zhang",,20th July 2014,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,I flew from London Heathrow to Guangzhou Baiyun. The trip was the best economy class long-haul flight I have had. Starting from check in I checked in online the night before my trip. At the airport the ground staff who checked me in were very friendly. Because I had a short transfer flight to catch 1.5 hours after handing in Doha they put a label of rapid transfer on my checked in luggage. The first flight from Heathrow to Doha only 30% of the economy class were seated and basically every passenger had a row to lie down. The dining service was great cabin crews were extremely nice even though you ask them to get you another drink several times they didn't have any printed forms of menu they present you a menu on your personal IFE screen. The flight to Guangzhou was pretty much the same but with less choice of food and more crowded.

Gordon S McDougall",,13th July 2014,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,7,As frequent flyer from Azerbaijan to SE Asia and Australasia over the last 15 years I'm delighted that Qatar now fly from Baku cutting out the change in carriers. Lounges: Very poor. GYD DOH and BKK are not pleasant. Emirates leave you so far behind in pre-flight care. Boarding: At both GYD and DOH when flying to GYD it is a scrum. No pre-boarding for BC and very little interest in premium passengers until we're onboard. I pay a lot of money for my flights and I expect a little bit more than QR provide here. Inflight: Staff are great service excellent movies and videos don't change often enough and food is a big problem. Many customers have been traveling for a long time before the airport and when you put us in a lounge where the snacks/food is atrocious we are looking to be fed onboard. To wait six hours for a breakfast is ridiculous given that you only provide a snack after boarding. All in all not bad but some of your rivals really are so much better in many aspects. At least you provide genuine BC seats in the short haul sectors unlike some other carriers. If Emirates started flying into GYD tomorrow you'd lose me and most of my fellow passengers.

S McNeill",,13th July 2014,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,no,1,I booked six Qatar Airways flights which were from London to Bahrain via Doha. In general I have no adverse comments to make about the economy service and the crew have always been pleasant. In fact the economy service is better with Qatar than a lot of other carriers. However it has been a nightmare on all but one flight with the air conditioning not working on the ground during boarding either in London Doha or Bahrain. As boarding takes a long time the temperature in the cabin reaches a very high temperature due to the confined space and the amount of people on board. Then the crew close the doors and still there is no air con switched on. We taxi out and now there is minimum air coming through but the air is hot not cold. When I have asked the cabin crew what is happening on these flights they always say the same thing - it is like this on all our flights and the cabin won't get cool until we have taken off. Such a shame because their economy service is good.

QR lounge for Glad and Silver transit passengers in Economy still not available but this glitch has been compensated with 5.000 Qmiles and a $30 gift voucher.

Charles Kennedy",,6th July 2014,,Business Class,,,1.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,,,3,yes,5,LHR-DOH-NBO. First leg was in business disappointed to find Qatar are still using angled lie-flat seats in business class a curse I thought has lifted from all decent airlines. It is probably easier for a customer to learn to fly than it is to find a comfortable sleeping position in these things. Another gripe the entertainment system wasn't working at all. I was happy to read but another very basic omission from an airline that promises so much. Finally despite the potential of an a la carte menu which most airlines only offer in F class (if ever) the food was completely without any flavour at all. On the other hand the fish may have been bland but the cabin crew were the catch of the day not only kind and helpful but also intelligent and articulate. Transit at the new Doha airport was easy and the building itself is stylish and functional - can't wait to come back. Finally the flight to Nairobi in economy on an A320 was great three choices of food (my vegetarian curry was very tasty) and working IFE meant I could finally catch up on two movies I hadn't been able to enjoy on the first leg. Both flights on time.

I am die hard Boeing individual but the 4+ hours on this airbus were great due to the comfortable seat great service and absolutely seamless experience flying Qatar was in this segment. From DOH to JFK I was on a 777-300. Honestly every star given to this airline is clearly deserved. Staff are professional. Great entertainment (but now even horrible American carriers have it) and yes kudos on the right temperature of food and champagne (concept foreign to all American carriers).

Jose Montoya",,3rd July 2014,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,QR702 JFK-DOH. Impeccable experience from comfortable seat to the most professional service in the air I have experienced. (Yes included the usual suspects: Emirates Etihad Cathay. I have never flown Singapore or Asiana but all American and all European). I cannot imagine myself flying some else when traveling to the ME and beyond.

SzeKer Chew",,3rd July 2014,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Pleasant trip for both outgoing (KUL-DOH-MAN) and incoming trip (LHR-DOH-KUL). For outgoing trip it was a red- eye flight at 3.30 am QR 851 (KUL-DOH) Airbus 330-200 with USB port near the arm rest. The journey was smooth without any turbulence. Two nice meals were served - snack was served once onboard and breakfast was served before landing. A small pouch was given to all passengers which include eye mask etc. IFE was nice with touchscreen features and plenty of movies and songs. The transfer at Doha New Airport was a breeze although I needed to walk quite a long way from the landing gate to the transfer screening. Next flight would be QR 23 (DOH- MAN) Airbus 330-300 without USB port. This aircraft looked a bit old but the seat pitch was much better than the previous one. IFE was nice without touchscreen features. Two meals were served - breakfast was served once onboard and snack was served before landing. For incoming trip QR 004 (LHR- DOH) at 1505 Boeing 777-300ER with USB port. Two nice meals were served - lunch was served once onboard and snack was served before landing. IFE was nice with touchscreen features and plenty of movies and songs. The seat pitch is good. Next flight would be QR 848 (DOH - KUL) at 115 Airbus 330-200 with USB port. IFE was nice with touchscreen features. Two meals were served - snack was served once onboard and lunch was served before landing. For all flights beverages were offered a few times along the journey. The cabin crews were very attentive whenever there was a request from the passengers. They would do their best to fulfil the request and they eventually did most of the time. I will go for Qatar Airways again!

After reading many less favourable reviews on Qatar Airways we feared the trip when we were delayed at Cape Town before even embarking. However a pleasant crew outstanding service a well maintained Boeing 787 an on time landing in Doha changed our views. The transfer was quick and easy and the onward flight to Barcelona as good as the first. We will follow the route again!

The first plane was an Airbus 330 with Lie flat seats. The service was fantastic! The seats were extremely comfortable the monitor was quite large. Everything about this flight was wonderful. Next segment was on a B777-300 and the seats had even more room! Fantastic lie flat beds excellent service. They don't feed you like they used to but the meals were fine service was very good. I would highly recommend this airline and service. You had tons of movies to choose from that were all recent releases as well as some older ones. The inflight entertainment system was very good. The monitors were at least 16”. They offered me pyjamas on the second leg to change into they provided very nice pillows and blankets on both flights as well as a nice amenity kit.

M Aplas",,1st July 2014,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,,5,yes,6,13/14 June 2014. CPT-DOH-LCA. First flight (CPT-DOH) on a new 787 I was very excited for my first flight on a Dreamliner but was rather disappointed by the poor seat pitch and width being 1.9m tall (6'2) I was very uncomfortable and unable to sleep the whole way. The movie choices were also disappointed being very old and not updated to the current months entertainment suite. Food was very good cabin crew were sweet but seemed extremely flustered. Second flight (DOH-LCA) on an old A320. First thing I noticed was there was no inflight entertainment which was very sad however it was a shortish flight so not a big issue. For the most part cabin crew were very nice except one lady who was rather obnoxious and put a sour taste in my mouth for the rest of the journey. Luckily flight was only half full so I had an entire row to myself. Extremely good fare on entire trip.

Appeared to be a very old plane seats were hardly much better than economy hardly any foot room I am rather a large person (which is why I chose Business class) but the seat belt didn't fit table wouldn't come down across my stomach TV was too uncomfortable to watch and anyway my earphones didn't work (seat 1A) so very glad it was only a 4 hour 50 minute flight. I couldn't eat anything as the table was too uncomfortable. The Flight crew were very pleasant though so pleased I was transferring to a 777 at Doha I couldn't have stood being in that plane for any longer. The onward flight to Melbourne was amazing and would recommend Qatar for Doha/Melbourne leg (unlucky I got that aircraft I guess).

The first leg was First class on an Airbus 321. Small aircraft and got shaken a round a bit during fine weather. The service was outstanding. Only 2 people and a family. The cabin supervisor went out of his way to please us. No Alcohol on the first leg. The second leg fro Doha to Bangkok was again exceptional service. The food was hot of and extremely high quality by any restaurant standard yet alone up in the air at 39000 feet! The cabin staff were pleasant always had a smile and nothing was too much trouble. Both the supervisors and staff on both legs should be commended for their efforts. The new airport was a pleasant surprise with no buses. No problems accessing the premium lounge Plenty of drink and food available even though it was a little bit busy. Be prepared to walk a long way to get there and to the gate. However they give you plenty of warning when you are due to board. They scan all passengers in the lounge. You should not be overlooked. Best of all was the smoking lounge where in this politically correct world we live in was a bonus. It is isolated so those of us who wish to smoke can do so in peace. Hats off to the entire experience. I will choose no other airline if it flies the route I am taking. The new airport is big and will take some getting used to.

D Upton",,23rd June 2014,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,no,7,A real mixed bag - some staff friendly and courteous with good English language skills and some staff having none of the three and being flat out rude. Most planes do not have enough toilets on board with long queues being common. Food standard quite decent for a plane but drinks service is not nearly frequent enough. I waited two hours during a flight for someone to come past with the little drinks tray that they usually provide and in the end had to push the call button to get a drink! It took them 10 minutes from the button being pushed to arrive. The amenities kit is excellent with the ear plugs being a rare and thoughtful addition. Not sure I would fly again not with so many other options available for similar money.

All on 777 apart from Barcelona-Doha on 330. 777 comfortable and great seat pitch. 330 comfortable but entertainment remote in awkward position in armrest. Flights on time. Crew generally very pleasant and reasonably efficient. Food from Perth to Doha lovely. Then breakfast on arrival and departure from Doha which were fine but nothing special. Food on both return flights really not good didn't eat much of it which is not like me! Strangely didn't mind the old airport too much this time despite the long bus trips. Returned through the new Hamad airport which seems like a big improvement especially the aerobridges but didn't really feel fully finished seemed like half of the lights still weren't functioning yet. Overall a reasonably pleasant trip especially given the good price we got the tickets for.

Anders Pedersen",,16th June 2014,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,SGN-DOH-NBO on 14 June 2014. Metal was A330-200 and A320 respectively. Both flights on time. Lounge access granted in SGN and DOH due to my status card to the airline. Got the seat I wanted and when on board I got assistance by FA to remove intruders encroaching my row. Opportunity to flat out on both sectors. A dinner served after midnight was of poor quality (warm snack) but edible. Champagne offered in economy class upon request. Staff alert and welcoming. New airport in Hamad Doha is still a mess too many staff that don't know how to help lots of bottlenecks too few toilets too few lounges (many pax denied access due to fully crowded lounges). Those denied were given “gift-vouchers” which force them to queue up for long time to actually get them. Many regional flights and “small destinations like NBO are still not accessed directly by gates but require the usual awful humiliating imprisoning bus-rides. QR are still delivering FA and ground staff are world class. However the food quality is sliding a bit and the concept on board could need some refreshing. No choice on beers. Wines are acceptable and provide 4 choices plus champagne on some sectors.

Lam Kok Wai",,13th June 2014,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,Six of us took the segment from Singapore to Doha followed by Doha to Sao Paulo. The 787 that flew us from Singapore to Doha was brand new and very comfortable. The long flight from Doha to Sao Paulo was comfortable too. The flight didn't feel long as we were sleeping quite comfortably and there were lots of TV programs/movies to tie us through. Much more comfortable than we thought. Both flights have USB charging point so you can charge phones/laptops. Crews were friendly. The seat that I was on (Doha-Sao Paulo) had faulty inclination though it couldn't sit straight. Would be good if such defects were rectified prior to the long flight as I could not sit upright during take off and the stewardess thought that I didn't follow the instruction.

Al-Ani Ayad",,12th June 2014,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,,1,no,4,Degrading the Business Class experience at the new airport in Doha and Business Class passengers will no longer have automatic access to lounges at departure and transfer - I know of no other airline doing this. Under the old regime Business Class passengers regardless of their loyalty status benefited from a separate terminal that provided a very good seating area separate check in and boarding facilities. At the new airport this is currently not available and no lounge access to all Business Class passengers. Lounge is only accessible if you are a gold or silver card holder even if you paid a full price business class ticket. They indicated however that you would be able to access the lounge by the way of paying an extra fee! Flight experience on the other hand was fine. Crew is very good. Entertainment systems breaks down and needs to be restarted. New seats are very good too.

M Sidhu",,10th June 2014,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,,3,no,4,QR006 from London to Doha then onward to Amritsar (India). Flight from Heathrow was poor. An old airbus A330-200. The seat pitch was bad. Not comfortable. The IFE was ancient. The control was fixed in the arm rest so navigation was hard and you had to press it hard a few times in order for it to function. The Hollywood selection was good but the world cinema choices were poor. The food was exactly the same as I had 2 years before on the very same flight. It was tasteless. The crew were good just did what they had to. The flight from Doha to Amritsar was much better on a new Airbus A321. IFE was faster and easier to use but same movies. Arrived on time in India. On the return the flight was overbooked at Amritsar and after much confusion was put on Air India which was surprisingly better than Qatar Airways.

Pre takeoff drinks supplied during flight Perth sector crew executed duties well although robotic and little interaction with pax until a smile before landing at Doha. Food was good wine list selection excellent and well presented. On landing at Hamad international what a disappointment after all the delays in the opening of facility. Doha to Madrid what a difference in the crew the service was excellent as the first leg but much sharper and the interaction by the crew with the pax was excellent. Coming from a hospitality background I would want this crew working for me menu choices good and wine list choices good our thanks to the crew for making this sector a very pleasant experience.

P Martin",,8th June 2014,,Business Class,,,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,7,Singapore-Athens via Doha return. Mix of aircraft 777-300er and A330-200 outbound returning on A320 and 787. Night flight out of SIN so slept most of the way. Morning flight to Athens. Not a fan of the old A330 seat but overall no major issues. Return journey was evening departure from Athens on the 320. More like a regional biz seat and feels a little cramped. Seems to be too smaller plane for a 5 hour sector IMO. This was followed by the 787 which is fantastic in every sense. Again a night flight - Slept very well and look forward to being on this plane again in the summer. New airport both ways - Will be a big improvement when ready but why it has opened with 1 pathetic lounge I really don't understand. I travelled with a colleague who was flying Qatar for the first time I doubt he will fly them again because of the airport experience. Really was a major let down.

H Kariyawasam",,8th June 2014,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,,,3,no,4,LHR-CMB-LHR. All flights (4 sectors) delayed. Ran for first connection and made it. Return got to gate and aircraft still boarding but told I was disconnected as baggage would not make it. 6 hour wait as next LHR flight also delayed. Connection time was 50 minutes on ticket yet told unless 40 minutes free cannot make connection. Why sell a ticket leaving a 10 minute space to make a connection. New airport too big and had to run 1/2 mile at least to get to next flight. Rude ground staff who have no idea how the new terminal works. On board no printed menu menu on screen not available for 4 flights taken small portions of food and plastic cutlery paper cups no wow factor in any way. Cabin crew polite and did try and entertainment good. cloth hot towels no overnight shades/toothbrush. I will not fly this airline again.

Seat configuration is different but good on both - flat beds but more space on the 787. Both flights were delayed in departure - not so impressive. But the big letdown was the food! IT was (apart from KLM business) the worst business class food I have ever had! Stodgy unimaginative and dull. Service was odd - my post take-off drink was forgotten despite being written down and staff were surly and sullen.

Surprisingly fabulous hotel with great food added to our travel experience and even motivated plans to incorporate a visit to Doha which we had no idea was so beautiful on future travels.

Derek Gilboe",,2nd June 2014,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,2,yes,2,Qatar Airways provides commendable in-flight services particularly in their business/first cabins. The flight crews are always focused on service doing their utmost to ensure passenger comfort. Highlights of the airline are the newer aircraft and a strong focus on the aircraft interiors that maximize passenger comfort particularly the large overhead bins on their Boeing aircraft and newer Airbus fleet additions. Food on the flights in business is excellent with choices for breakfast indulgence (snack) and main meals with a broad selection of wines. Equally nice are the sleepwear provided on longer flights with the extra padding in the sleep covers for the business/first seats. While the in-flight experience is excellent the airline is facing challenges with the terminal and transit experience. Outside of Doha lounges were very limited although joining OneWorld has opened up many new lounges suitable for premium customers; unfortunately they face ground staff issues at several airports that frustrate during the boarding and deplaning process. The new airport in Doha their primary hub is open but facing considerable growing pains and still relies on buses for many airport transits. Coupled with insufficient lounge space particularly for their premium customers significantly compromises the overall trip experience and turns their new flagship airport in Doha to a frustrating experience that undermines the excellent in-flight service and value for the money in the competitive market of air travel.

I was in row 8 so had a nice amount of leg room. IFE was a little unresponsive but since the flights were short it wasn't a problem. Food was up to the usual QR standard and cabin crew were friendly and professional as usual. Second leg was an A333. had an aisle seat so leg space was restricted due to the IFE box under the seat in front. IFE kept sticking but since it was a night flight I slept most of the journey. Crew were friendly and professional as the usual standard. Catering was just OK on this leg. The new airport makes transiting a breeze.

At the check-in we got the information that we can't access the lounge at the new Doha airport. For this reason we got a voucher which could be changed into vouchers at Doha airport. The flight from Zurich to Doha was one hour delayed. We didn't get any proper information. The departure time was shifted every 15 minutes. Once on board was surprised about the comfort in the cabin. The food and drinks were excellent. The service onboard was average. At Doha airport they were not really ready. Very long queue at the security check. Asked for business class fast track. Was not available. Then had to walk quite a long way for the connecting gate. We were flying from gate B1A. That meant we had to take a bus to the plane but first we had to wait outside for the bus. Once at the plane we had to wait outside again before we could enter. Flight was ok. Food again excellent and the service was better than from Zurich to Doha.

Thomas Reeh",,2nd June 2014,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,On 4th May I flew from Melbourne to Manchester via Doha with Qatar Airways. Qatar Airways is affiliated with One World so lounge access is provided at Melbourne Airport by Qantas always a good way to start a long journey. The plane for the first sector was a brand new Boeing 777 and on a full flight I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of room in economy. I am 6ft 3in (189cms) and I could stretch out quite comfortably without touching the seat in front. I was sat in 23K. In flight entertainment was excellent with Premiere release movies and a host of documentaries to help while the hours away (all 14 hrs and 15 minutes for the first sector). Service and inflight catering was excellent with a good choice of food and regular water runs by the cabin crew. Landing in Doha was probably the only negative as the airport was packed and hectic. With a tight transit time of just 60 minutes I was fearing the worst but somehow it all seemed to happen and I made the connection. The second sector of 7hrs and 30 minutes was completed in an Airbus A330 which was notably smaller and older than the Boeing 777. However the service was on par and food and entertainment options again superior. All in all a pleasant experience for what is a gruelling distance to fly. Qatar Airways deserve the recognition and commendations they win on a regular basis. Highly recommended.

First class lounge at Heathrow Terminal was fantastic fabulous good great wines and nice staff. Onboard the airplane brilliant business class cabin and nice color scheme. I had a single window seats and truly private - better than most airlines first class. Meals served individually table style and food was good with a great selection of wines. Staff very efficient they don't smile much though but are courteous. The in flight entertainment had massive choice of movies and tv programs. Downside was arrival into Doha with long bus ride but the new airport is flagged to open this week and that will top this off as the best business class out there.

When we arrived in Philadelphia we needed new boarding passes so went to the Qatar Airways counter for them. The attendant said that there was something wrong with our ticket boarding passes cannot be issued and only US Airways can fix the problem. She sent us to the US Airways counter without telling us what was the issue. We went over stood in line for 45 minutes waited for someone. Of course nothing was wrong. We went back to Qatar Airways for sure the issue had cleared and we were all set to board. We wasted over 90 minutes for no apparent reason. Philadelphia to Doha was delayed severely due to a bathroom issue. Doha Airport itself was small and messy with the new Hamad Airport opening 27 May it will probably get better. HKG-DOH with Cathay Pacific we were upgraded to Premium Economy free due to overbooking. The seat was very comfortable. The in flight entertainment system was more responsive compared to Qatar Airways. DOH-PHL I slept through most of the flight and my husband most of the flight. I don't recommend this airline unless you are flying business or first class where Qatar Airways actually value you.

Things will improve with the new airport opening 27th May 2014. The pilot did apologize and water was passed around but it was very hot. It is hardly becoming a 5* airline to operate aircraft with defects that impact on passenger comfort. The system did not work for the safety video and a manual demonstration was provided which appeared hurried and rather perfunctory. Missed connections at DOH for myself and others and the horror of the Doha Airport transfer desk. Only the attendants on the first leg welcomed me onboard as a Gold Card holder.

The flight was OK food was enjoyable but the list of inflight movies where old and not that many. All announcements where done in both English and Arabic which get annoying especially the videos of the same safety procedures interrupting the in-flight entertainment. All flights were delayed some by over 1 hour which does not help with tight connections. Missed our flight from Berlin to Dusseldorf for which they took over an hour to get us on the next flight which we almost missed again. Lost our luggage as well at least it turned up the next day. Our return flights were also delayed. It may have been cheaper but Singapore Air does it best. Also Doha airport is not great at all.

There was no initiative shown by the cabin crew no greetings upon boarding or as the meal was served no offer of newspapers or selection of reading materials service was inconsistent with the crew (with the exception of the inflight supervisor) unwilling to engage in conversation. I mentioned being hungry at 11pm for a 8.30pm flight departure and was rudely told the Captain had the seatbelt sign on. Dinner was finally served at 11.45pm. The plate service does not work as between the first pax being served and the last could take as long as an hour!! Too much time spent in the galley and not enough walking the aisle. Food was good but not fantastic. The inflight entertainment offered all the choices to be expected but the navigation was a little ungainly with the mouse like cursor. The seat was similar to other airlines offering a full flat product. Happy to note that Qatar still provided pyjamas and a small overnight bag which many other airlines have discontinued. Overall my disappointment with the cabin service overwhelms what positives I obtained from a good lounge in Doha and efficient check in service.

Anders Pedersen",,23rd May 2014,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,NBO-DOH-BUD on 19 May 2014. All flights on time. Check-in was done well - I had two tickets and 4 sectors in front of me – only the first 2 sectors were with Qatar Airways but they managed to issue all 4 boarding cards thus the last two sectors were with Turkish who are in Star-alliance. Also the luggage was checked through beyond Budapest –- a nice touch. First leg on A320 night flight load only 60% - thus offered 3 seats in a row. Nice touch is that they offered 3 options of dinners (instead of breakfast) thus the clock was 2 am. I had red-marinated sea-bass as 1st main-course and as there were plenty of food left as many were sleeping I had rice and chicken as a 2nd main-course. Staff were proactive and I was greeted by name again by at least 4 FAs. Wines in mini-bottles and of reasonable quality. DOH-BUD A321. Flight full except 1 seat next to me. I was greeted and respected as Privilege Club Gold Card holder. Morning flight with 3 options of hot food. I chose the vegetarian omelette. Champagne Jacquart upon request. Juices and coffee ad libitum. I was explained by the chief purser on QRs new booking system which make it possible to combine tickets and transfer luggage across airlines many sectors and different alliances. IFE good though my monitor froze an hour before landing.

U Colombo",,18th May 2014,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,7,CPT-DOH-MXP-DOH-CPT. Big surprise was QR122 MXP-DOH on A320-200 aircraft where the old uncomfortable seat have been replaced with lie-flat ones! Well done Qatar Airways being a six hours night flight it made a difference. DOH-CPT on new Boeing Dreamliner was a good one. Pity a technical glitch kept us on the tarmac in Johannesburg for an extra three hours with little said from the captain. Overall a positive experience with a competent and professional cabin crew.

Khan Muhammad",,12th May 2014,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,I flew on a connection from JFK-FCO-DOH-LHE. The ticket was a combination of Alitalia and Qatar. Excellent flight from JFK with Alitalia very impressed with their new business class. Of course when I arrived in Rome it was the traditional European lounge which was decent for a 3 hour layover. I have been flying Qatar for the past 6 years now. As soon as the flight was announced for boarding I didn't pay attention at that time Qatar airways ground staff came and assisted me to the aircraft with a very friendly attitude. The moment I entered the cabin they knew who I was and escorted me to my seat. The cabin manager then came introduced herself to me and thanked me for being their loyal Qatar Airways member. Throughout the flight the cabin crew were very friendly. 7 hours journey great food great hospitality. Landed at Doha Airport again separate terminals for First and Bus class passengers was treated very well and acknowledged by everyone for my membership status. Took a shower in the lounge and 2 hours later boarded for LHE. Again great service till LHE and enjoyed every minute of my flight. Etihad and Emirates should learn from Qatar Airways. Looking forward to their new Airport soon.

Zelda Gilpin",,12th May 2014,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,I flew 4 long flights with Qatar Airways. Their staff are friendly and helpful. The seats are comfortable and have enough leg-room. The food was tasty and more than enough. The entertainment on board is some of the best. Even the help at the airport was great we never worried about getting to the right place. Qatar even booked a hotel room for us at a 5 star hotel at no extra cost as we had a long stop-over in Doha. This was really great as we could have a shower to freshen up and have a quick rest in a comfortable bed. I will recommend Qatar Airways to anyone.

T Vernet",,11th May 2014,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,CDG-DOH-NRT return. Y class. QR deserves its five stars. FAs were always smiling very helpful and some of them truly friendly. Extra drinks I ordered were never forgotten. Food was above average for Y class. IFE is excellent with dozens of films and lots of languages to choose from. But I was most of all impressed by the DOH-NRT flights on B777-200: the planes were brand new seats very comfortable with good legroom the cabin is small and stylish for Y IFE perfect food very tasty from NRT and the crew largely Japanese were fantastic as well as the ground staff at NRT. Without doubt the best Y flight I made in many years. On the downside A340 were ageing organisation of meals was often weird (too short or kept for too long) temperature in the cabin was curiously always badly managed (too hot or too cold) and most of all Doha's airport is awfully crowed and dull. New airport will be a major improvement.

L De los Reyes",,11th May 2014,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,3,Flew from Doha - Hong Kong via airbus A330. I will definitely try to avoid this aircraft of Qatar the aircraft was an old one based on the looks and the seat was really uncomfortable. I sat on the pillow and blanket just to make it feel better. The inflight entertainment isn't as entertaining as before.

P Mercer",,11th May 2014,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,3,no,4,LHR-DOH-BKK-DOH-LHR. On the first flight there was a family consisting of husband wife and children all in business but with a number of maids and a baby in economy. During the flight the maids were constantly coming into the business section and squeezing between the seats and using the toilets. When I asked the cabin manager whether it was Qatar Airways’ policy to allow economy passengers to walk around the business cabin he said it was not but this particular passenger was listed on the manifest as a ‘VVIP’ which meant they could do nothing about it. At one level it was an excellent experience – the quality of the food in both the lounges (LHR and DOH) and on the aircraft was remarkable and the cabin crew were consistently friendly responsive and effective. The Boeing 777 seats were comfortable and the IFE varied and stimulating. All of the aircraft were clean and although one of them was getting old there were no signs of wear. Qatar Airways wants to sell itself as the ‘World’s 5-star airline’ but it must ensure that it behaves like one and not allow its VIPs to let their staff enjoy the business cabin without actually paying for it.

D Walker",,8th May 2014,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,7,Very good service providing the price. Staff are very helpful and very attentive to any request you put to them. Entertainment was good but kept disconnecting / freezing during the flight but was always fixed. On our connecting flight from Doha to DXB the rear toilets were not in use and the door kept slamming open during the flight. Overall I would use Qatar again considering the price.

M Coleman",,6th May 2014,,First Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,9,HBE-DOH First Class Airbus 320. Usual high quality afforded to me. Food and beverages very good staff attentive. Flight out personal DVD but limited films Flight back Personal TV with usual high selection of movies. Unfortunately on this route as its not popular you tend to get older planes.

D Morgan",,5th May 2014,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,6,"We travel LHR-JNB or LHR-CPT regularly usually on Emirates British Airways or South African but this was our first time on Qatar travelling LHR-JNB via Doha. Online check-in was fine and worked well at LHR and the Premium Lounge at Heathrow is good with good service and decent food. LHR-DOH leg was on new Dreamliner and all-in-all pretty good. DOH-JNB leg was on a quite new Boeing 777. Service on both legs was very attentive and the food and drinks not bad if uninspiring and not as good as Emirates or SAA on the same LHR-JNB trip. Wine selection wasn't wide but acceptable. Seats were fine if a little narrower on the B777 and didn't fold into a completely flat bed which is disappointing and again not as good as Emirates but we did manage to sleep reasonably well. IFE was pretty good on all legs. Standards and aircraft on the return trips were the same but both departures from Doha were delayed; by 50 minutes on the return leg and by 55 minutes on the outbound 50 of which were spent sitting the tarmac. Doha airport is a mess with a quite long ""luxury"" bus trip from the Arrivals and the Premium Transfer Terminal. The Qatar lounge in the Premium Terminal at Doha is good if rather large and impersonal and Qatar use the Shongolo Lounge at JNB which is pretty good although a little in need of decoration at the far end near the windows. All-in-all Qatar was reasonably good and the flights were 30% cheaper than Emirates BA and SAA but we probably won't be flying with them again."

Seran Karunaharan",,5th May 2014,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,We flew last month from SIN-DOH-YUL sectors. It was a very long flight. The check-in at Changi airport was really smooth and the check in staff were really quick and helpful. The inflight meals and service were exceptional. Qatar Airways proves again and again why its a 5-star airline mostly due to their customer service cabin service and exceptional professionalism. The kids really loved the IFE inflight service and the caring staff. The transit at DOH was pretty quick and the next flight to YUL was a long one again. The cabin staff and the inflight service made our long journey a very relaxing one and enjoyable one. Hats off to Qatar airways staff. I would definitely fly Qatar airways again in the future.

D Wilson",,29th April 2014,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,,,3,no,4,Hong Kong - Madrid via Doha. Three of the planes were far too hot the food was dire especially the breakfasts each flight was delayed and changing planes in Doha airport is horrendous with incredibly long bus journeys to the terminals and then a madly cramped terminal to deal with. The air hostesses were mixed with two flights being fine but one flight having a very angry hostess. I'm going back to Air China Etihad and Emirates for long haul to Europe.

Farhana Mustafa",,28th April 2014,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,Flew with my family FRA-DOH then DOH-SIN two days later. We were travelling with our 7 month old baby. Check-in agent in FRA and DOH were both serious and seemed unhappy to have us at their counter. Both did not give any eye contact when they spoke to us. They were very much focused on assigning the seats for us and our baby. Also the food tray for one of our seats was not cleaned and had some food stains on it. But apart from this all else was excellent. They accommodated our 7 pieces of luggage FAs were attentive and were constantly present throughout the flight. Food was fantastic especially on the DOH-SIN leg. I couldn't get enough of their IFE (so much to choose from). Seats were very comfortable and on the FRA-DOH leg they ensured seats around us were free so that we have plenty of room for our baby. Can't say the same for our experience at DOH airport though. But will not comment about that here.

Gurusinga Darma",,27th April 2014,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,,,4,no,3,QR 240 IST-DOH and QR 844 DOH-KUL. Again Qatar changed our seats that we booked 4 months before. They separated 6 of us without any reason. Flight was delayed 30 minutes lunch service was very late. Doha airport was busy: they called for boarding went down to the ground floor the bus had still not come we have to wait 30 minutes in a small room with limited seating and without air conditioning. QR 844 use B777-3ER this flight was much better. Still no hot towel in the morning.

The leg between Stockholm and Doha was particularly good in one of the new Dreamliners with champagne being served in economy class to mention one of the many positive things.

R Hippe",,24th April 2014,,Business Class,,,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,5,KTM-DOH-FRA in March. Business Class. Very bad and unorganized crew on flight KTM-DOH. Took ages to serve a drink. Dinner service started as all passengers in economy had nearly finished. My choice was no longer available. Nearly all passengers upgraded from economy. Still recommend because of the really excellent crew on flight DOH-FRA and the high level of service received here. Angled lie flat seats only not very comfortable. Both flights delayed aircraft change from Dreamliner to old A330.

P Bowen",,23rd April 2014,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,3,yes,7,Phnom Penh - Nice. Service onboard is superb. Fine food great choice of movies and excellent service as a whole although when plane is full service tends to be slow. The problem with Qatar is the transfers in Doha. It is from another age and the new airport which was supposed to be finished by 2012 is not yet in service. Thus you have to climb stairs to get into the plane and have a 20 minute ride on the tarmac before getting to the lounge areas. Still one of the best flying experience of my life. Will fly again with them when they have their new airport ready.

R Opiekan",,21st April 2014,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,,,5,no,5,QR905 MEL-DOH QR259 DOH-WAW QR184 VIE-DOH QR904 DOH-MEL. Flights between Doha and Warsaw and Vienna and Doha were good completely opposite to the longer haul. Midnight flight out of MEL thought I would be able to sleep for the first part - wrong. Hot meal served about 1.5 hrs into flight sometime before cabin lights turned off. Cabin crew don't insist on seats upright at meal times so bit squashed if person in front has seat fully reclined and meals not as good as shorter flights. No foot rests so legs soon started aching 1am flight out of DOH on return sleeping when meal came so didn't get any drinks/meal until 2 hrs before landing in MEL. Toilets only two per section not cleaned often enough one was out of all paper products long queues.

Anders Pedersen",,19th April 2014,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,SGN-DOH-NBO on 17-18 April 2014. Airbus 330 and 320 respectively. Check-in in Saigon polite but the staff (outsourced by QR to local company) at check-in was very inexperienced and pedantic and insisted on seeing onwards tickets visa etc so it took me 15 minutes at the counter. Flights punctual and service on top. All my personal preferences (seating food drinks) were accommodated. From Saigon I got an excellent dinner including 3 alternative options offered. I had a fish meal of very high class. Wines served from large bottles and several choices including champagne. IFE worked well. I was offered an upgrade to business class for 700 USD which I eventually declined though tempted. The dreadful bus-shuttling at Doha airport takes some credit away from my score for overall rating. Lounge access (gold card) smooth. DOH-NBO a bit more modest on-board service but still 3 options for dinner. Luggage arrived smoothly.

Pierre-Jean Trebuchet",,16th April 2014,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,5,yes,6,"CDG-DOH-DWC flown April 16th. CDG-DOH was overall a good flight however check-in at CDG was very chaotic and police control was a mess. Other big black point: the ""Icare"" lounge at CDG 1 with no showers nor private toilets. Equipment was an A340-600 which was pretty dirty. A real shame. The saving grace was the good service on-board. For a change transfer at DOH was a breeze and Oryx Lounge was really appreciable. DOH-DWC: messy flight with rude and unprofessional Moroccan hostesses only Chef de Cabine did her best. DWC Al Maktoum airport seems to be a big joke."

Same thing happened on LHR to DOH leg on 3rd April. Both times communication poor. DOH to LHR leg staff abrupt lunch service didn't start until 4.30pm (2.5 hours into flight) and was slow. I was bypassed both at drinks service and lunch and had to ask for drinks and my meal. There was no duty free service. The cabin crew seemed very inexperienced and flustered towards the end of the flight. All in all very poor.

N Madden",,15th April 2014,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,,3,no,3,Flew FRA to Singapore via Doha. First leg FRA-DOH was not pleasant packed with uncomfortable seats. DOH-SIN got better as they transferred me to a bulkhead seat. Return was not bad. Major issue seems to be Doha airport both inbound flights were late arriving and transfer takes an age leaving you running to the gate to get the connection. Another frustration is lack of options when trying to pick your seat on-line in advance. Next time I would probably go back to Emirates-Dubai.

O Omar",,14th April 2014,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,,,4,yes,8,Flew CAI-DXB via DOH. First leg was a tired old A330-200 that has clearly seen better days. PTV is older- generation and is not touch-screen. The control buttons were built into the armest making it very difficult to use them. System was very slow and kept crashing. In the end I could not watch a movie. Dinner was a choice of chicken or fish and not bad at all. Drinks were a selection of soft drinks juices and alcoholic drinks. Service was very good. Crew were friendly and dedicated assisting passengers with young children. The second leg DOH-DXB was operated by an A320. Service was very rushed (usual chicken or veggie wrap and water or juice) but on the shorter legs no one cares. Overall a good experience despite the old A330-200s which should get refitted as soon as possible. QR offers a 40kg baggage allowance ex Cairo and a choice of up to three departures from Cairo making them a convenient and reliable airline.

We a family of 4 2 adults and 2 kids do at least 4 international return trips a year - including 2 business class long haul flights. I have flown Qatar business class once but after this last flight our preferred airline is going to stay Thai - both for the better airport quality and the much better quality and service onboard and on the ground. Qatar flights were late both to and from Kathmandu our baggage did not connect on the outbound and ground staff in Doha claimed our almost empty hand luggage to be too big. I noticed the overhead bins on the flight were pretty empty.

C Allinson",,13th April 2014,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,LHR-PVG via Doha and then PEK-LHR via Doha again. These flights were the cheapest on the market when I purchased them in January and having had my first experience with Qatar last year I was delighted to book these flights for £450. 3 of the flights were on the B777 with the fourth being on the B787 Dreamliner. I had a window seat for all flights but would not book another window seat on the Dreamliner - there is a metal box just where your leg closest to the window should be! I was lucky in that I was sitting next to a waif of a girl who only required about 1cm of leg space so I was able to stretch my legs into her space. Service was good and food was adequate. I'm of the opinion that I get on an aeroplane to fly to a destination rather than for an extraordinary gastronomic experience and these flights did little to change that opinion. Inflight entertainment offering was good though my system did not work between London and Doha and the person sitting next to me on a later flight also suffered the same problem. In both instances the stewardesses seemed disinterested.

Natalia Radcliffe",,13th April 2014,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,,,2,no,2,The outbound leg from LHR T4 to Doha was on a very old plane (still had cigarette disposal units). My partners' TV screen did not work. Although my screen did work the control panel was permanently embedded in the arm rest - not only did this make it highly awkward to use but the buttons were not programmed to correlate to the places displayed on screen. On the return leg from Doha to LHR the plane was just as bad - plus there were no bags containing earplugs and eye masks left for passengers! The PA system was not working well and kept deafening the passengers with feedback. To top this off there were only 2 loos available for what must have been around 200 economy passengers. I would never choose to fly Qatar again.

J Howsam",,8th April 2014,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,Economy - LHR to Melbourne. Boeing 777-200/300. Flying through middle east is slightly shorter than the traditional stop in Singapore or another Asian city and Qatar is about as good as economy class gets. The food was excellent and the drinks and snacks service which came several times on the longer Doha-Melb leg the noticeable difference with other full service airlines. That and they still give you the little toothbrush and socks. That longer leg to Melbourne is also overnight in both directions which is handy for sleeping and staying on your body clock. Oryx entertainment system also excellent although the TV shows lacked variety. For my regular trips home to Aus I'm now to looking to Qatar first.

Peter Lewis",,7th April 2014,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Flew LHR-SIN via Doha. Flown many times on Qatar always in J class. B777 is superb but older Airbus A330/340 product not as good but believe they are having interior upgrade to newer B787 style - we flew our first B787 on the initial LHR-DOH leg and it was fantastic. Could not pick a single fault and as a plane geek it truly is an amazing aircraft made the B777 feel almost outdated which is crazy as they are still fantastic aircraft and so spacious. Both were less than a month old! Qatar lounge in LHR is a real treat-up there with the BA Concorde Room in my opinion - worth getting there early just to enjoy the food wine and ambience. Looking forward to the new Doha airport as current transit can be a bit of a bore but would still chose to fly Qatar above any other airline despite the connection. Great fares and now Oneworld membership make it a no brainer for me and my family.

The flight attendants were most attentive and the food excellent. Arriving at Doha and going to the Premium Transfer complex is a breeze. Food seating capacity showers it is all there and certainly a notch over most other airlines' premium facilities I would say. Had a few hours to spend in the Premium facility and time passed quickly. The flight from Doha to KL was excellent also: flight attendants present and anticipating your needs. The food very good indeed. My only problem with the Airbus 330-300 is the angled seats when trying to sleep. I thoroughly dislike them as there is not much space to put things away and one is not lying flat (I need a flat surface for medical reasons). I don't understand why the seats are angled in the Airbus but not on the 777? I hope to fly again with Qatar but on their Boeing 777 rather than on their Airbuses.

B Morris",,1st April 2014,,Business Class,,,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,,4,no,5,LHR-DOH-COK. While the outbound flights were comfortable with clean planes and reasonable service our return flights were terrible. It all seems to depend on how busy business class. From the start checking in at Cochi airport took such a long time since the person at the desk seemed to have a difficult time checking in our bags through the London. As always the business lounge in Doha was packed. The main problem was on our morning flight from Doha to London. When breakfast service finally started we were informed that only 2 of the 5 mains that were listed on the menu were available. They were a choose of pancakes or waffles. Basically not much of a choice. When I asked if I could get more fruit or muesli I was told 'No'. The snack that was offered just before landing was also very limited and nothing of interest. Overall the in-flight service was terrible. Their response to my comments about the lack of choice for breakfast was that if I wanted a special meal I should have requested one. I would not recommend flying them in any class given their poor in-flight and customer service.

Plane in excellent condition very clean and seats extremely comfortable with plenty of leg room for a big guy like me (I am 6 ft 2). Inflight entertainment excellent with plenty of choice. The only real let down is the food which was terrible both ways and overwhelmed staff who did the bare minimum. The buses to the plane in Doha are a nightmare and it took over an hour to board the full 777 which resulted in a minor delay. The new Hamad airport should solve this pretty soon. The price was cheap I would definitely use them again in economy especially in long haul since the comfort they offer beats out Emirates or Etihad any day. European carriers business class is worse than QR economy.

Boarding was a bit slow at Singapore Changi Airport but once on board seats were wider than most airlines and plenty of legroom! Staff were extremely professional towels and sweets handed out before take off meals promptly served upon departure cabin crew brought drinks regularly to customers etc. Touch screen IFE on the 77W was excellent though not as many choices as their Mid-East competitor Emirates. Smooth landing in Doha before midnight. Connected to QR 009 four hours later onto a A346 - service was once again excellent with regular drinks services and meals served promptly. The IFEs on the A346 were older but choices of movies the same as the 77W. Seats were once again comfortable but this time there was less legroom and seat width. Landed in London on time and bags on the belt within half an hour. Extremely pleased with the service and excellent value for money.

Service on this flight was excellent - crew brought drinks regularly meals were served as soon as flight departed Paris and snack was give before landing at Doha and always a smile on the faces of the crew as they went around the cabin. There was leg space and seat width on the A346 but luckily for me the flight was not full and I had a whole row to myself. IFEs were older but nevertheless selection of movies were good. Extremely smooth landing at Doha before scheduled arrival time transfer to the terminal took about 10 minutes but once inside was able to connect to my next flight to Singapore with time to spare (I had a 1 hour 25 minute transit). QR 938 to Singapore on newer B77L flight was even emptier than the last so another row to myself as well. Seats wider on this aircraft with lots of legroom. Service was excellent once again towels and sweets passed around drinks came regularly breakfast served after takeoff and snack served before arrival in Singapore. Flight landed ahead of time. I would certainly recommend Qatar Airways and look forward to flying them again on my next trip - the airline is really going places especially with the new Hamad Airport set to open its doors within the next year or so.

Anders Pedersen",,30th March 2014,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,7,NBO-DOH-SGN on 29 March. Airbus 320 (3x3 seat configuration) and 330 (2x4x2 seat configuration) respectively. Aircraft's neat and in good condition. Flights on time. Announcements were good. Staff attending and try their best though rarely suggest outside the box. Priority members highly respected recognized and acknowledged. FAs hardworking and attentive call buttons answered quickly. IFE good but not of my priority. Night-flights after midnight serve no dinner in economy very annoying for me. No beer options only a trivial Heineken is offered. What a pity as the world have so much better options to offer. Doha airport still a nightmare packed and imprisoned in busses without information or reasoning. A 2-days delayed bag from my previous trip was not compensated.

Chris Hall",,29th March 2014,,Economy Class,,,5.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,,,1,no,2,Melbourne to London via Doha. Late leaving Melbourne by 2 hours we missed the connection at Doha. Waiting at Doha airport gave me time to check the departure boards and every single plane was late departing. At times there were nine planes waiting to takeoff. We boarded our plane on time but then waited 70 minutes before it took off. It was a tired old A330 clean but hopeless AV system with controls fastened to the side of the seats which were difficult to operate. Immigration at LHR was prompt but we waited for more than an hour for our bags! Doha Airport just cannot handle the increased number of flights as Qatar Airways increases the number of flights. This can only get worse until they get a second runway.

R András",,28th March 2014,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,NRT-DOH-BUD Tokyo to Doha was on a 772LR. The service was excellent with choices ranging from Japanese dishes to westerner quite nice selection of wines as well. Inflight entertainment was good with plenty of movies to chose from. Even though the seat wasn't a fully flat bed I had a good sleep and woke up rested before landing to Doha. The next leg to Budapest was on a 321 not bad but you can't compare it with the business class from the wide- bodied aircraft's. Overall I would recommend flying Qatar Airways I had a good experience.

Overall good experience 788 is a great plane clean toilets nice seats good IFE. Excellent wine selection which you often only find in First Class of other carriers. Food was poor no taste and little selection. That was better when I last took them. Staff were great on all flights and hopefully the transfer in DOH will one day be without busses. However: Staff in Frankfurt on check in as well as in DXB (both contracted) were unfriendly not interested in helping and the look and feel of the check in area was in both cases shabby.

I had time to visit Doha at night during my transit. From Doha to Phnom Penh the flight was also agreeable but I was disappointed that no message was made for boarding. One hour before departure I started seeing people getting in line to embark. I waited until the last moment and mentioned to the Qatar staff that I didn't hear any announcement for boarding was that common practice? The staff member replied that they usually made an official announcement but this time they had not Besides that I really enjoyed flying Qatar Airways.

R Young",,24th March 2014,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,10,We flew from CDG via DOH to JNB and couldn't have been happier! Food and service excellent. Very clean toilets. We didn't use the inflight entertainment and therefore can't comment. Bus ride from plane to terminal seemed to take forever. Premium Terminal hopelessly overcrowded when we got there without a single table for 2 in sight. Fortunately we didn't have a long transfer time on our way back to CDG and could almost board immediately. We will definitely continue to take Qatar Airways for all of our long distance flights even if it means changing planes in Doha instead of going direct. Not only is Business Class so much more affordable than other European airlines but it is simply so much better as well! Keep up the great service!

In Doha we were left in a holding area with approximately 100 other passengers with no ventilation air con or access to water in high temperatures with seats for only a dozen people whilst was waited for the nonsense of being bussed to our next flight. This happened on both the outward and return flights. Onboard staff were unfriendly and everything seemed too much trouble. Food was mediocre at best and repetitive. The entertainment system is outdated. I cannot recommend.

Transfer at Doha airport is obviously the same chaos Silver Privilege Club Lounge is quite grotty. DOH-BCN: A332 equipment totally disorganized cabin crew. Food was fair just fair.

May be also my expectations were too high. Meals and wine cart are really very good. But the service is very slow. It's a real problem on the evening flight from Paris - it took almost 2 hours to have a dinner which is long as result - not much time to sleep. Seats are quit comfortable on A340 but not exceptional not comfortable at all on A321 (but it looks they will be replaced now). Transfer by buses in Doha is not an issue and Premium terminal is very big and provides a lot of place and different drinks and meals. What is strange: they don't serve champagne before take off in Paris but they do in Doha and in Male.

The seat on the B777 is great better for me than the new 787 one as I never travel alone and always wanted a window seat. Crew were excellent except on the short SIN-DPS.

The last flights I had was from JKT-DOH DOH-ANK IST-DOH DOH-JKT. All staff were polite friendly responsive and helpful. For economy class the seats have more space than EK or EY. The only complaint is transferring at Doha was not as convenient as transferring in Abu Dhabi or Dubai.

Having said that seats are comfortable in-flight entertainment is pretty good food is ok but doesn't seem to change often (if at all) and flight attendants really do depend - have had really great ones and have had rude ones.

Good movie options clear screen and sound. Seats were comfortable and roomy I also had 2 seats to myself which helped. Service was good the food was ok offered plenty and had some lovely bruschetta in-between meals. Boarded a different plane from DOH to PER this was definitely an older plane. I was in an aisle seat and it was the most uncomfortable plane I've been on. Staff never smiled and when you asked for a drink they seemed annoyed. The food wasn't that good. On the return I had an 11 hour PER to DOH and this only bearable because I luckily had a row to myself so lay down and slept. Again staff never smiled and there was only one girl who was friendly. On the next 7 hour flight to LHR I was absolutely freezing! So much so I had to ask for a 2nd blanket.

I'm looking forward to see what my return flight has in store including a visit to the dreaded bidvest lounge in Cape Town which makes a wait in the terminal more pleasant than visiting the 'exclusive' lounge. Flagship premium terminal service and offering appalling. Will switch to another larger gulf carrier from now on despite frequent flyer status.

Bangkok - Doha - Warsaw: Boeing 777 the plane was really old and my seat had a broken audio.

Outward flight from Doha delayed (awaiting connecting passengers) which meant I missed my connection in Jo'burg. This was on South African but booked as through ticket with Qatar. No-one from Qatar to assist on arrival. SA would not rebook. Had to search airport for Qatar desk (which was in international departures miles away (and well hidden). This was highly stressful after 2 flights. Return trip flight one hour late into Doha. Efficient transit meant I caught the London flight but again one hour late. It seems that the transit for many passengers is leading increasingly to delays. Inflight service ok. 777 comfortable - 340 less so and poorer AVOD. Choice of films etc was excellent. Food tolerable but had the same chicken wrap 3 times and breakfast orange squash described as orange juice was disgusting. 3 flights out of 4 were an hour late. I would probably try to fly direct next time.

Crew excellent as usual on both of these sectors. Return sectors with a long layover at DOH (I left the airport to visit the city). CMB-DOH 17 Feb 2014 was on a B777 excellent leg room but IFE screen kept freezing and restarting of its own accord.

There is no where to store your glasses while you are sleeping. Drinks come only on request. Qatar Airways is not willing to transfer your baggage to another airlines. You have to pay extra or go through immigration to collect it and check in new. The infotainment is not that great. If the flight is cheap go for it.

The flight service food etc. were good but we expected more space between seats. For a long haul flight it is inconvenient to have the seat in front of you almost in your arms and sitting in the window seat causes a lot of disturbances when trying to move from the seat.

Excellent 777-3 first sector then less good less spacious not horizontal seat but acceptable A330-3. Both sectors left and arrived late without reasons or apologies from captain which is slack. Breakfast on 1st sector could have been better and more substantial as most pax would have had very early start to get flight and lounge at CMB didn't offer much. Boarding at CMB is hectic but J class pax were told to push their way to the front! Would be better if they called you from lounge after the melee had died down. Short transfer was fine at a quiet mid day DOH. LHR sector crew very nice but service procedures could be improved - they needed reminding to serve my partner and I together so we could eat at same time. Angled lie flat seat was OK for daylight flight. You had to ask for fast track immigration invitation. J class bags came last at LHR not QR's fault.

LHR-DOH was 1 hour late giving more time to enjoy great lounge but arrived DOH 15mins early and was the best J class flight I've ever had. Catering was superb but it seems you had to ask for afternoon tea service. DOH transfer was fine: yes the coach is slow but you're sitting comfortably and you get a view of the action of a busy airport. DOH-CMB also left late but there were no apologies or reasons from captain and no attempt to make up time en route.

Having identified myself to cabin crew as a club member instead of being given an early choice of menu items I was told when they served dinner that my first choice was finished. However they somehow rustled up my first choice unfortunately it was inedible.

No airbridges means we had to shuttle in a bus for flight that was to take off right on time. Saw Dreamliner marking near tail and had mixed feelings of excitement and fear. 10 min into seating and pilot announced some technical snag. 10 more minutes and he announced that the wind shield had cracked and we that the plane can't take off. Surprisingly QR managed to arrange alternate plane of exact make sat us comfortably and took off in an hour. Food and IFE were perfect for 4 hrs long flight. I did not miss my connection from Bangalore. Wanted to shop for a few things in-flight but unfortunately they had run out of stock. We fly for safe and on time travel.

On one leg (Doha to London) several women who were seated in business class but had children in economy class - these children were allowed to repeatedly run through business class cabin disturbing other passengers. These passengers also repeatedly ignored safety instructions viz seatbelt signs and mobile phone regulations. Overall flights were on time and otherwise comfortable. We would also comment that the boarding arrangements at Colombo were complete chaos with no separate boarding for premium passengers - a total free for all. Finally on one leg (London to Doha) my wife's inflight entertainment had no sound.

A recent fire meant there was no longer a lounge facility available but as premium passengers we were not offered anything in recompense. Even a voucher to enable us to get some food and drinks at the two upstairs cafes would have helped but on enquiry we were told that business class passengers were to get nothing just as the economy passengers. Thankfully the flight in an airbus A320 was comfortable and we were well looked after and the same could be said of the Doha - Manchester sector.

First leg was on the 777-300ER and was fine with very friendly and attentive staff. However staff had no idea about where we should go when we landed and I insisted that they were wrong about where they were sending us as we were having a one night layover. However staff insisted that we take the bus and get off at the Premium Lounge. This was of course wrong and we had to wait for a new bus to take us to immigration. Several movies were not showing on the plane but still it was ok. Personally I do prefer Emirates as they seem to have better entertainment onboard and better service. I only used Qatar cause they had joined Oneworld Alliance.

Very friendly and attentive service from dominantly Eastern European and Subcontinental crews. 1-2-1 configuration in 788 business class very nice indeed and A320 business class quite comfortable too (even though not good for sleeping). Some inconsistencies in service on some flights my oneworld Emerald status was acknowledged on some not. A very annoying aspect of Qatar service is that the oneworld Emerald status does not give you access to First class facilities and you don’t get First class labelling to your luggage. This is different from other oneworld carriers with First class (at least British Airways Cathay Pacific and Qantas) and puts Qatar in an inferior position. The IFE was quite impressive (also on A320s) but did not match the latest IFE on Cathay 77Ws. Qatar provides top notch quality but I would say that Cathay is par at food and beverages but still slightly better in service and much better in attention to details. Cathay’s First class lounges are very nice too its difficult to provide a comparison as I was not admitted to the Qatari facility. In summary I probably will consider Qatar to destinations in East and West Africa and the Middle East but necessarily to South East Asia as changing planes in Doha late in the evening is a nuisance when compared to flying the long Europe – Asia leg non-stop after having enjoyed BA/CX First class hospitality while waiting for the flight.

All flights arrived on time but very poor boarding arrangements in DOH and SIN and mixed aircraft experience marred the trip! A330 is quiet and fairly spacious but was showing serious signs of age B777 was a much better flying experience with much more space and comfort and the B787 was a big let down. Despite the good mood lighting and darkened windows on the B787 the manufacturers seem to have used such flimsy and lightweight components that it just doesn't seem as if it is going to last. Plastic panels in three toilets were split as were two panels around the cabin window toilet seat broken in one sink blocked in two seats flex and creek and aisle is way too narrow. The cabin service was good and consistent throughout the food quality was mixed (as usual) champagne on flights from UK is a nice touch and decent wine served throughout remaining flights. However all of the above comments pale into insignificance compared to the loathsome experience of Doha airport; it is truly awful. And no one from QR can say when this sorry airport state will end.

My experiences at Heathrow T4 were very pleasant check in was easy and the lounge was not far after security. The lounge itself was very pleasant and the level of service excellent. The range of refreshments and services cannot be praised highly enough. The airline had a cart at the lounge to drive passengers to the gate - a very nice touch. The inflight experience was great. I decided to miss dinner and it was great to just lay on a comfortable flat bed and catch a good few hours sleep. I flicked through the inflight entertainment and was not too impressed by the range of media although if I was not as frequent a traveller then the entertainment on offer would have been fine. On arriving at Doha nice to be taken to the transit area in a BMW. I was only in Doha for 3 hours but again the lounge was very pleasant and relaxing. The flight to Dhaka was in Business Class but very good all the same. The only poor aspect was the wait for baggage in Dhaka but then that's not really Qatar's fault. I would certainly fly with Qatar in future.

Was trapped inside the bus for sometime very stuffy. The Oneworld flagship aircraft is very generous with sit pitch sufficient amenity kit headphone waiting in the seat pocket. Excellent in flight entertainment and sound system flawless catering and the snack was awesome. Would like to see a cabin crew with a warm smile but the cabin crew serving my area has done a satisfactory performance. Full flight and would take this airline for another time definitely.

After flying Emirates for the past 5 years always as a Gold member Qatar was overall a very positive experience on fights QR1366 CPT-DOH QR119 DOH-MXP. On my way back flight QR122 A320-100/200 MXP-DOH has 12 seats ""business class"" which is not even a super economy: no space no privacy impossible to have some rest. Cannot understand why Qatar uses such a small aircraft overnight! QR1365 DOH-CPT was a very nice experience."

Michael Powell",,20th January 2014,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,"LHR-DOH-PER on 27 December and back on 13 January. Dreamliner is brilliant. 777 on the DOH-PER leg not quite as comfortable - the seats are not actually 100% flat. The leg section sags which makes it hard to sleep completely comfortably. Service food and IFE impeccable. WiFi now allowed on the LHR-DOH Dreamliner and this is NOT a good idea. The person behind me was constantly receiving messages and didn't bother to turn his ringtone down. The usual bugbear of a ""scenic drive"" round Doha airport on the outward leg meant only 10 minutes in the (excellent) Premium Terminal. On the return leg both stands were near the Terminal but terminal time was reduced by being sent to the gate 40 minutes before boarding started."

Charles Lacoste",,20th January 2014,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,8,Flew QR 901 PER-DOH QR 721 DOH-ORD and on the way back QR 010 LHR-DOH and QR900 DOH-PER earlier this month. Needed very quick tickets to attend a funeral in the US…and Qatar was one of the few that had seats and an almost reasonable price. That said pretty impressed with the airline. Seats had good legroom - one minor issue was the lack of adequate padding - my whole family grumbled about it considering the many hours we were on their flights. We were all a little saddle-sore at the end of the long flights - and we were using the blankets as extra padding. Aircraft's were of course newish 777's with the exception of an A340 out of LHR…IFE was great… wide variety - razor-sharp seat-back screens - we particularly liked their selection of international movies. I'm diabetic and the meals they supplied were fine the rest of the family very happy with their meals as well. No complaints good tucker. Cabin crews varied from outstanding to good. On our last leg back to Perth staff did their job well - if not particularly happily. I did notice they didn't run up and down the aisles with drinks every hour - but given half (or more) of the cabin was usually asleep - I can see why. They were very quick to hand over juice or water whenever requested. Doha terminal is a definite let-down - the bus trips to and from the terminal are dreadful in this day and age. Inside the terminal is very ordinary. New terminal on the way promises to be much better. Would fly them again for sure.

This time I used the B787 from FRA to DOH which was a great experience. Nice and cosy cabin environment which large monitors delivering a sharp picture. All seats in business class have direct access to the aisles. Service and food as good as always. Looking forward to my next trip with QR hopefully the new airport in DOH will be ready then as the long bus rides at old airport are somehow annoying.

K Hughes",,14th January 2014,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,,,1,no,2,We have flown Qatar Airways economy class 4 times in the past 15 months. As we are now living in Doha for work purposes 3 of those 4 flights originated in Doha. Doha to JFK to Florida and back to Doha. Our first two flights 12 months ago in economy class were very nice. Much better than the other airlines we have travelled on for international flights. However in the past 12 months the other two flights have shown a huge decrease in quality of service and a huge increase in cost. The main difference that seems glaring is the level of attentiveness from the Flight Attendants the quality of food that is now being served and the huge cost increase.

Matthew Polick",,14th January 2014,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,,,2,no,4,We flew back from Delhi (QR 563) on 6th Jan. After an 8hr 21 min delay due to fog we discovered the aircraft was switched from the Dreamliner (787) to the A330. The switch in aircraft certainly extended the delay. The communication to update on the flight was terrible. Once we reached Doha we were told there was no other way back to NYC other than taking the flight on 7th Jan (QR 701). The transit process on 7th January felt was awful there was lack of communication. Once we reached the aircraft we waited and waited until the captain announced we would be delayed - ended up being 1hr 10 mins. While in the air the aircraft was new and we were lucky enough to have an emergency seat. The flight crew appeared tired and unwilling to be pleasant to passengers. Most of the food was barely edible. We landed and 1 hr and 32mins late with no apology or update from the pilot on our flight progress.

S Srinivasan",,13th January 2014,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,"IAH-DOH-MAA in Y. Check-in line looked horrendous at first but it moved well and we were on our way in about 30 minutes. I found it strange though that you first had to queue up for a baggage weight check then go to the counter and have your bags weighed again. IAH-DOH was in a B777-300ER. The 3-3-3 configuration that QR uses is far superior to the 3-4-3 setup that more and more airlines are using today as the extra inch or two of width provides a feeling of much more personal space. Seat pitch at 33 inches is also better than many long-haul carriers and as we had seats directly in front of a bulkhead had unlimited recline at our disposal which made for a more comfortable flight. I was able to get about 5 hours of sleep. Two meals are served with decent taste and quality and free wine beer and spirits available. I had heard horror stories about the transit procedure in DOH but found it quite painless and it took just 35 minutes to get from our plane through the bus ride and security and to our onward gate. Boarding process for our DOH-MAA leg was a bit chaotic. Boarding starts very early more than an hour before takeoff and you are initially herded into a holding area with far too few seats compared to the number of people. You are eventually boarded onto a bus followed by an extremely long ride to the plane at which point we were held for a further 5-10 minutes. Once on board everything was fine though I found the A330-200 considerably more cramped than the 777. The IFE box didn't help but the seats were also an inch narrower and with an inch less pitch. On both legs the IFE system is excellent with a wide variety of AVOD shows/movies and games along with a customizable flight map. Meal was the typical ""veg/non veg"" option you get headed to India and quality was not nearly as good as on the IAH-DOH leg. Service by the FAs was consistently excellent with every request attended to promptly and with a smile. Qatar offers a very good coach product overall and is a superior alternative to Emirates if you are headed to Asia or the Middle East."

Tercon Bojan",,13th January 2014,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,,,5,yes,8,Flying in Business Class from Bali - Singapore - Doha on the new 777-300ER is a remarkable experience. Qatar is definitely up there amongst the best in terms of inflight product on the 777-300ER. The seat converts into a fully-flat bed and although the layout is very open (compared to SQ and EK) given the 2-2-2 layout walking over your neighbour in order to reach the aisle is not overly cumbersome. The food and service was excellent although am not a huge fan of some of their colour choices for their uniforms. I also really liked the PJs that you get although then you realize that the bathrooms are very small and changing is not that easy. SQ for example has a much bigger lavatory up front and also more stylish. Qatar could improve on this. What I'm not a big fan of is their IFE system. It seems very simplistic trying to move the mouse around the basic user interface and the choice of movies is lacking. This was perhaps the biggest drawback on my Qatar flight.

Doha airport painful long bus to and from planes. Had booked Oryx lounge which is well worth it. Doha-Perth full but service still quick. 777 not as nice as 787 but still perfectly comfortable. Overall short flight time but service not as good as Singapore air. Will try Qatar airlines again once new Doha airport one but likely to stick to Singapore air until then.

The food was the best I've had in Business and a great anytime style menu. Seat was comfortable to sit in and the full lie flat beds were great. My wife and I both got a solid 8 hours sleep which is testament to the quality of the seat/bed. We were also provided with amenities pack and pyjamas which we made use of. Aircraft was modern and well looked after and flight smooth. I'd say its as good as if not better than Emirates business and considerably cheaper.

Food was also very good for an economy flight. A choice of 3 meals. Flight attendants were polite and friendly but because they have so many people to look after can come across a bit rushed. Doha - Melbourne 777-200LR . Seats didn't feel quite as comfortable but it didn't help that the person in front was reclined the whole way but alas so did I. Still managed to have a sleep. Flight attendants were polite and friendly. Food served while ok wasn't as good as the previous flight. Total flying time was around 17.5 hours from Berlin which was the quickest we have ever done it in and good if you have kids. One thing to mention we did have quite a few families near us and the staff really looked after them which was good to see. gave them some toys cool lunch boxes with meals in them and a little play time etc. Plane to terminal is by bus in Doha but with their new airport which is almost finished being built I think it'll be a thing of the past.

Now a days when some airlines seem to think of economy passengers as 'self loading cargo' it was refreshing to receive a level of service that I thought no longer existed! Very comfortable cabins very good catering and impressed with the cabin staff. Last time I flew to Asia I used Gulf Air: They out classed them.

Onboard the A330 was new and clean seats comfortable staff were very attentive and friendly. Food was outstanding the best first class food I ever had. The greatest drawback was the IFE.

Egli Olivier",,8th January 2014,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,,,4,yes,6,Flew Zurich-Doha-Bangkok in coach. What I experienced was not surprising but rather confirmed the different things I had read about them: first off the planes are almost brand new and in excellent shape. The inflight system especially on the Dreamliner is worth its name. The seat comfort on the 777 is superior to the 787 but legroom is adequate in both for a person my size (I am 176cm). The flight crew on the flight deck are very well trained. Communication is excellent. But service quality is not being lived up to by the cabin crew. On both flights we had an extremely tired and unamused looking crew. No smiles no communication. Secondly: the food! While the chicken on the way from Zurich to Doha was easily a masterpiece the meal on the leg from Doha was simply inedible. Layover in Doha is something to be avoided. The transfer ride is tiring the terminal is awful and the food court easily the worst. All over a decent experience.

Although staff called for boarding by seat numbers nobody took any notice. Both flights full service on board was poor to say the least. Inflight food although served hot was not appetising drink rounds for water and juices had to go to galley and ask for them only brought through cabin once on each sector.

S Steinfeld",,3rd January 2014,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,,,4,no,7,Economy SIN-ZRH-SIN via Doha. Flight operations were fine helped by the mostly very friendly and responsive staff and the use of state-of-the-art equipment (777/787). The choice and quality of the food was however nothing to rave about. Whatever its length any layover at Doha is painful to say the least. This is partially due to the poor infrastructure of the airport but also due to the rather chaotic organization of the airline's ground operations. On the way back I had a 8+ hour layover. I did not want to spend this time at the airport and booked a hotel. When enquiring at Zurich airport if I could leave the airport at Doha I was informed that this may be difficult. We still got off at the Arrival Terminal and - while the waiting period (about 1 hour) and the visa-on- arrival charge was a kick in the teeth immigration was smooth but getting away from the airport was again somewhat frustrating. The airline has potential but has to improve its ground services. In any case I will not take another flight with Qatar Airways until the new Doha airport is operational.

I was not impressed with the Dreamliner (787) that QR used for the flight from London to Doha and vice versa. The IFE did not work so we didn't have anything to watch or listen to. Some of the toilets were already in a mess. FAs were friendly and helpful. I should give them credit for trying to make the journey enjoyable. Flight from Doha to Kilimanjaro and the return flight were OK. The food was also average. Would I recommend QR? I would if you get the right price and if there is no choice.

When wanting to change the date of my return flight I was not helped at all on the phone nor through email/ website and when I actually went physically to their office in HK I was refused a change despite me wanting to pay for the difference.

I like the eat on demand service as we can time the meals. Great choice and great amenities. On route back we had a 8.5 hour lay over and had booked a room. But the thought of negotiating immigration was not very appealing and whiled away the time in the Premium lounge. Had sleeper couches and even fresh blankets and a great shower with L'Occitane toiletries. Spoilt for choice when it came to food.

No lounge access could be granted in NBO despite being a gold card holder. Hotel provided in Doha (upon prior request) as layover exceeded 8 hours. However due to Xmas transitters for hotels were stuck in immigration queues for almost 2 hours! It has hardly worth it. However the 4-star hotel provided in Doha was OK but somehow scraped. Doha-Saigon upgraded to business class from seat 30K to 1F. The business class standards are high food options plenty and service quick despite business class became full - mainly by those upgraded from economy which was completely overbooked. Seats not fully lie flat in the configuration encountered this time. A delay from Doha was unusual long for Qatar Airways. As a result we came to SGN 40 minutes late so I lost my onward connection and had to purchase new ticket from VN-airlines.

I was lucky as I was traveling with my husband but if I was sleeping that close to a stranger I wouldn't have enjoyed it. With other airlines you can put up a screen which you can't do on this plane. Worst inflight TV selection I've seen on a plane. Old movies and only a few new western release movies. Arrived into Doha for a 6 hour stop over and the Business Lounge is already looking very tired.

We were so disappointed which is hardly what I expected to be saying here Used Air France La Premiere lounge in Paris although nice had limited food offerings but comfortable. Boarding welcome and crew great but meal uninteresting and veal tough. Only served with rice. It did do the trick though as required no dessert. Cabin was not cleaned prior to landing. Our arrival in Doha was delayed which meant the long anticipated use of the Premium Lounge was not met as by the time we were bussed to terminal we were told we had to board in 10 minutes. No seating as lounge full to overflowing toilets dirty and two lots of security ate into our very limited time. Back on the bus and our flight to Melbourne. Greeted warmly and seats fantastic and for us that was where it ended. For first time Qatar users we were not informed that to eat we had to request and subsequently very little food actually offered for a 13 hour plus flight. When food was finally requested due to extreme hunger and no chance to eat at Doha we were told there would be a long wait as crew were resting. Very little cabin presence throughout flight. Pyjamas offered and most passenger used them but only saw one bed made up by crew. All in all not quite what we expected and if this particular flight is anything to go on will not fly with them again.

The 787 business class seat is outstanding and the entertainment screen is huge and sharp. Such a shame they fail horribly with the remote control/user interface. It is very slow and unresponsive. Whenever I tried to pause a film it would instead jump to the middle and I'd spend a lot of time fiddling and trying to get back to where I was. Several TV-shows (new) were of such low technical quality they might have been VHS recordings. The never-ending commercials that take over the entertainment system at the end of each flight are quite annoying. And please come up with a ""do not disturb"" solution. I don't like being woken up for a meal if I'm finally asleep."

Service has been gracious and attentive all the way through food served was tasty and freshly prepared. The business lounge in DOH welcoming and with a good food variety a lot of space for everyone and good facilities. Pity that you have to take the shuttle from the aircraft to the airport and return but I'm sure it will be resolved with the new terminal. I must add that I was a bit taken aback by the behaviour of the staff upon arrival in MEL: some paramedics and public health officers boarded the plane as soon as the gangway was connected and the flight attendants seemed to be very unprepared to handle the traffic flow of passengers off the aircraft and the boarding officers: very bizarre!

G Buchanan",,11th December 2013,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,6,Flight from Manchester to Bali (8/11/13) was a pleasant experience with fantastic crew on both legs. We even got a honeymoon cake on the first leg. Not a problem with the airline at all just some rude travellers flying with us. MAN-DOH Airbus A330-200 a bit tired but by no means old DOH-DPS Boeing 777-200ER modern aircraft and comfortable. The return journey however was a shambles (20/11/13). Denpasar to Doha with a stop in Singapore. DOH-MAN was a great flight although slightly rough arrived one hour early and the head Flight Attendant was very very pleasant with me and made me feel comfortable despite my fears. Older aircraft and a fair few AVOD systems not working including my own for the first 30 minutes of the flight. All they could do was reset it.

S Hameed",,11th December 2013,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,,4,yes,6,Traveled with my wife JFK-DOH-Cochin last month. Overall the flights were okay but to the food quality has nothing special. The service of cabin crew was good and satisfactory. Having traveled long haul flights with Qatar Airways before I am used to their service which is good.

Karen Clark",,9th December 2013,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,DPS-ORD-DPS. Our flight was delayed 4 hours out of Denpasar due to APEC being held in Bali and the airport being closed to the public at certain hours of the day. We knew this in advance and asked to change our flight a day earlier as we only had a 3 hour lay over in Doha before our flight to Chicago. Qatar assured us that the airport closure would not affect them and that changing our flight would incur a fee. We were met at Doha airport by ground staff who gave us the option of staying overnight or flying to Chicago without our luggage. As we had only two nights in Chicago we decided to fly without our luggage. The luggage arrived at our hotel the next day. In the air we always find the product and the service given very good and of a uniform quality. Our return flight left on time from Chicago with a 5 hour wait for our flight to Bali. This turned into a 12 wait as our flight was delayed. The captain made an announcement explaining the delay and apologized for any inconvenience This is the second time I have experienced problems with connections being late and whilst I understand these things happen I hope it does not become the norm. It feels like this airline is growing very fast and needs the new airport and new aircraft to keep up with demand. Their business class product is very good and we were not disappointed once we were in the air.

A Aziz",,5th December 2013,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,,3,no,6,Travelled on LHE-DOH-MAN flight in economy class. LHE-DOH was with 777-ER and had comfortable seats but DOH-MAN was A330 an old model with really congested seats. Not only this but inflight crew were not helpful. Food quality is just enough but most of all I found Doha airport really dis-satisfactory. The transit terminal and arrivals are served with buses and that makes transit very painful especially if travelling with kids. I am not impressed with Qatar Airways.

Nadkarni Rahul",,2nd December 2013,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,Flew Business class on Goa-Doha-New York (JFK) on 13 Nov and return on 27 Nov New York (JFK) - Doha-Goa. The flight from Goa to Doha was an A321 which did not have fully lie flats seats but recliner type seats which were ok considering the flight was short and lasted only for about 3.5 hours. The service on the flight was excellent and staff addressed you by name. The food was good but it was more in the continental style. The premium lounge in Doha was superb with an excellent spread and nice ambience. The shower areas were great. The flight from Doha to JFK was a Boeing 777-300 ER which had fully lie flat seats and were really comfortable. The AVOD system was good. Service provided by staff was again excellent and they made an extra effort to make you comfortable. Pyjamas sets were provided plus Salvatore Ferragmo pouches. Food was good but again of continental style rather the Middle Eastern style which was my preference. The luggage arrived before economy class and we were out clearing immigration in no time. On the return flight from JFK airport the American Airlines lounge called the Admirals lounge was pathetic you could only get one coke water or beer per person. You could have a few cookies some fruit and some salty titbits as complimentary everything else you had to pay for. The return flight was very similar to outbound flight and same great service was provided with similar amenities. All in all a very satisfying experience and we would surely fly Qatar airways again.

David Stahl",,29th November 2013,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,"Stockholm-Doha-Kochi (India) on Nov 26. I have done this trio many times with QR and I'm very satisfied. The new Dreamliner from Stockholm to Doha is very comfortable spacious and silent. But I couldn't see that the windows were bigger! A spacious galley with fruits cakes and an unopened champagne bottle. Plenty of space for legs hand baggage and computer reading materials and other small things at the seat. The toilet are very spacious. On the Doha-Kochi sector they have put in bigger aircraft's with ""angled lie flat chairs"" in Business class. A big improvement to the old planes on this sector. Very friendly staff competent they managed to make my computer hook on to the WiFi system onboard. In QR business class you can get food served whenever you want. On an earlier flight on the same sector they wanted to serve a third dinner on the flight Doha-Kochi (the two earlier were on Stockholm-Doha and in Doha terminal) but I asked for breakfast instead and they gave me a really good breakfast! The staff was apologetic that they couldn't give me an omelette but I tried to convince them that it didn't matter. I call that service. I feel the staff onboard is QR's best resource airport staff are very good too."

R Barton",,28th November 2013,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,MAN-DOH-BKK-HAN-SGN-DOH-MAN. Really impressed with the seats service and entertainment on all flights. World class airline in same bracket as Emirates and Etihad. Arguably Singapore Airlines still marginally superior. 777 seats wider and entertainment system better than A330 however 2-4-2 layout is preferable for couples relative to the 3-3-3 777 layout. Fortunate to be upgraded to business on the red eye SGN - DOH flight which was great notwithstanding that particular A330 being an older example. Still extremely comfortable and accommodated an excellent night's sleep. Check in for all sectors fine Doha airport bus transfers a bit of a novelty but acceptable and soon to be replaced. Will certainly use the airline again if priced most competitively as was the case in this instance.

Farouk Mogheth",,22nd November 2013,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,7,Bangkok-Doha-Cairo and back. All in all a very pleasant and civilized experience. Reservation and online check in and seat selection a breeze. At the airport very pleasant staff and my online check in had me bypass a rather huge line at the regular check in as I only needed a baggage drop off. The colour coding of Qatar Airways and the airport is great. The check-in was handled in Bangkok perfectly with rows as well as seats navigated from the left 1 and 2 doors. This resulted in a very speedy and no stress boarding of a fully booked huge airliner. Staff were great with a personal service but without the over-cheesy attitude of another Middle Eastern airline. The food was good and the staff ran every 30-45 minutes with drink rounds. Connection was short and the airport OK. Flight to Cairo was good and the staff had to work double to control passengers that simply ignore every and each announcement from standing while landing etc. The return flight was good but certain points ruined the perfect first impression. Check in was closed but the screens were on and staff at economy check in with a large crowd. The boarding was terrible but I guess I can attest to the less than friendly Cairo terminal 1 holding gates that is barely enough for a small plane but not a 100% booked 777-300. It was a bit of chaos and people standing everywhere. Very claustrophobic. I would suggest Qatar to change its check in counters from the very tight side of T1 as there was no space whatsoever and to request 2 gates since at the moment of waiting to be bussed to the plane it was a less than 1 star experience. Otherwise the flights were on time food great and staff consistent. Definitely will recommend and I believe that the new airport in Qatar is desperately needed. The transfer was very easy and rather pleasant but the terminal was a bit too basic. So 7/10 just for not being able to handle check in and boarding as elegantly as in Bangkok. Qatar should look into it.

Sergio Kapusta",,21st November 2013,,Business Class,,,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,,,3,yes,5,4 Nov Houston-Doha QR714 and 15 Nov Doha-Houston QR713. Business class. Check in at Houston: the desk staff did not know whether coach class seats had power outlets. They do as anyone can find out on the Qatar Airways website. Continuing with the flight attendants. They all seemed to be in-training: could not remember to bring coffee or water even though they were very attentive just not very efficient. On both ways my choice of food was not available. I had to ask 2 or 3 times each way for dessert. The 777LR aircraft in a 2x2x2 business class configuration is not very comfortable being trapped for 16 hours between a window and a sleeping passenger. Doha Airport on both arrivals and departures is undeserving of the beautiful and progressive country of Qatar. Taking my hand luggage down the stairs up the bus off the bus up to immigration is a chore and nobody from the airline offered any help. Overall not a bad airline.

R Walmsley",,18th November 2013,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,PER-DOH-LHR and return. Having never flown with Qatar (normally a Singapore customer) I was tempted by the price and time saved by flying through the Middle East. Can't really fault the experience too much and would recommend them. The PER-DOH flight was a 777 and very comfortable. Lots of leg room and space - felt very relaxed. Entertainment was good too with plenty of films etc. The new Dreamliner flight from DOH-LHR was nearly as good but definitely more cramped. Knees pressing against seat in front. Those IFE boxes have a lot to answer for especially on aisle seats - feet space is minimal. Luckily for me on all 4 flights I had no one sitting next to me so could stretch out. May have been lower score if flight was full. Food and service on all flights was as good as it gets although return trip to Perth was a bit lacking as they were tight with offering up water. Doha airport is in the middle of an upgrade so it was a bit chaotic but ok. Definitely would fly with them again.

And in one word - excellent. A320 (or was it 321?) out of Trivandrum to Doha big comfortable seat - a proper business/1st class seat not a pretend one like most airlines use on their single-aisle short-haul aircraft. A 50-minute transfer in Doha which went very smoothly (would I have made it if I'd had baggage or been in economy?) and a lie-flat seat on a 777 to LHR. Very attentive FAs decent food excellent AVOD on time (actually half-hour early in to LHR thanks to wind).

Jacquart Champagne and Janneau Cognac were served during the flight cabin crew was very attentive. However food options limited and quite low-quality. IFE poor this time with a very small choice of new movies and music albums. Seats were quite comfortable. All-day snack is very repetitive for frequent flyer always the same pizza and almond cake! Transfer at Doha was ok but I hate that old airport. It's a good new to know that they will shift soon to new terminal.

The service was excellent hard working staff in DOH. Nairobi Staff were too serious could smile a little more. Food was ok but I would like some changes as the meals have been the same over the last 2 years. IFE was excellent but the seat space was a little too tight. Excited to Fly with QR again this December and can't wait to Experience the 787 from CPH!

D Chatzi",,1st November 2013,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,,4,yes,7,ATH-DOH-DXB on 320 and 787 respectively. All flights on time with smooth transfers in DOH. That said new airport must open ASAP as it will make the experience much more pleasant. Staff attentive and friendly but would have liked to see a few more smiles especially during service time. Food and beverages good well presented. Cabin atmosphere nice and relaxing but the seat comfort on the dreamliner not so good. Pre-departure services efficient but I have seen better and far more impressive. IFE needs to be updated and offer more alternatives. Too much Bollywood and Arabic stuff needs more options. DOH-DXB we were not offered headphones because 'it is a very short flight' as we were advised. Their 4-star competition does offer headsets on this route though. All in all a nice experience would definitely recommend but a little overestimated airline.

Thomas Johnston",,30th October 2013,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,MAN-DOH-BKK. Check in at Manchester was fine due to my height 6ft’6 I'd asked for a note to be posted on the system asking for a seat with extra legroom. Priority boarding for Privilege Club members took off a few minutes late flight seemed to be full. The cabin crew soon were coming around with drinks and menus entertainment system ready for use I checked what was on offer and was watching my first choice movie when the meal was served. I had a chicken noodle dish which was one the best meals I'd had in economy class. I rarely sleep on a flight but I may have dozed off for a few minutes before watching a few more movies. Arrived at Doha earlier than expected I had 1 hour 20 minutes transit so had booked the Al Maha Fast track service a very efficient young lady met me at the plane and travelled with me on the transfer bus escorted me direct to the onward check-in for the next flight and straight passed the queue to the departure bus. Bangkok flight was on 777 a vast improvement on the airbus comfort wise similar to previous flight movie and a little doze had a walk down to the galley for a drink and spent some time chatting to the cabin crew. A nice breakfast and arrived in Bangkok on time. Luggage already on the conveyor by the time I'd cleared customs. When I checked in for return flight I used my Qmiles to upgrade to business class from Doha - Manchester so checked in at the business counter and discovered I'd been upgraded to Silver level so I was given access to the priority customers clearance and a pass to the business lounge a nice surprise. Just after boarding the senior cabin attendant came to see me and explained she was aware that my next flight was in business and that prior to landing in Doha she would move me to a seat closer to the business cabin so I could go on the business class but direct to the premium terminal. I spent 8 hours in Doha that the reason for the upgrade to business had a nice dinner followed by breakfast before boarding the flight. Business cabin had only 10 passengers so we were all spoilt by the best cabin crew I've experienced members of the crew introduced themselves and chatted to passengers.

The hand-lotion had disappeared 30 minutes after departure and was not been replaced. The airport is so crowed (might not be the fault of the airline) maybe not for business flyers (hopefully it can join One-World quicker so that when I use the airport next time I can use their lounge). The super cheap ticket is good that it is accessible for many people but the coin definitely has another side!

S Sutton",,29th October 2013,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,2,no,5,We flew recently from London to Kuala Lumpur Malaysia via Doha. The entire trip (to and from) consisted of four 7-hour flights with approximately 2-4 hours stopover at Doha Airport. While we do not have any major complaints Qatar Airways in our opinion do not deserve a 5* airline rating for economy class. The cleanliness of the plane left a lot to be desired. On all four legs of the journey scraps of litter could be seen near the window seats. Food remnants were found on the fold-down table and on the cushion supplied. We were generally satisfied in terms of the level of service food entertainment and the comfort of seat. The touch screen can be a bit hit-and-miss and on one of our flights my partner's TV screen was faulty. Staff were all very polite although it would be interesting to see how they cope if the plane was busier. Previous experience with Emirates were far more satisfactory.

What bothered us was: Half of the plane was very hot and the other half was freezing (same thing happened last year). That each of us including a 2-year old baby were assigned seats in an entirely different location. The entertainment systems often had some minor faults (kept fast forwarding movies if one put their arm on the armrest some buttons did not work at all). Will try a different route next time if possible.

Purser came around to make personal introduction and to explain flight amenities. Food was outstanding and the wine choices were top notch (including a 2003 Brunello di Montalcino). All flights were on time or early. The only strange part of the whole experience is the long bus ride from the plane to the terminals - I did it twice as I was transiting through DOH. The Business Class Lounge is probably one of the most grand and well-served that I have experienced. There are multiple stations for tea/coffee snacks full meals and a fully stocked bar. They also provide table service. Flight departures are announced discreetly but effectively.

The flight attendants were pleasant and efficient. The Premium Lounge in Doha is very comfortable meeting all our needs and transit time was short. We've been flying this route for 3 years now and have not had any delays. We flew a B777-200 to Doha and A330-200 to Dhaka. Just love the young fleet. The only negative is that the lie flat beds on theA330 which do not completely lie flat are not as comfortable as on the B777. Can't wait to fly Qatar again.

Flew the Dreamliner 787 from LHR-DOH fantastic aircraft great in-flight entertainment the steward(ess's) were all friendly and smiling food was really tasty seats were comfortable too. Transfer from aircraft to terminal in Doha was quite lengthy but guess that will improve once they have the new terminal. From DOH-NBO it was an A320 small aircraft but comfortable and again good food and service throughout. The only complaint I have about the flight was that my flight was from 16.00 GMT+1 arriving in NBO 05.35 (GMT+1) and on the LHR-DOH leg they said they don't provide amenity kits because its a day flight (I only wanted the sleeping shades) and then when I got onto the DOH-NBO flight again they don't provide the amenity kits (the flight was from 02.20 - 07.35 GMT+3). Then they serve Dinner on this 2am flight without a doubt the foods great but its 2am and I wanted to sleep. So if your flying on some overnight flight then take your own in economy!

Seats comfortable service excellent and inflight entertainment good. Overnight flight and managed to get sleep. Only criticism is they turned lights on a bit early before landing in DOH. Had a quick transfer in DOH for flight to SIN but waited on ground for other connections so flight departed 80 mins late. Plane from DOH to SIN a 777 which was bigger than 330. Again seats good but service very poor with 2 cabin attendants who must have come from BA they were so surly. Inflight entertainment system slower than the flight from LHR. On plus side the 2 flights were the smoothest and quietest I have ever had from UK to SIN. Airline a good 4 star but not 5.

Michael Schrier",,13th October 2013,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,5,no,7,My wife and I travelled from Manila-Doha-Oslo (Business Class) on 24th/25th Sep 2013. I have nothing but praise for the attendants and aircraft on the outbound journey. First leg was a 777ER this is still a great plane. Second leg was on a 787 Dreamliner this plane makes even the 777 seem obsolete. Inbound journey from Oslo to Doha was again a Dreamliner and was as close to perfect as you could ask for. When we boarded the flight from Doha to Manila on 10th Sep 2013 it was not good from the start. We have flown many times on Qatar Business Class and this was the first time the attendant just pointed up the aisle and said the 2 seats up front on the right. When it came to food I chose the seafood entree and the lobster part was still half frozen there was no tablecloth or serviettes. At least for the main course we were then given tablecloth and serviettes. However we both chose the tenderloin beef this turned out to be dry and overcooked. I was asked which wine would I like I chose a Chardonnay which was excellent but when I asked for another I was given about a tablespoon full and was told they had run out. This flight is always overbooked so it makes sense for the airline to fill the seats. In doing this though the moment these people see free unlimited food and drink they consume it like there is no tomorrow. The plane was an Airbus which is not of the quality of their Boeings due to its age and the seat leg lift did not raise so I ended up with swollen feet as I do in economy. Luckily we spent all our Qmiles on duty free in Doha so now I will try another airline next time. It is a shame as we have never had anything but praise for Qatar.

M Kent",,10th October 2013,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,7,Aspires to be a 'five' star airline. We flew UK to Malaysia via Doha two 7hr legs with a 3hr stop over in Doha. Planes were pretty clean seats fairly comfortable but we had a much newer plane on the 2nd outbound leg and this was the best leg of our return trips. Staff were very nice drinks plentiful and varied food pretty good too. Entertainment system worked fine good selection of films/TV to keep you busy. MAS we have flown before are a 5* airline the planes and service just that bit better though you do pay more. Baggage allowance was increased just before we flew to 30kg. They are also fairly relaxed on hand luggage which does mean the overhead storage fills up! The transfer in Doha involved a lengthy bus shuttle to/from the terminal building but perhaps we were unlucky where our planes were parked. I'd use again but would weigh up the saving over a direct flight as there's not much in Doha!

R John",,10th October 2013,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,7,MEL-DOH-BCN. I think it is important that if you have connecting flight via DOH you need at least a 2 hour transit time between flights because the bussing between the planes and terminal is painstakingly slow. This will of course improve when the new airport is finished. I've come to the conclusion that a long haul economy flight on any airline can become hell on earth after several hours. Crying babies and a too cold cabin only add to the discomfort. The seat in front of me seemed to recline just a little too far and I felt literally boxed in. Qatar do make an effort to make flights a little more comfortable. Great food and staff as well as comfortable seating certainly helped.

IAH-DOH - Incoming aircraft had a lightening strike on its way in and needed a complete check by engineers in Houston. This delayed the flight by over 5 hours and everyone missed connections in DOH. Qatar staff in Doha came through for everyone with alternate flights already worked out by the time we reached DOH. Most people were provided transit visas and accommodation with a generous food allowance in DOH. IFE was good food was okay. Cabin staff was polite and helpful. DOH-CCU - Cabin crew excellent. I had a non functional IFE screen and they tried a restart thrice. After that they switched my seat. The food service was thorough service was attentive and I felt comfortable in a flight with service after a long time. CCU-DOH - Good cabin crew good food and attentive service. Ground staff from Air India could not keep up with the Qatar staff and fumbled the service all through. On the flight smooth sailing. DOH-IAH - Attentive cabin crew and good service all round. The only negative was when they ran out of meal options for the lunch service and had to force the same veg option on everyone. IFE malfunctioned during the flight and they reset the whole system that took 30 mins or so. However IFE service was good. Overall satisfied with the service crew and IFE. It would be better for them to rethink their Indian choice for veg as the food tends to get too dry over a long haul flight.

Norman Lee",,1st October 2013,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,SIN-DOH-MAN/BRU-DOH-SIN. Excellent on-board service and the seat pitch is the best I have seen in Economy for a long time. The 777s use 3-3-3 configuration which makes for a comfortable seat. Pouches with toothbrush socks ear plugs and eye-mask were given out on the overnight sectors. Only thing that could get better was on the BRU- DOH sector crew ran out of food trays at the back of the plane and had to ask a few times from the crew in the front. I also had to remind the crew that my travelling companion needed a diabetic meal. But these are small issues. In all value for money better than the other airlines who try to pack close to 400 passengers on their 777s for the same price.

Great new fleet even the older A320s and A330s are new compared to other major airlines. Newer 777s are gorgeous though have flaws (like stuck TV screens and dirty seats). Food is average. When connecting for hours in Doha you still find yourself with a breakfast omelette followed by another breakfast omelette on the next flight? Entertainment system - good when it works. Great selection but on 6 flights I had 3 seats without working TV and 4 headphones that did not work. Service - pretty poor. Staff are generally indifferent friendly-but-dazed. Timeliness - my experience has not tracked with the on-time stats of the airline. I had one out of six flights depart on time. The rest arrived late by an hour or so. Very decent option for the price but not anywhere as good an experience as its ""5 Star"" competitors such as Singapore or Cathay."

They have great selection of food and entertainment and if your lucky enough for an overnight flight a great pouch consisting of socks eye-mask and toothbrush. Anytime you ask for help or are served the flight attendants have a smile. For the money - this is by far my favorite airline."

S Chim",,25th September 2013,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,7,SIN-DOH-BRU and TXL-DOH-SIN. Food onboard was acceptable. Seats were fairly comfortable. Inflight service ranged from average to outstanding depending on the flight attendant. Inflight entertainment was very good. The problem was the transit at Doha it was nothing short of a disaster. The buses that take you to and from the terminal were excruciatingly slow and extremely packed. Even though the bus doors were shut the buses didn't move and we were on the tarmac for about 15 minutes. No announcement no apologies. The terminal itself was packed when we got there and clearly did not have enough toilets. While they were not downright filthy they were certainly not the cleanest toilets in any airport anywhere. After having our boarding pass scanned for the transfer flight we took an escalator down to the waiting area in the bus bay. We waited more than an hour there with about 10 seats no toilets in a room that could comfortably only hold 25 passengers but is now holding a whole plane load. Many started sitting/sleeping on the floor. When it was time to board the bus a stone faced staff member came down to tell us to queue up. Again no announcement no apologies just do as you're told. When the bus got to the plane surprise surprise the doors stayed closed and we stayed inside the packed bus for another 15 minutes. Only on the plane did the captain explain that the aircraft came in late resulting in the delay. I wouldn't want to do another transit in Doha again at least not until their new airport is completed.

C Rick",,24th September 2013,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,7,SIN-DOH-LHR-DOH-SIN. New plane for SIN-DOH-SIN good service but not comparable with SQ or CX. DOH-LHR-DOH on dated A330 Inflight entertainment system old with technical issues both ways. However will still use QR for its cheap fare.

B Dawood",,24th September 2013,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,London to Dubai via Doha. The service received from the check in desk to all air crew was impeccable. Seats were of good comfort in economy and leg room was good as well. Inflight entertainment had a large number of choices to choose from. A bit of everything for everyone. Was travelling with a 5 Year old and catered their needs well as well as giving well presented child's meal. Only the transfer at Doha needs to improve a bit as having go by coach to the transit and aircraft is annoying. But overall very good and the best service I have had on anyone airline I have travelled that includes BA Virgin and emirates.

W Harsha",,24th September 2013,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,LHR-DXB return via DOH. First leg on A330 - seat and entertainment fine. I hold privilege club gold status and was greeted onboard by crew. Meal choices outlined were inconsistent with what was actually served. Overnight flight which departed one hour late - cabin lights dimmed after dinner service but fully illuminated three hours before landing when they served a snack (which was appalling). Missed connecting flight in Doha but was already booked onto the next flight and had to wait only 90 mins. Second leg on a new A321 with touchscreen entertainment. Crew were polite and efficient. Snack served on this 40minute flight consisted of a savoury and sweet breakfast - which was horrible. A microwaved sandwich and a muffin. Return DXB-DOH again new A321 crew once again polite efficient and friendly. Awful snack once more. DOH-LHR leg was disappointing. The flight was full and on a A330 which was clearly showing its age. Old style IFE - with controller inbuilt into the armrest - which makes it very awkward to operate. Crew were clearly over stretched and somewhat inexperienced forgetting requests and serving wrong meals. I will continue to fly QR but the decline in catering is a concern. Also I have noticed that some crew lack the hospitality which has made QR deserve its 5* status. I remain committed to flying QR whenever possible and will continue to recommend.

O Hammoudy",,24th September 2013,,Economy Class,,,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,5,yes,7,MCT-DOH-CAI. First leg served with an old and cramped A320. Inflight catering for that leg was not the best just an average snack crew members were doing a good job on that sector. Transit in Doha was a short one around 2 hrs. The terminal itself is so boring if compared to EK's T3 at DXB with a very limited food outlets and coffee shops. The Second leg was served with the companies pride not the 787 but the 777-300ER I would say that the aircraft is pretty much enjoyable in the 3-3-3 abreast layout over Emirates 3-4-3 which gives a feeling of flying a budget airline. Cabin crew on the second leg were just missing the proficiency of a five star airline. Wont hesitate to fly QR again for the sake of the cheap fares.

Alan Gibb",,24th September 2013,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,We flew to Manchester from HK last month with our baby son. On 3 legs of the trip the service and general experience could not be faulted in particular the cabin crew were genuinely caring for our son providing him with chocolates toys and carrying him around the airplane. On the Doha - Manchester leg of the journey the service was appalling very offhand perhaps not helped by the fact there were extra demands on the attendants due to the fact the in-flight entertainment was not working but our baby son was ignored right down to fact there was no offer of baby food for him! So 3 legs unsurpassed service far superior to my experience on my regular business class airlines but of course what one remembers unfortunately was the one poor experience which was made more memorable by how good the rest of the journey was.

S Venkatraman",,22nd September 2013,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Been a Qatar frequent flier for a couple of years. Gold card holder and choose Qatar as the preferred airline. Generally extremely Professional and experienced crew. In recent times have noticed that the quality of Food can be much better. I generally choose AVML as the Choice. On the last flight from DOH-OSL I was served a chicken sandwich instead of vegetarian. Been served Pasta as AVML on one of the flights. Food quality is one thing that I believe that QR has dropped in. Customer service is still good (even if an occasional mistake happens). The thing that I did not like on my OSL-DOH flight is that they introduced the 787. I would any day prefer the Comfort of the 777-300ER.

Julian Walby",,22nd September 2013,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,7,Return flight to from London to KL via Doha. 3 of the 4 aircraft's were modern and clean with great in-flight entertainment (all newish A330s) and very good food. Last flight (Doha to London) was awful. Old A330 very smelly not especially clean and rubbish in-flight entertainment. A real disappointment but would not put me off flying Qatar again as generally excellent. Doha airport isn't as bad as everyone says but the busses to and from the terminal do take forever and aren't particularly well air conditioned.

C Sansom",,22nd September 2013,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,LHR-DOH-DXB-DOH-LHR. 4 flights on B787/A320/A330. Excellent flights with very smart and professional cabin crew. The meals were tasty and of good quality and nicely presented. 5 star and very happy to travel again.

Terry Curtise",,19th September 2013,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,BKK-DOH 16/09/2013. A true 5 star airline. Seats very spacious and comfortable. Staff very attentive and helpful. Great selection of food IFE very good with a great range of new release and classic films. Will fly Qatar whenever possible.

K Daidola",,15th September 2013,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,Had high expectations flying with this 5 star airline. We decided on the route MAD-DOH-BKK-DOH-MAD to fly with Qatar for the first time. It was basically all above average but a bit short for a 5 star. No surprises all was efficient smooth and professional. The 777-300 was used on all our four flights. Great entertainment system although the boxes takes up some leg space. Food was correct and service professional but felt quite robotic. Drinks were served frequently during the flights. Planes were all clean and in very good appearance. Doha airport is a problem long bus rides to and from the plane. This will be solved once the new airport opens. We hoped for it to be so before our trip but they still have no date.

James Tinning",,12th September 2013,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Perth WA to London LHR on 8 August. I have never felt so well looked after onboard any airline. Despite the length of this journey (22 hours) I thoroughly enjoyed it. Perth - Doha leg was onboard a B777-200LR a very comfortable aircraft. The IFE was brilliant and I was well entertained by (literally) 100s of movies games and television shows. The cabin was ambient with a lovely mood-lighting system. The connection at Doha International was smooth and took me just 1hr and 30 minutes to be onboard my London-bound flight coming from the 777. Doha is a very pleasant airport and a much newer one is on the way. The London leg was onboard B787 and had a very comfortable arrangement (as do all Qatar Aircraft) with Thales IFE. Again wonderful entertainment. The food was wonderful at all parts of the journey and various meals are provided with generous portions. The cabin crew were so professional and smart very friendly. I am very much looking forward to flying Qatar again.

A Davidson",,5th September 2013,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,MAN-DOH-SIN-DOH-MAN. A330 first leg. Really comfortable seat but preferred 777 on second leg which was perfect lie flat seat and so much roomier. Staff were excellent and couldn't do enough - very polite and attentive. Good Oryx system great headsets and good choice of films. Food excellent and as much drink as you like. The only disappointment was the 'fast track' luggage. Most of economy had left the airport whilst business class were still standing at the conveyor waiting for theirs 40 minutes later!

J Barnes",,5th September 2013,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,10,MEL-DOH and DOH-MEL. On flight home mobile phone (on charge) slipped down into seat table mechanism and couldn't be retrieved by hand. Head steward did everything he could to no avail. On arrival he had arranged for an engineer to board plane to dismantle seat. The phone was delivered back to us while waiting for luggage The effort of staff to do their best was appreciated.

Gerard Adams",,4th September 2013,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,no,7,Qatar-Seychelles QR703 1 Aug 2013. Doha-Melbourne. QR30. 2 Aug and returned departing 25 August QR31 to Doha and 27 Aug QR702 to Seychelles. While in general we were satisfied with the flights there are a number of issues I would like to raise: 1) We were seated in row 24 on QR30 about halfway down economy. When the meal trolley came we were told instead of the 3 meal options only one was still available. 2) When I asked for a glass of wine I was told it would be brought later. It arrived after my meal was finished. 3) On the return leg my wife who has a bladder problem asked if the trolley could be moved to allow her out. She was told she would have to wait until the attendants had finished and were ready to move on. 4) QR31 25 August was heavily booked. When the lights were brightened after approximately 10 hours there was naturally a rush for the toilets. The number provided on the 777 is in my opinion inadequate. Long queues soon formed.

Prakash Selvam",,3rd September 2013,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,MAA-DOH-CDG-JFK (round trip) with our 19 month old infant. CDG-JFK flight was hectic (AA flight) with no legroom. The food was fantastic and the crew were great. Oryx Entertainment system was really good and easy to handle. The whole experience was positive.

A Shaban",,2nd September 2013,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,3,no,6,KHI-DOH-JFK-DOH-KHI August 2013. Staff service still remains excellent. On JFK-DOH sector the cabin crew were the most efficient and helpful crew I have encountered in 20 years. On my last leg of journey the entertainment system was not working. Seat has limited recline. QR needs to improve or may lose the Business class segment of it's loyal customers. Premier lounge at Doha is still excellent but Premier lounge duty free shop has very limited selection of products.

J Halton",,1st September 2013,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,PER-DOH-LHR on 13 August and LHR-DOH-PER 24 August. 777's all flights. I had a great experience. Staff were very attentive plenty of drinks offered between meals. Food was adequate and on the longer legs there were sandwiches and cakes available in the galley. Seating comfortable the 3-3-3 configuration helps enormously. I was able to stretch out a bit due to some empty seats on the longer legs but even on the packed DOH-LHR flights it was great to have the leg room. The Oryx entertainment system was fine for me. Some new releases and plenty of old favourites. Nice to get an amenity kit on the longer flights also. I would definitely choose to fly with Qatar Airways again but it will be even better once the new airport is built in Doha.

P J Trebuchet",,29th August 2013,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,3,yes,6,"DXB-DOH-BCN 2013 July 19th. A good flight overall but it quality of service went without a doubt down those last months. Always the same mess at DXB Terminal 1 check-in counter Dnata handling group is really a disaster. For this only reason you might prefer to fly Emirates which does not outsource its Terminal 3 to Dnata. Doha airport also was chaotic with very long bus rides and disorganized ground staff. Food service was appalling on DXB-DOH leg (a half burnt-half frozen spinach ""sandwich"") however breakfast and snack served on DOH-BCN flight were both good without being outstanding. Cabin crew were very professional and attentive to the aircraft's cleanliness. QR remains a good choice."

D Hicks",,29th August 2013,,Economy Class,,,5.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,,,3,no,6,"LHR-DOH-BKK return in economy. A frequent flyer with Qatar since 2009 I can say that they have really gone ""downhill"" and no longer deserve a 5* rating in economy class. While the aircraft are still modern with new aircraft always arriving the seats spacious (except for 787) and the in-flight entertainment is good the food and drinks have really become poor. They are as bad now as on many US carriers or worse. In contrast in 2009 Qatar had gourmet restaurant quality food. The levels and quality of service from most cabin crews has also declined to being very average. It is very rare for example to see a tray of drinks being carried around now between meals. Overall I would not recommend Qatar Airways any more."

O Hammoudy",,26th August 2013,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,7,CAI-DOH-MCT. First sector was served with a very newish A320 which to me offered more comfort than travelling on an A330 or even a 77W the small a/c came equipped with PTVs wide selection of audio and video entertainment all you need and more for this medium haul flight. Food was better than my last EK trip last week but served in very small amounts. Transit in Doha was critically short in time however its nowhere close to EK's T3 at DXB. The next leg was a short hop to Muscat served with a very old and torn out A320 with over head entertainment system. Bottom line I choose QR because they offer the best fare every time I fly this route and its worth every penny.

K OConnor",,20th August 2013,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,SIN-DPS-SIN. New B777 with 3-3-3 in economy vs 3-4-3 with Emirates giving plenty of room width ways and I could quite comfortably stretch out length ways. Nice cabin interior cabin crew responded quickly to the call button. Meal adequate for a two and a half hour flight in Y class. No news papers or magazines but the Oryx inflight entertainment would keep you from getting bored. Baggage allowance of 23kg adequate for a long weekend in Bali but Emirates and Etihad are now giving 30kg. Business class seats looked wide and comfortable compared to Etihad's which are a bit narrow. I look forward to flying on Qatar Airways again they are now on my favourite airline list.

Michael Schade",,15th August 2013,,Business Class,,,5.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,,,2,no,4,SIN-DPS return. SIN-DPS section delayed by an hour no explanation or apology given. Great seats and IFE. No blankets available food was like economy class food on chinaware. No Indonesia immigration cards so a further delay at DPS airport. DPS was a crowded lounge the comfortable section with sofas was for Qatar Airways crew on the flight. DPS- SIN average in terms of service and catering. Not really what I expect from a 5 star airline especially when flying business class.

R Nash",,12th August 2013,,First Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,Flew first class CAI-DOH on QR503 on 8th Aug 2013. Qatar VIP lounge in CAI is a dump. VIP lounge is roofless and full of flies and A/C is pathetic. Can't really blame Qatar here it's an Egyptian problem. 95% of Qatar staff in CAI were good. Left CAI 20 mins early at 06.00 hrs. Travelled on Airbus A321 and was disappointed to find seats did not fully recline. Stewardesses and stewards were attentive and well-trained. Food and drink on board was top class. Aircraft was clean and fairly new and everything worked. Got to DOH and had 15 hr layover in VIP lounge there which is nothing short of outstanding. Showers TV's free internet recliner beds for snoozing massage chairs manned security lockers family area business facilities. Food and drink availability in VIP lounge is exceptional and all staff were eager to please courteous and well-trained. This airline is punctual and truly a 5 star airline and I will fly with them again anytime.

Gamage Champika",,6th August 2013,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,,4,yes,7,I took a flight to London on 17th July with my 3.5 year old son and wife. Travelling with kids is not easy as they constantly require something to focus their attention to without which they can easily get irritable. We were hoping that the inflight entertainment system would provide ample entertainment to keep my son occupied. Unfortunately the entertainment system suffered technical problems throughout the journey from Doha to London and none of us were able to watch anything. Eventually it turned out to be a boring flight as well as a stressful one. What's more the pilot did not even acknowledge that there was a problem as he should have at least apologized to all the passengers with regards to this shortcoming.

Martin Fernandez",,6th August 2013,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,no,5,MAD-DOH-DXB and back. Boeing 777 in MAD-DOH sectors was nice spacious 3-3-3 configuration and good legroom and IFE. Service and food was good but not outstanding as one expects from a 5-star airline. Boeing 787 in DOH-DXB sectors was amazing very modern and quiet airplane although seating would be a little bit tight for a long haul flight. The worst thing about Qatar Airways is Doha Airport it is very uncomfortable. It was crowded bathrooms were dirty and food options very limited. We had a very long bus ride from the terminal to the plane in the DOH- DXB flight. While boarding for the DOH-MAD flight we had to wait for half an hour for the bus to take us to the plane standing for that time in a crowded and small room at 2am is not a 5-star experience. I won't fly with them again until the opening of the new Doha Airport.

David Monteiro",,6th August 2013,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,3,yes,7,GVA-AUH A320. Good food but after the main meal nothing else was served which I find a bit disappointing. Flight attendants served plenty of drinks throughout the flight. My IFE froze and I asked the FA to try to reset it but she never did. Seat pitch just OK. Overall a good product compared to European carriers.

A Boorman",,5th August 2013,,Economy Class,,,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,,,2,no,3,London Heathrow - Yangon via Doha return. First three flights were okay - check in staff at LHR a little rude. Economy class seating meal options inflight entertainment all very reasonable but I didn't see the five star airline reputation particularly. Final leg Myanmar to Doha was overbooked and I was kicked off with nosearch for volunteers (seemingly as were a lot of other single male travellers) resulting in a 13 hour layover in Doha. Placed on a 2am flight home and Doha airport was dreadful - food appalling customer service desk rammed and understaffed the staff who were on duty were rude and nobody actually seemed to know where my luggage was. DOH-LHR I have never been treated so rudely by airline staff (told I was in the wrong area when I accidentally went to the wrong toilet). There was a total lack of organisation with this airline.
